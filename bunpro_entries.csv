飽くまでも,あくまでも,,"To the (bitter) end, Stubbornly, Persistently","飽 く is the old-fashioned and somewhat poetic version of 飽 きる the る-Verb meaning 'to tire of (A)', or 'to get sick of (A)'. When used in conjunction with the adverbial particles まで 'until', and も 'even', 飽 くまでも will imply that (A) is being done 'persistently', 'stubbornly', or 'to the bitter end'. The more literal translation of 'to continue (A) even to the point of getting tired of it' fits these interpretations quite well. 飽 くまでも will often come at the beginning of sentences before going on to describe that thing that is being done persistently. も is not required, and 飽 くまで may sometimes be seen without it. However, as the phrase is quite strong, it is far more common for も to be included to highlight the emphasis. Due to the persistence that the verb 飽 く itself can highlight, it will often be seen together in sentences that include words like つもり 'intention', to show that someone intends to do something regardless of the consequences. Despite 飽 くまで being a combination of 飽 く and まで, it will appear in most dictionaries as a standalone adverb in modern Japanese.",N1
挙句,あげく,,"After, In the end, After all, Eventually","挙句 'in the end', is a noun used in Japanese to express a negative result that occurs, despite a considerable amount of time, effort, or resources that was put into (A). あげく will often be used in situations where the escalating situation of (A) somehow caused or prompted the negative result of (B). あげく will appear after the past-tense form of verbs, or after nouns followed by の. Alternatively, あげく may be used to express some sort of troublesome or negative process that led to the conclusion of (B). In these cases, the outcome itself may not be undesirable, but arriving at that result of (B) somehow was. Caution あげく will most often be in hiragana, but the forms 挙句 and 挙 げ 句 are also quite common. Fun-fact 挙句 originally referred to the final line of a 連歌 (a form of early Japanese poetry), and literally means 'the tying up phrase', or 'the concluding phrase'.",N2
あげる,あげる,v-unspec,"To give (away), To present, To provide","あげる is a verb with many uses in Japanese. It's original meaning is 'to raise', but is also used as a polite speech way of saying 'to give'. In this way it can be thought of as similar to 'to offer up' in English. As polite speech has the same basic subject and object rules as standard speech, the giver will be marked with は or が , while the recipient will be marked with に . As usual, the 'object' that is being given will be marked with を . From these three examples, we can see that the order of 'giver', 'recipient', and 'object' does not matter, so long as the correct particles are used. Caution あげる should not be used when giving something to someone of a higher status, or when lowering oneself to elevate another. This is done through honorific language , or humble speech , and will use different verbs. Fun Fact Although あげる is considered polite speech, it is the most natural way of saying 'to give'. やる is the 'casual' equivalent of あげる , but due to やる sounding a little bit rough, あげる became the standard.",N5
あそこ,あそこ,n,Over there,"Like ここ and そこ , あそこ is a word that is used to identify a place in Japanese. The place that あそこ will be used to identify is somewhere that is separated from both the speaker and the listener. This translates roughly to 'that place over there' in English. あそこ can be used to identify both physical locations, and emotional ones. In the same way that あれ can be used to point back to something that was mentioned previously, あそこ can be used to point back to a place that was mentioned previously. However, unlike それ or そこ , あれ and あそこ will only be used this way when both the speaker and listener have intimate knowledge of the topic. Caution あそこ should not be confused with あっち, a similar word which is also sometimes translated as 'over there'. あっち focuses more on the direction that one is/is going, while あそこ focuses purely on 'that place'.",N5
あっての,あっての,,"Exist only because of or due to, Owe everything to","あっての is a pattern which emphasizes that (B) is something that only exists because of (A). It will often be translated as '(B) owes everything to (A)', or '(B) existing is only due to (A)'. This structure is a combination of the う-Verb ある 'to be' in its て-form, and the case-marking particle の. あっての will be preceded and followed directly by nouns, where the first noun is (A), and the second noun is (B). あっての will primarily be used when (B) is something that benefits positively from (A), and therefore is showing or should show some kind of gratitude toward it. Occasionally, the case-marking particle が will come between the (A) noun and あっての . However, it is often omitted. Fun Fact あっての can be thought of as an evolution of the basic grammar structure がある 'to have'. The main difference being that の allows (B) to be marked as the thing that has (A), while the て-form indicates that there is more information that will be given later about why this is important. Due to this information that comes later being important, (B) will almost always be followed by structures like から, or ので.",N1
後で,あとで,,"After, Later","In Japanese, あとで is a combination of the noun 後 (behind), and the particle で (with). When these words are linked, they form an adverbial phrase which is used to express 'after', or 'later'. As with で 's standard meaning of 'with', あとで is simply highlighting that something will happen, 'with' the 'after/behind' part of something. To use あとで , attach it to the end of any past-tense verb, noun followed by の , or verb followed by のは (nominalization). Fun Fact The reason that 後 is translated as both 'after', and 'behind', is because sequences of events in Japanese behave similarly to a train. When the head of the train (one action) passes a specific point, there are still potentially many carriages (other actions) coming 'after', or 'behind' it. 後 で may also be used to alter the meaning of an entire phrase, by appearing at the front. This nuance is just that (A) will happen (at some point) after now.",N4
あの,あの,n,That (over there),"あの is classified as a ' pre-noun adjectival ' in Japanese. These are a special type of word that do not conjugate. This means that they will always appear in the same form. あの comes from the same family of words as あれ and あそこ , and is used to identify a 'thing' that is away from both the listener, and the speaker. It is usually translated as 'that' (thing over there). As the name ' pre-noun adjectival ' suggests, these words will always appear before a noun, and describe that noun in some way.",N5
余りに,あまりに,,"So much...that, (Way) too...","Being the adverbial form of 余 る 'excess', あまりに is a grammar structure that is used to convey an 'excessive' amount of something that caused a certain result. あまりに will almost always be used in sentences expressing some sort of surprise/shock about the degree of (A). Often, あまりに is translated simply as 'so much (A) that (B)', or 'way too much (A)'. In the last example, we can see that あまり will be followed by の when linked to a noun. Occasionally, にも will be used instead of に . This just emphasizes the 'excess' of (A) further. As the literal meaning of あまりに is quite close to 'excessively', it may be easier to remember this translation, rather than 'so much (A) that (B)'. Usually, 'it is excessively (A), so (B)' will cover most possible nuances. Caution あんまり is a colloquial variant of あまり that is often said, but should be avoided in any form of formal/official writing.",N3
余り～ない,あまり～ない,,"Not very, Not much, Not really, Hardly","あまり is a very flexible word in Japanese, that is used in several different grammar points. When paired with the ない form of a word, it translates to 'not very (A)', or 'hardly (A)'. To pair あまり (or the casual form, あんまり ) with another word, we just need to place it at the beginning of a phrase, or directly before the ない statement. Fun Fact Although あまり～ない is regularly translated as 'not very' the literal translation is closer to 'not excessively (A)'. This is due to 余 り (the kanji which this word comes from), meaning 'excessive', or 'to be in excess'. あまり has this meaning of 'excessive' in all of its grammar points, and the nuance will only change based on whether the sentence itself is positive (does not use ない), or negative (uses ない).",N4
余り,あまり,,So much...that,"As a noun , あまり means 'excess', and refers to an amount of something that is in surplus. This noun is quite often used after many different types of words, to indicate that something happened/exists to an excessive degree (which then resulted in something negative occurring). By itself, 余 り is not negative. However, this grammar point can be thought of as a set phrase that is generally used in negative situations. To use あまり, you will need to attach it to the end of the following structures. A verb, an い-Adjective (that has been turned into a noun through the use of さ or み) followed by の, a な-Adjective followed by な, or a noun followed by の. Then, after あまり, a (B) phrase will highlight what the negative result was. Caution The tense of the overall sentence will be dependent on the first clause. Therefore, it is common to see the verb before あまり being used in several different tenses.",N3
あり,あり,exp,"Possibility, To have, With","あり itself is the literary form of the う-Verb 有 る 'to be', and is used in a similar way to なし. However, rather than meaning that something is 'without (A)', it shows that something is 'with (A), amongst other things'. This 'amongst other things' is important, as あり will primarily be used when something is being presented as a single possibility among many possibilities. あり can be and often is used simply as a reply to a statement to indicate agreement, or that the listener thinks that what the speaker is saying is possible. Caution Occasionally, the kanji 在 る may sometimes also be used. Although the difference between these two kanji is slight, 有 り indicates 'inclusiveness as part of a whole', while 在 り focuses more on 'stand-alone existence'.",N3
或るいは,あるいは,,"Or, Possibly, Maybe, Perhaps, Or possibly","あるいは is a construction in Japanese that is used as a 接続語 (conjunction). It usually appears after statements that have been marked with the adverbial particle か. あるいは may be loosely translated as 'possibly', 'maybe', or 'or'. Although usually being treated as a single word, あるいは is actually a combination of the attributive form of 或 る, a verb meaning 'a certain', the suffix character い (used for making い-Adjectives ), and the adverbial particle は. Due to this, the literal meaning of あるいは is just 'another possibility', as it highlights a certain something existing within the same area/category as (A).",N3
あれ,あれ,n,That (over there),"あれ , just like これ and それ , is one of several 'pronoun-like' words in Japanese ( substitute nouns ). あれ translates roughly to 'that' in English. However, unlike それ , あれ is used to highlight things that are away from both the speaker and the listener. Due to this, it is also often translated as 'that over there'. Caution Be careful not to mix up あれ with the common spoken expression あれ, which means 'huh?', or 'oh?'. These are not the same words. The difference will usually be clear from context within a sentence, and the way the word is said. あれ as 'huh?' has a rising tone, and sounds like a question.",N5
良い,いい,adj-na,い-Adjective meaning 'good',"いい is an adjective that means 'good' in Japanese. It can be a little bit difficult to use at first, as it conjugates differently to other い-Adjectives . In these sentences, we can see that the first い in いい changes to よ, depending on the form. This is unique to いい , and does not happen with other adjectives. いい can sometimes be seen as 良 い , in these cases, the kanji is likely to be read as よい, and not いい. There is technically no difference between these two meanings, but よい does sound more formal/old-fashioned. Caution When used as an adverb, よく should not be confused as a conjugation of いい . よく has several possible kanji that it may stem from, and means frequently/often/well.",N5
如何なる,いかなる,,"What kind of, No matter what kind of, No … (with a negative verb), Any... (with a negative verb)","如何 なる is a combination of 如何 , and なる. なる being derived from the classical auxiliary verb なり 'to be'. 如何 is never used as a word by itself, and will always be attached to something else when it has the reading of いか. However, its meaning is the same as the modern どう 'how'. Because of this, いかなる is interchangeable with どんな 'what kind of', with the exception that it is primarily used only in books and formal writing. いかなる is classified as being attributive, meaning that it will appear directly before a noun, or modify a noun somewhere within the same clause. Just like どんな, when に is added to いかなる , a negative statement will usually follow. This translates as 'no matter how much (A)', or 'no matter what kind of (A)'. However, に will not directly follow いかなる like it does with どんな. Instead, it will appear later in the sentence before the verb. Occasionally, いかな may also be used, but this is far less common. Fun Fact Both な and なる are derived from the classical auxiliary verb なり. Structures that stem from なり can be seen in many modern parts of the Japanese language. This also includes なら, the hypothetical form of だ, which shares the same meaning of 'to be' as なり. While な is the form that appears with most adjectival nouns, なる is still sometimes used in place of な when the speaker wants to be poetic, or give a sense of archaism.",N1
いかん〜ず,いかん〜ず,,"Regardless of (whatever … is), Irrespective of (whatever … is)","When the noun いかん 'how', or 'what' is paired with a verb negated with the classical auxiliary verb ず, it will commonly be translated as 'regardless of (A), (B)', or 'irrespective of (A), (B)'. The verbs used for this construction are restricted to 関 わらず 'without relation', によらず 'without approaching', and を 問 わず 'without questioning. いかん〜ず come after a noun followed by the case marking particle の. いかん〜ず is a formal grammar pattern that is used primarily to express that (B) will not be affected by (A), even if it is something that would usually be expected. Because of this, 'without taking (A) into account' is another fairly accurate translation of the nuance.",N1
以下,いか,,"Less than (or equal to), Under・(and) below, Any less・fewer, Not exceeding","In order to mark something as 'equal to, or less than (A)', 以下 will be used. This is simply a combination of the kanji 以 which means 'by means of', and 下 'below'. This expression may also be translated as 'under (A)', or 'fewer than (A)'. To use 以下 , attach it to the amount that you want to highlight as the 'maximum' amount. Similarly to the way that 以上 can be used to mark 'everything up until now', 以下 can and often is used to highlight 'everything after now', 'the rest', or 'the following'.",N4
以外,いがい,,"Except・besides, Other than, With the exception of","In order to mark something as 'except (A)', or 'besides (A)', 以外 will be used. This construction is a combination of the kanji 以 which means 'by means of', and 外 'outside'. This expression can most accurately be translated as 'with the exception of (A)', or 'everything outside of (A)'. To use 以外 , attach it to the thing that you want to highlight as being the 'all inclusive' amount/area. Fun Fact 以外 is also regularly used simply as an expression of surprise, when someone sees, hears, or reads something that is 'outside' of what they expected. However, in these cases, the more correct kanji construction is 意外 'out of mind'. This is a regular mistake that even native speakers make, so in many  cases, either 意外 or 以外 would be understandable.",N4
いきなり,いきなり,,"For no reason, Suddenly, All of a sudden","いきなり , a word appearing almost exclusively in hiragana, is an adverb that conveys the meaning of 'suddenly', 'all of a sudden', or 'for no reason'. いきなり indicates when something happens abruptly, and without any prior warning. As いきなり is an adverb, it will primarily appear at the beginning of sentences, or directly before the verb that it is describing. Fun-fact いきなり comes from 行 き 成 り , but is rarely seen in its kanji form. This original meaning referred to a particular situation's development or unfolding. Due to this, although often being used purely as 'suddenly', it has a similar nuance to English phrases like 'a sudden turn of events'. This just expresses that the way the situation developed was abrupt or unexpected.",N2
いくら～でも,いくら〜でも,,No matter how (much),"In a similar way to どんなに～ても, いくら～でも is regularly translated to 'no matter how (A), (B)'. However, unlike どんな (which is an abbreviation of どのような), いくら is a noun that comes from the kanji 幾 ら, meaning 'how much'. When partnered with ても (with verbs and い-Adjectives ), or でも (with nouns and な-Adjectives ), the literal meaning means 'however much (A), (B)'. With いくら～でも, the (B) part of the phrase will usually highlight something that is being negated, giving the phrase it's 'no matter how much' nuance. Despite this trend of being used in sentences that contain ない or ありません, いくら～でも may also be seen in positive sentences. In these cases, despite not being negative, the (B) phrase will still be something that is surprising/unexpected in some way (due to its extent or amount). Fun Fact 幾 ら places more emphasis on the 'amount' of something, while どんなに places more emphasis on the 'type', or 'style'. Due to this, いくら will be a better choice when the 'volume' of something is being highlighted, while どんなに will sound more natural when the 'state' is being discussed. Despite this small difference, いくら and どんなに are used fairly interchangeably in most situations.",N3
致す,いたす,,To do (Humble),"いたす , or 致 す as it is often written, is a humble speech う-Verb , which refers to the actions of the speaker (or people within the speakers inner circle, like their company). Similarly to お〜する , いたす means 'to do'. In the case of する verbs themselves, simply replace する with いたす . For other verbs, add いたす to the ます stem of the verb, while attaching お, or ご to the beginning (depending on whether it is a word of Japanese or Chinese origin). Caution Words that include the kanji 拝 'to worship', or 'to revere', do not usually require お, ご, or いたす . This is due to the word itself being 'respectful'. Fun Fact いたす is considered to be slightly more humble than お〜する , which means that it will be heard more frequently in advertisements, or being used by company employees.",N4
いつの間にか,いつの間にか,,"Suddenly, Unnoticed, Without noticing, Too soon","Although a combination of いつ 'when', の, 間 'interval', に, and か; いつの 間 にか is a set expression that is used as a stand-alone adverb to mean 'suddenly', or 'without noticing'. Literally, it just highlights an unknown interval within which something occurred, as seen by the question marking particle, か. Fun-fact Coming mainly from the inclusion か, this grammar pattern often carries the nuance of surprise. When you want to convey the same feeling without the nuance of surprise, あっという 間 に may be used instead. This is a similar expression which literally means 'in the time it takes to say あっ'.",N2
愈々,いよいよ,,"At last, Finally, More and more","愈々 , seen primarily in hiragana, is an adverb that indicates that (A) has or will 'finally happen'. In many cases this is after some state that has been continuing for a long time, or has been compounding further and further until (A). Like many other sentence altering adverbs, いよいよ will appear at the beginning of a phrase. It is also considered quite casual when compared to other grammar points like ついに. As いよいよ highlights something that is compounding, it can also frequently be translated as 'more and more'. The difference between the nuance of いよいよ being 'finally' or 'more and more' will usually be clear due to the statement following it being either conclusive (finally), or inconclusive (more and more).",N2
いらっしゃる,いらっしゃる,,"To be (Honorific), To come (Honorific), To go (Honorific)","いらっしゃる is another of the common honorific language expressions in Japanese. This means that it elevates the status of another person, in order to pay them respect. It will never be used when referring to the speaker themselves, or their own actions. いらっしゃる can be used to replace 居 る 'to be', 来 る 'to come', or 行 く 'to go'. This is due to the unique perspective that honorific language places the speaker in, in relation to the person that is being respected. This is a slightly advanced concept that we will discuss more later. To use いらっしゃる , simply replace いる , くる , or いく with いらっしゃる . Alternatively, いらっしゃる may also be used to replace いる , くる , or いく when they are attached to the て-form of another verb. Fun Fact おいでになる is another expression which can replace いる , くる , or いく. This was briefly examined previously in our お～になる grammar point. おいでになる and いらっしゃる are almost completely interchangable.",N4
いわゆる,いわゆる,,"What is called, So-called, Generally known","いわゆる , occasionally seen in its kanji form 所謂 , is a word that is used before nouns to indicate that something is 'what is called (A)', 'the so-called (A)', or 'generally known as (A)'. いわゆる is a combination of いわ, a modern variant of いは, the indeterminate form of 言 う 'to say', and ゆる, which is the classical literary equivalent of the auxiliary verb れる, the displacement verb indicator in its attributive form. In this way, the literal meaning of 'what is said to be (A)' is carried over into the English translations. Fun-fact The kanji for 謂 means 'oral tradition', and highlights the way that something is referred to over the course of different time periods, or in different places.",N2
く,い-Adj[く],,"Not... or anything, Not at all, Not, By no means, Definitely not, Nothing like that","When paired with the conjunctive form of い-Adjectives, く, もなんともない is often translated as 'not (A) or anything', or 'definitely not (A)'. This is a combination of the adverbial particle も and the adverb 何 ともない 'doesn't amount to anything'. なんともない is often grouped with other negative structures in order to show that the thing it is linked to is not a large amount or considerable extent. In many cases, 何 ともない illustrates that the extent of the thing that it follows is not sufficient to cause a problem. Because of this ～くもなんともない will often be used in sentences where (A) is something that could potentially be an issue, but the speaker is expressing that it has not reached that point, or does not go that far. Because of this, ～くもなんともない is frequently used with adjectives that describe sensations or emotions. Caution This structure is also commonly used with the auxiliary adjective たい, for showing that someone 'doesn't want to do (A)'.",N1
くなかった,い-Adjective,adj-na,"Was not, Wasn't (Adjective)","In order to create the negative past form of い-Adjectives , we will need to use the conjugation form. The conjugation form of an い-Adjective is simply created by removing the い, and replacing it with く. く is then followed by ない (conjugated into its past form なかった ), or あります (conjugated into its past negative form ありませんでした ). The polite negative (past) form requires use of the う - Verb , ある . This is not a unique rule for the negative past, but actually the correct way that all く-form conjugations of い-Adjectives should be constructed. However, in modern Japanese, it is not considered necessary. Instead, the semi-polite form is often used. The semi-polite form is constructed by using なかった , and then simply adding です .",N5
い-,い-Adjective,exp,Describing a noun,"In Japanese, almost any type of word can be attached to the beginning of a noun to modify the meaning, or describe the qualities of that noun. However, depending on the type of word used, conjugation rules will differ slightly. For い-Adjectives , they are simply attached to the front of the noun in their standard (dictionary) form. Caution When identifying what is an い-Adjective , and what is not, remember that an い-Adjective will always have the い outside of any kanji that are in the word. However, the reverse situation with な-Adjectives always having the い in the kanji is not true 100% of the time. 面白 い - The い is outside of the kanji, so 'interesting' is almost definitely an い-Adjective . 綺麗 - The い is inside of the kanji, so 'clean' is definitely not an い-Adjective . One example of an exception as mentioned above is 嫌 い. Despite the い being outside of the kanji, 'hate' is actually a な-Adjective . Don't worry though, less than 1% of any adjective that has い on the outside of the kanji will actually be a な-Adjective !",N5
い-,い-Adjective,adj-na,い-Adjective (Predicate),"A predicate is a word that describes the topic/subject of a sentence. The Japanese equivalent of this is a 述語 , which literally means 'statement word'. As a predicate , い-Adjectives can appear by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used at the end of a sentence. When there are no other words apart from the adjective itself, it comes across similar to 'It's cute', or 'It's hot', and similar expressions in English. We just have to guess what the 'it' is from context. In many sentences, either は or が could be used to mark the word/words that the predicate is describing. However, which one sounds more natural will depend on many factors. In general, if you are specifically pointing out something as being different from other things in the same category, が will be used. In this example, が is distinguishing this specific bath as having a unique level of hotness compared to others (maybe the water system is broken and only boiling water comes out). は would sound unnatural in this type of sentence, as it is not the 'normal' state of the bath. Fun Fact All い-Adjectives are words of Japanese origin.",N5
い-,い-Adjectives,adj-na,Adjectives ending in い,"In Japanese, い-Adjectives are known as 'form containing words', and are used to describe nouns. All い-Adjectives end in い in their base form. As mentioned, all い-Adjectives end in い in their base form. However, not all words ending in い are い-Adjectives . Let's take a look at some of the words that are commonly mistaken for い-Adjectives . In addition to きらい above, there is also きれい. きれい actually comes from the kanji structure 綺麗 , with い being part of the kanji itself. This is never the case with い-Adjectives , where the い will always be outside of the kanji. Due to the kanji for 綺麗 being somewhat difficult, this word is often written in hiragana or katakana, which leads to confusion for learners. Unfortunately there is no rule for distinguishing which words ending in い are not い-Adjectives , but thankfully, there are not very many of them, so it won't be long before you become familiar with them. Caution Unlike な-Adjectives , い-Adjectives must never be followed by だ . This is due to だ only being able to conjugate with nouns (which な-Adjectives originally are). Instead, です is used with い-Adjectives to make them sound more polite. Fun Fact Although using です with い-Adjectives is very common, it is actually incorrect Japanese. As です is simply a polite variation of だ , it follows all of the same conjugation rules as だ . This means that it should only be attached to nouns and な-Adjectives . However, as most Japanese natives do not know this rule, it is widely considered natural to use.",N5
内に,うちに,,"While, During","When うち, (sometimes seen using the kanji 内 , or 裡 ) is paired with the case marking particle に , it expresses a period/space 'within' which something else will/should happen/exist. It quite often (but not always) carries the nuance of (A) being the 'best', or the 'optimal' time/space within which (B) could occur/exist. In English, うちに can simply be translated as 'while', or 'during'. うちに may be paired with the dictionary or ている form of verbs, the plain form of い-Adjectives , nouns followed by の, or な-Adjectives that are followed by な. Unlike 間 に , うちに expresses something that can happen/exist anywhere 'within' the span of (A), and is therefore non-specific as to where (B) is located. Fun Fact The kanji 裡 refers literally to the inner walls/lining of something, and anything that is enclosed within that space. This can be thought of as where the 'non-specificity' of うち comes from, in regard to where within that space something is.",N3
う-,う-Verb,v-unspec,う - Verbs (Negative-past tense),"In order to make the negative past form of う-Verbs , you will need to change the last kana of the verb into the あ sound kana from the same column (or わ if the original kana was う). After this, the あ sound kana will be followed by ない (or ます), conjugated into their past forms. This will either be なかった (casual), or ませんでした (polite). For the ませんでした (polite) form, rather than the final kana changing to the あ sound kana from the same column, it will change to the い sound kana from the same column. The negative past form is used to convey that something 'did not happen', or 'was not'. A semi-polite form may also be used. This is constructed by using なかった , and then simply adding です . This form is not grammatically correct, but is so common that most sources (and native speakers) would consider it correct. ある is an exception to the regular conjugation rules of う-Verbs . The casual past-negative is not あらなかった, but simply なかった . However, the polite past-negative form conjugates in the same way as would be expected for う-Verbs. ありませんでした .",N5
う-,う-Verb,v-unspec,う - Verbs (Past tense),"To make the past form of a う-Verb in Japanese, just like all other conjugations of う-Verbs , you will need to change the last kana, before adding the auxiliary verb た (casual), or ました (polite). This change in kana is a bit different to other conjugations of う-Verbs , so let's take a look at them for the casual form. As can be seen in these examples, the changes consist of った, いた, いだ, んだ, した (the same as the changes for て form , but using た instead). For the conjugations using だ in place of た, this is simply a sound change in the language that happened over the course of history, to make words easier/smoother to say. It is not the auxiliary verb だ . For the polite past form of う-Verbs , the change in sound is far more consistent. This only requires a change from the う sound, to the い sound within the same column (from う to い, or from く to き, for example). When た is added to verbs (or any other word), it can have one of three possible meanings. Past: 過去 - Happened at some point in the past. (Did/Was) Completion: 完了 - An action that has finished 'happening'. (Done) Continuation: 存続 - A new state of something that is continuing. (Has been done) Caution With う-Verbs , there are a few verbs that are exceptions to the regular conjugation rules. Please check the structure guide for these.",N5
う-,う-Verb,v-unspec,う + ます (Godan Verbs),"う-Verbs include all of the verbs in Japanese that end in う sounds (including some of the verbs that end in る). These verbs are called Godan ( 五段 ) 'five-level' verbs in Japanese, due to their conjugations using all 5 of the different sounds in the same column ( 段 ) that their base form comes from. As we can see here, the く in 聞 く changes to き when conjugated to the polite form. All of the other sounds the K-column will be used with 聞 く, depending on the conjugation. This is the same for all of the う-Verbs. 聞 （か） ない, 聞 （き） たい , 聞 （く） , 聞 （け）る , 聞 （こ）う Here we can see the う-Verb 聞 く using all of the different K-column sounds in various conjugations. Caution Just like with る-Verbs , the base form of the verb may be called 'plain form', 'casual form', or 'short form', depending on the source/book.",N5
う-,う-Verb,v-unspec,Will/Does/Do (not),"The negative form of う-Verbs are conjugated based on the same set of rules used for other forms of う-Verb conjugation (changing the last kana, followed by the addition of something else). In the case of negation, the additional component will be ない (casual), or ません (polite). As can be seen here, the kana change differs depending on whether ない or ません is being used. If ない will be used, the last kana will always change from the kana ending with a う sound, to the kana ending with an あ sound within the same row. If ません will be used, the change will be from the う sound kana to the い sound kana. The only exception to this rule are verbs that end in the kana う. Instead of changing to あ (the あ sound kana in the same row), う will become わ, when used with ない . While the common translation of ない and ません is simply 'not', they actually have several possible nuances. These nuances are 'don't' (usually not), 'won't' (intentionally not), or 'can't' (unintentionally not). Both ない and ません are auxiliary verbs (ません is a conjugation of ます), meaning that they have their own set of conjugation rules. Caution The ない attached to make the negative form of adjectives is a different word, and therefore follows different conjugation rules. The ない attached to adjectives is an い-Adjective itself, and not an auxiliary verb .",N5
おおよそ,おおよそ,,"Approximately, Roughly, About","およそ or おおよそ, alternatively written as either 凡 そ or 大凡 is an adverb that commonly translates as 'approximately' or 'roughly' in English. It is primarily used in slightly more formal contexts, and can frequently be heard over announcements. As おおよそ is an adverb that is used in relation to time or distance more than anything else, it will usually be positioned at the beginning of sentences. Fun-fact The kanji 凡 itself has the meaning of 'commonplace' and may also be translated as 'as a rule'. This just indicates that (A) is something that largely applies, but is not the case 100% of the time.",N2
お陰で,おかげで,,"Thanks to, Because of","おかげで (or お 陰 で in kanji) is an expression that is used to show thanks or appreciation in Japanese. It is usually translated simply as 'thanks to (A)', or 'because of (A)'. おかげで is a combination of the polite prefix お, the noun 陰 'shade', and the case marking particle で. おかげで can be used after any word in its attributive form . Literally, お 陰 で means 'in the shade of (A)'. This implies that (B) was only made possible due to (A) creating the ideal situation for it to occur. Caution おかげで may sometimes be used sarcastically, in the same way as 'thanks to (A)' in English. In these sentences, it is usually quite clear from the context/tone of voice that the actual meaning is negative. Fun Fact おかげで is often used at the beginning of a sentence in the same way as 'thankfully' or 'luckily' in English. This just means that whatever comes after おかげで happened, despite negative outcomes also being possible.",N3
置きに,おきに,,"Repeated at intervals, Every other, Every, At intervals of","置 きに  is  a combination of 置 き, a suffix meaning 'opening' or 'interval', and the case marking particle に. Primarily written without kanji, it is an expression used to show that something happens 'every (A)', or 'at intervals of (A)'. The difference between something being interpreted as 'every', or 'at intervals of' can be tricky though, so we'll look at both. Due to おきに being a suffix , it will be attached to the end of numbers, counters, or any 'space' that it is highlighting as being an 'opening' or 'interval'. Looking at these sentences, we can see that the 'interval' is a bit difficult to understand even in English. However, the easier way to think of おきに in this sense is 'leaving a space of (A), (B)'. So if we say 'leaving a space of two days, (B)', it becomes a bit clearer that something is happening during the third day. Caution It is very common to get ごとに and おきに mixed up. The former literally means 'every'. However, the latter having the meaning of 'at intervals' makes things confusing. おきに itself will only mean 'every' sometimes. Let's look at some examples of when these two expressions overlap in meaning, and when they do not. Large time frames or distances - Only ごとに will be used to express 'every'. It makes sense to ask 'at what point' during a day, a week, or a month. Due to this, only おきに will mean 'after the interval of (A)', while ごとに means 'every'. Small time frames or distances - Both ごとに and おきに may be used to express 'every'. It doesn't make sense to care about 'at what point' during seconds, minutes, or hours. Here, because おきに points at the interval, it will mean 'every interval of one second' etc, because nobody is going to ask 'when did (B) happen during the next second', so the space is just assumed to be 'one second'. In summary, おきに will mean 'every (A)' for seconds, minutes, hours, millimeters, centimeters, and kilometers. But it will mean 'with spaces of' for almost anything bigger than that. This is not an exception to the rule, it is just a change of focus as spaces get larger. We can just remember that おきに always has one job. It highlights that (B) occurs after or outside of (A). While ごとに highlights (B) happening within (A). 一秒 おきに - The space is 'one second', so if おきに points to the beginning of the next second, the space is still only 'one second'. Because おきに doesn't care about where (B) happens within that next second, we assume straight away. 五年 おきに - The space is 'five years', so if おきに points to the beginning of the next year, the space becomes 'six years', because we are going to want to know where (B) happens within that next year. It would be strange to assume someone is waiting for New Year of the sixth year to do something instantly. Fun Fact This is a topic that native speakers frequently get wrong themselves, so don't worry if it takes a while to understand! If you are unsure about which one to use, think of 置 きに as 'leaving intervals of (A), (B)' for most purposes. 一時間 tends to be the upper limit of time that most people disagree about whether the meaning is 'every hour', or 'every second hour'. This makes sense, as the time frame is short, but still sort of long, so whether someone takes it as the beginning of the hour or some point during that hour being the important information, their opinions may differ. Remember though, おきに itself only ever points to the beginning of the space after (A), it doesn't care when/where (B) happens afterward.",N3
恐らく,おそらく,,"Probably, Perhaps, (Most) likely, (I) fear that","恐 らく is an adverb which originally stems from the conjugation of the yodan verb, 恐 る 'to fear'. In most cases, 恐 らく is simply used as a formal way to say 'probably', or 'perhaps', and is usually partnered with other structures of conjecture such as だろう, かもしれない, etc. As 恐 らく behaves adverbially, it will most often appear at the beginning of sentences before a statement of conjecture is made. Although 恐 らく can, and often does, carry the meaning of 'I fear that (A)', it isn't necessarily always used in relation to negative things. In the case of this particular grammar pattern, the main nuance that 'I fear that (A)' conveys is modesty on behalf of the speaker in that they fear their assumption may be right, given the available information. Fun-fact Yodan, or 四段活用 verbs are a type of classical-Japanese verb that have primarily been replaced by godan (う-Verbs) in modern day Japanese.",N2
お負けに,おまけに,,"In addition, On top of that, What is more, To make matters worse","お 負 けに is a phrase which often functions as a conjunction between the (A) and (B) parts of a sentence in order to show that (B) is 'in addition to (A)'. This structure stems from the common use of the noun お 負 け which indicates a 'discount' or 'freebie' that is added in addition to the base of (A). Despite お 負 け itself primarily being used for positive things お 負 けに may convey 'in addition', 'on top of that', or 'what's more' regardless of whether the original topic is a good thing or not. However, (A) and (B) will always either be both good things, or both bad things, never a mixture of both. Being a combination of お 負 け and に, this phrase will appear either at the beginning of a new sentence, or at the beginning of a second clause of a 2-part sentence. Fun-fact An important distinction between phrases like それに and お 負 けに is that お 負 けに keeps its original meaning of (B) being some kind of 'bonus'. What this means is that whatever the speaker is trying to convey, (A) by itself is enough to meet some specific qualifications, and (B) is just adding 'insult to injury', or 'icing on the cake', depending on whether it is a good or a bad thing.",N2
及び,および,,"And, As well as","及 び is a word that functions as a conjunction meaning 'and' or 'as well as', but is originally the conjunctive form of 及 ぶ, an う-Verb meaning 'to reach (A)', or 'to extend to (A)'. Although it is frequently translated simply as 'and', 及 び is a grammar pattern that more literally reflects the meaning of the base verb 'to extend to (A)'. Being a conjunction, 及 び will primarily appear at the beginning of a second clause of a sentence, or directly following a noun that something else is 'in addition to'. As 及 び is considered a formal structure, it will primarily appear in documents, articles, and notifications.",N2
終わる,おわる,,"To finish, To end","To express that actions are beginning, or ending in Japanese, the verbs 始 める (to commence), or 終 わる (to end) will need to be used. In this lesson, we will focus on actions that are 'ending'. To say that (A) is ending/finishing, we will need to attach おわる to the ます stem of almost any verb. Whether you use the hiragana form, or the kanji form does not matter, as there will be no change in nuance. Due to おわる being a verb itself, the tense can be changed to show that something will end, is ending, or has ended. Caution Unlike はじめる , which uses the transitive form, 終 わる uses the intransitive form of its transitive/intransitive pair. This is due to most actions in Japanese being considered to be things that 'come to an end' naturally (intransitive), rather than forcefully (transitive). However, there are exceptions to this, and 終 える (the transitive version) may also be seen used as an auxiliary to other verbs.",N4
お～ください,お～ください,,Please do (Honorific),"お～ください is an honorific language expression in Japanese which is used in a similar way to なさい .  It is the imperative form of くださる, which itself is the honorific language equivalent of くれる . In this way, it conveys 'please do (A) for me'. お～ください is more polite than なさい , and may be used when making requests to almost anybody, regardless of if they are higher, or lower status than you). Caution ご～ください will only be used as part of the humble speech expression, ご～する (or お〜する ). In these cases, it becomes ご～してください .",N4
お〜する,お〜する,,"I humbly do, I am obliged to do, Humble speech","お〜する comes from a form of polite speech in Japanese called humble speech . This type of speech is used to refer to the speaker and their actions. This is opposed to honorific language , which refers exclusively to the listener and their actions. お〜する is almost exactly the same as お～になる , as in it simply means する . お〜する is regularly used with words of Japanese origin, while ご～する will be used with words of Chinese origin. The する in this compound will attach directly to the ます stem of almost any verb. Caution While the する in this structure will attach directly to the ます stem of verbs, this does not mean that verbs that are already する verbs will become しする. In the case of する verbs, simply change the prefix to ご. In rare cases, お may be used instead of ご, when attached to words of Chinese origin. There is no specific rule for this, and they must be memorized on a case by case basis. Thankfully, the words of Chinese origin that use お instead of ご are extremely common verbs. This means that you will be exposed to almost all of them very quickly. All others may be assumed to use ご. Fun Fact In the same way that お～になる is a more common variation of なさる (both honorific language ), お〜する is a more common variation of いたす (both humble speech ).",N4
お～になる,お～になる,,To do (Honorific),"お～になる (or ご～になる ) is an honorific language expression which is used to pay respect to the actions of the person that is being spoken to/another person (never the speaker). In this expression, になる is used in exactly the same way that する would be, except that it will be attached to the ます stem of the verb that it is referring to. The primary difference between お and ご, is that お will be used with words/readings of Japanese origin (kun-yomi), and ご will be used with words/readings of Chinese origin (on-yomi). In fact, お and ご are both represented by the same kanji. For this kanji, 御 is one of the kun-yomi, and 御 is one of the on-yomi. Fun Fact Some verbs, like いでる, are used almost exclusively with honorific language . おいでになる (the お～になる form of いでる) is an example of this, and can mean 'to come', 'to go', or 'to be'. This is due to the perspective of the speaker when using honorific language , and something that we will discuss in more detail later.",N4
お～願う,お～願う,,"Please, Could you please","お～ 願 う is a humble speech expression in Japanese used for making requests in the same way as お～ください 'please do (A)'. As with many other polite structures, the use of お will primarily appear with words of Japanese origin, while ご will be used for the majority Chinese-origin kanji compounds. 願 う itself is a う-Verb meaning 'to petition', and the literal translation is something like 'I petition that you do (A) for me', which sounds incredibly stiff in English, but gets the point across that someone is doing a favor for you. Naturally, due to being a polite sentence pattern, お～ 願 う will almost always appear in it's ます-form, お～ 願 います . Interestingly, words of western origin, such as katakana loanwords, will often omit both お and ご , appearing simply with 願 う attached to the end. Caution As お～ 願 う is an even more polite way of saying お～ください, or simply even just てください, it will rarely be used outside of formal circumstances, such as voice-overs giving instructions etc. If used in daily speech, it may come across as sarcasm.",N2
かい,かい,,Question marker,"The sentence ending particle かい is a grammar structure that is used in Japanese to highlight a question. Despite commonly being thought of as one word, it is actually the combination of か (the sentence-ending particle) and い, another sentence-ending particle that is primarily used by men (in a similar way to ね and よ ). かい will usually be used directly after the word or phrase that it is highlighting. In the case of verbs and い-Adjectives , の may be inserted before かい . For な-Adjectives and nouns, なの may be inserted directly before it. However, の (or なの ) are frequently omitted, due to how casual かい is. When it is not omitted, の (or なの ) may be shortened to ん (or なん）. This is in the same way that の and なの would behave in the のです and なのです grammar structures. Although there are some exceptions, かい will almost always be used to ask simple yes/no questions. Caution Because かい is very casual, and quite direct, it often sounds like an accusation. Due to this, care should be taken with your tone of voice, so as not to be taken the wrong way. Fun Fact Outside of かい , the sentence ending particle い is not commonly used in modern Japanese, and therefore will only appear in a few very specific structures (like だい). Despite being similar to ね , い is considered to be fairly ぞんざい 'rough', and should only be used with people that you are very familiar with, and never to someone above you.",N4
掛け-,かけ,,"Half-, Not yet finished, About to, Begin to","Being an unofficial helper verb, かけ is what is known as a 造語 (neologism), and carries one specific meaning when used in conjunction with other words. This is  similar to 向 け . かけ comes from the verb 掛 ける 'to suspend', and may be attached to the conjunctive form or other verbs, in order to convey that they are 'unfinished'. Usually this translates as 'half (A)', 'about to (A)', or 'not yet finished (A)'. かけ behaves like a noun, so may be followed by the case marking particle の when attached directly to another noun, or by だ when at the end of a sentence. Occasionally, the verb 掛 ける itself may be used instead of the noun form, かけ . Fun Fact As the literal meaning of 掛 ける is 'to suspend', it expresses that something is stuck somewhere in the process of happening. This is similar to taking a photo of someone that is jumping. In the photo it will look like they are 'suspended', but that is only because one particular moment has been captured, somewhere between the start and the finish. かけ conveys exactly the same meaning, and therefore may be interpreted differently, depending on the verb it is paired with. With verbs that express a momentary action (something that cannot be 'half' done), かけ will convey that the action was 'on the verge of' happening. However, with verbs that are ongoing actions, かけ will simply imply that they are 'in the process' of being done.",N3
かしら,かしら,,I wonder,"Originally, かしら was an abbreviation of か 知 らぬ, or かしらん, which are both ways of expressing 'whether it's (A), I don't know'. These days, かしら is a standalone sentence ending particle that works in a similar way to かも , by expressing the speaker's uncertainty about the previous statement. かしら may be attached to the end of almost any phrase that the speaker wants to express doubt about. Caution Although the original forms of か 知 らぬ, or かしらん were useable by anybody, かしら is thought to be very feminine in modern Japanese, and therefore is not often used by men.",N4
旁,かたがた,,"Partly for (the purpose of), In addition to, Along with, By the way, And also to, Incidentally, While","旁 is a conjunction that will be seen primarily in hiragana. This word will be translated as ‘in addition to doing (A), (B)’, ‘along with (A), (B)’, or ‘incidentally to (A), (B)’. Both (A) and (B) usually have an equal level of priority, but (B) will have the nuance of ‘while (A), also (B) in passing’. かたがた will attach to the end of a noun that marks (A), while (B) will often, but not always, mark a verb of action. In cases where (A) is a noun that would usually take する, the する will be omitted entirely. Caution かたがた is a formal structure that will primarily be seen in writing, but also has a tendency to be used as a part of either apologies or thanks. Due to this, it will tend to sound unnatural if there is no special purpose for the linked actions.",N1
傍ら,かたわら,,"While, Besides, In addition to","傍 ら , seen primarily in hiragana, is a noun in Japanese that means 'bystander', in regard to something that is alongside or in the same place as the main focus. As a grammatical structure, it will be translated as 'while (A)', 'in addition to (A)', or 'besides (A)'. かたわら may come after nouns followed by の, or after the dictionary form of verbs. Something that can be remembered from the 'bystander' meaning of this word is that かたわら will always come after the primary action or state of (A), while (B) is considered to just be there incidentally to (A), or as being done secondarily to it. This usually takes the form of something like a side job or a hobby. Caution Unlike ながら, かたわら does not necessarily indicate two actions that are happening at the exact same time, just actions that are happening independently of each other with one being the focus, and the other happening to a lesser extent within the same subject's life, day to day activities, etc.",N1
方,かた,,"Way of ~ing, How to ~, Manner of ~ing","When 方 is attached to the ます stem of a verb, it carries the nuance of the 'way of doing (A)'. This is identical to 方 's standard meaning of 'way', or 'direction'. When used with する verbs, sometimes the construction 仕方 is seen. This has exactly the same meaning as the form without kanji, and may be thought of as meaning 'way of dealing/attending to (A)', as 仕 's original meaning is 'to attend to (A)'. In these cases, the する verb is followed by の , and then 仕方 . Fun Fact After attaching 方 to a verb, the entire expression is thought of as a noun-phrase. This means that it can be followed by particles such as は , を , and others, to create longer sentences.",N4
かと言うと,～かというと,,"Why? Well..., Why? Because..., If you ask me why..., The reason why is..., It is because...","～かというと is a phrase that has two primary functions. The first is used in conjunction with 'why' and 'how' words, like どうして or なぜ, while the other is used with 'who', 'when', 'where', and 'what'. We will focus on the former in this lesson. かというと is a combination of the case marking particle か in its use as a question marker, the case marking particle と in its citation use, the う - Verb 言 う 'to say', and the case marking particle と in its result use. This is quite a few particles combined together, but the literal meaning is more simply 'if (A) were to be asked', before the speaker will go on to highlight their reasoning in (B). As ～かというと will come before some sort of explanation, から will also regularly be used at the end of the sentence as 'because', emphasizing the speaker's reasoning. Caution Like other grammar points that utilize the 'if' nuance of と , ば , and sometimes even たら may be used. However, たら will appear far less frequently than と or ば .",N3
かと言うと,～かというと,,"If you ask me..., If I had to say, If I were to say, If I were to choose one, I'd rather","～かというと is a phrase that has two primary functions. The first is used in conjunction with 'why' and 'how' words, while the other is used with 'who', 'when', 'where', 'which' or 'what'. We will focus on the latter in this lesson. かというと is a combination of the case marking particle か in its use as a question marker, the case marking particle と in its citation use, the う - Verb 言 う 'to say', and the case marking particle と in its result use. This is quite a few particles combined together, but the literal meaning is more simply 'if (A) were to be asked', before the speaker will go on to highlight their reasoning in (B). 何 で, 何 , どちら, 誰 , どの, and similar words often appear as the 'who', 'where', or 'which' words in these sentences. As ～かというと will come before some sort of explanation, から will also regularly be used at the end of the sentence as 'because', emphasizing the speaker's reasoning. Caution Like other grammar points that utilize the 'if' nuance of と , ば , and sometimes even たら may be used. However, たら will appear far less frequently than と or ば .",N3
かと思うと,かと思ったら・かと思うと,,"Then again, Just when I thought, No sooner than","When the adverbial particle か is combined with と, the う-Verb 思 う, and either of the hypothetical markers たら or と, it forms a compound that is used to illustrate uncertainty about whether (A) has been finalized or not. In most cases, this translates as '(A), then again (B)', 'just when I thought (A), (B)', or 'no sooner than (A), (B)'. Literally, the meaning is close to 'before (A) could even be confirmed as having happened, (B)'. かと 思 うと and かと 思 ったら will regularly appear after verbs in either their dictionary or past-tense forms. Alternatively, this structure may also be seen following nouns, especially when the meaning is focused on the speaker's feelings about (A). Either なの (or の when used with verbs) may appear between the target phrase and かと 思 ったら when the (B) phrase includes the speaker's feelings. Caution - Occasionally, か may be omitted from this phrase, leaving only と 思 うと and と 思 ったら . Although the meaning is exactly the same, omission of the か will make the expression sound softer.",N2
かどうか,かどうか,,"Whether or not, If...or not","かどうか is an expression in Japanese which combines the 'or' meaning of か , with the 'how' meaning of どう. (A) かどうか (B) is regularly translated as 'whether or not (A), (B)'. To use かどうか , simply attach it to the end of any phrase that you want to express the 'or' use of か about, then add the (B) phrase. Although 'whether or not' is the standard translation, the more literal translation of かどうか is 'if it's (A), or however it is, (B)'.",N4
かなり,かなり,,"Quite, Considerably, Pretty, Fairly","かなり is an adverb that is used to convey a 'considerable' amount of something. It is often translated as 'quite', 'fairly', 'considerably', or 'pretty'. かなり will almost always appear directly before a phrase, or directly before a noun (in which case の will come between the noun and かなり). Fun Fact かなり originally came from 可也 , and more recently 可成 . Both of these expressions mean something similar to 'to become undeniable', with the former structure using an older kanji for 'to become' 也 . かなり is still used this way today, highlighting that the amount/existence of something has reached a point that cannot be denied. かなり may be seen with this meaning when carrying either positive and negative connotations.",N3
かな,かな,,I wonder,"Originally a mixture of the sentence ending particles か , and な, かな evolved over time to become its own (singular) sentence ending particle, which roughly translates as 'I wonder if (A)?'. As it is a sentence ending particle , かな can be added to the end of almost any sentence. Combining the meanings か and な, we can see where かな gets its original meaning. か presents questions (usually to other people), while な shows that a statement is related purely to the speaker's own thoughts/opinions. In this way, かな expresses that the speaker's own thoughts are being questioned. Fun Fact In the past, かな was thought of as being a fairly feminine way to express 'I wonder', and males tended to use phrases like だろうか to express the same type of statement. However, in modern day Japanese, かな is used by both men and women equally.",N4
兼ねない,かねない,,"Might, Could be, Capable of, Possible","The negative form of the る-Verb 兼 ねる 'to spread across' (usually 2 different activities or thought processes) is a grammar pattern that indicates a possibility of (A) happening, especially when it is something that the speaker themselves cannot control. 兼 ねない is often translated as 'might (A)', 'capable of (A)', or '(A) is a possibility'. This structure will be seen connected to the ます-stem of verbs, or after nouns followed by に. Both the kanji and non-kanji forms may be used. It is quite common to see 兼 ねない come after conditional phrases that include と, ば, たら, でも, and similar structures. This indicates that 'if (A) were to happen, (B) may also occur'. Caution While this grammar structure is most often used to highlight negative outcomes, it may also be used to indicate or desire or wish sarcastically. Fun-fact As 兼 ねる means 'to spread across', in the negative, this expression can be thought of as similar to 'to not be a stretch' in English. It just indicates the action of (A) would not be a stretch of the ability or capacity of whoever or whatever is being discussed.",N2
兼ねる,かねる,,"Cannot, Be unable to, Hard to, Hesitant to","兼 ねる , a る-Verb meaning 'to spread across' (usually 2 different activities or thought processes), often follows the ます-stem of other verbs in order to highlight that '(A) is not possible'. However, 兼 ねる often indicates that the speaker would actually like to do (A), but cannot due to some external circumstances such as difficulty, already being busy, being hesitant, etc. This particular grammar pattern will most frequently be seen in its non-kanji form, although both are possible. 兼 ねる is somewhat formal, and may be used in cases where a phrase like できない would be considered too strong, so the speaker wants to lightly imply that (A) cannot be done. Fun-fact As 兼 ねる means 'to spread across', this expression can be thought of as similar to 'to be a stretch' in English. It just indicates that doing the action of (A) would be a stretch of the speaker's ability or capacity.",N2
かの様だ,かのようだ,,"As if, Just like","かのようだ is a set phrase in Japanese indicating that something 'appears to be (A)', but the speaker is not certain. It will be translated as 'as if (A)', or 'just like (A)'. This is a combination of the adverbial particle か, の and the auxiliary verb 様 だ 'appearing to be'. The more literal meaning can be thought of as 'is it not like (A)?', due to the uncertainty expressed by か. かのようだ may follow verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns followed by である. When ようだ is altering the meaning of a verb or a noun later in the sentence, ように or ような may also be used. This grammar construction will often be seen with expressions that emphasize the speaker's assumption about (A), such as まるで. If compared to English, this merely strengthens the sentence in a similar way to the difference between 'it's as if (A)', and 'it's just as if (A)'.",N2
かは〜によって違う,〜かは〜によって違う,,"Depends on, Changes depending on, Differ depending on","～かは～ によって 違 う is an expression in Japanese that appears quite complex at first, but is actually quite simple when broken down into its parts. かは is a combination of the case marking particle か in its role as a quotation, paired with the adverbial particle は, highlighting the topic of the sentence. Together these can be translated as 'whether (A)'. によって 違 う is made up of the case marking particle に (highlighting a location), the て form of よる (a う - Verb), followed by 違 う 'to differ', (another う - Verb). All together, this can be translated as '(A) depends on (B)'. More accurately though, the meaning is 'whether (A) will differ depending on (B)'. かは is regularly used after an entire phrase, followed by a noun and then によって 違 う . Alternatively, かどうか may be used instead of かは. This changes the nuance from 'whether (A)', to 'whether or not (A)'. When translated directly, かどうか is quite similar to 'whether (A) or however'. Finally, this expression may also be seen without 違 う. In a sentence like this, 'differs' is simply removed, becoming 'whether (A) will depend on (B)'. As conjugation between the verbs is no longer required, によって will become による .",N3
かもしれない,かもしれない,,"Might, Maybe, Probably","かもしれない is an expression in Japanese that is often treated as a single word, but is actually the combination of the particle かも , and the potential form of the う-Verb 知 る (to know) with the auxiliary verb ない attached. かもしれない is regularly translated simply as 'might', or 'maybe', but the literal translation is much closer to 'even (A), we cannot know'. To use かもしれない , attach it to the end of any verb, noun, な-Adjective or い-Adjective , in their non-polite (keigo) forms. As the う-Verb 知 る is part of this construction, it may also be altered to its polite- potential form, creating かもしれません . Due to かもしれない being such a common grammar pattern in daily speech for expressing uncertainty about various things, several colloquial forms also exist. These are かも , かもしらん , and かもしれん . かも is by far the most common of these colloquial forms, with かもしらん potentially sounding a little bit rough/boyish.",N4
からある,からある,,"As much as, As many as, At least","Like からする, a structure showing that something 'goes from (A)', からある works in a similar way, but simply shows that something 'exists from (A)'. This grammar pattern will be used when making an estimation where the minimum is being guessed. からある is a combination of the case-marking particle から 'from', and the う-Verb ある 'to be'. からある will appear after numbers and counters. からある has a tendency to appear most frequently when describing things that are thought to be static, such as distances, sizes, or weights. Caution Following the standard rules of いる and ある, いる will need to be used if something living is being counted. However, this is not a common use of this grammar structure, with からの almost always being used in place of からいる for counting living things.",N1
からこそ,からこそ,,"Emphasized because, Precisely because","Traditionally, the adverbial particle こそ is used to emphasize whatever noun (or noun phrase) it is attached to. However, when combined with the conjunction particle から, it focuses on emphasizing the 'reason' for something. This structure is very similar to phrases like 'precisely because (A)' in English. からこそ is an expression that is primarily used after either verbs or nouns. In the case of nouns, the noun will need to be followed by the auxiliary verb だ , before からこそ is added. With からこそ, there may be several reasons for why something is the way it is, but こそ will show that there is a 'foremost' reason that should be considered before anything else.",N3
からして...,からして,,"Even..., Judging from, Based on","からして is a combination of the conjunction particle から 'from', and the て-form of する. It is used to express when the speaker is making a partially objective opinion about (A). This frequently comes across as 'judging from (A)', or 'based on (A)'. The literal meaning is 'going from (A), (B)'. This simply highlights that (A) is the only information or method available from which an assessment can be made, so 'going from that information, (B) can be said', or 'going with that method, (B) can be said'. からして will appear directly after the noun which indicates either the method or information from which a judgment will then be made. As からして is partially objective, this just means that the speaker does not have the full information available to say anything with certainty, and is therefore making a guess about (A) based purely on what appears to be true. Due to this, からして sentences often have the nuance of 'from the available piece of information about (A), (B) is likely the whole picture'.",N2
からすると,からすると・からすれば,,"Judging from, Considering","からすると is an expression combining the conjunction particle から 'from', する 'to do', and either of the hypothetical markers と or ば. It may be translated as 'judging from (A), (B)', or 'considering (A), (B)'. However, the way that する behaves in these types of sentences is quite comparable to expressions like 'going off' in English, in that it just indicates that (A) is the basis from which the speaker is about to make their judgment. からすると or からすれば will be seen following nouns, before the (B) part of the sentence will highlight the speaker's assessment of (A). Fun-fact In almost all cases that する is paired with a hypothetical structure like と, ば, or たら, it indicates that the speaker is 'going with' the assumption of (A) being true, before further expressing what applies based on that assumption.",N2
からする,からする,,"About, Or more, Over, Starts at","からする is a slightly formal grammar pattern in Japanese that appears after some kind of number or counter in order to indicate a minimum from which an estimation is being made. It will generally be translated as 'about (A)', '(A) or more', or 'starting at (A)'. This structure is a combination of the case-marking particle から, and the special verb する. It has quite a literal meaning in that a number is 'going from (A)', where (A) is the start point and the speaker doesn't know the exact amount. In addition to からする , からの may be used with the same meaning. However, unlike する, because の must attach directly to a second noun, からの is a bit more limited in the way it will be used. Caution Due to からする being used for giving an estimation, it has a tendency to only appear when the number or amount of something is quite large, and the speaker is emphasizing that the actual number cannot be guessed. Because of this, it may sound quite unnatural when used with small numbers. Caution からする tends to be used most frequently in regard to money, while からの will be used when referring to people and other general amounts. In the case of things like weight, size, or distance, からある , another similar structure will be used. からある will be covered in its own grammar point.",N1
からといって,からといって,,Just because,"からといって is a grammar pattern in Japanese comprised of the conjunction particle から 'from', と, and the て-form of the う-Verb 言 う 'to say'. It is usually translated to 'just because (A)', and will indicate that the underlying reason of (A) does not necessarily mean that (B) is also true, or that (B) is not good. As this grammar structure often includes a negative statement in the (B) part of the sentence, the more literal translation is closer to 'from saying that (A), doesn't mean (B)'. This simply focuses the nuance on that (A) does not equal (B), despite what one may think. からといって may appear after verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns that are followed by だ. In most cases, からといって will be used for giving strong opinions, or for criticism of someone's actions or behavior. Caution - It is not rare to see からといって abbreviated as either からとて , or からって . There is no change in meaning in either of these cases, but they are more colloquial.",N2
からには,からには,,"As long as, Since, Given","からには is an expression in Japanese that is used to indicate when something is either obvious or determined upon based on the previous information. This may translate as 'as long as (A), (B)', 'since (A), (B)', or 'given that (A), (B)'. It is a combination of から , に , and は , and literally means something like 'from within (A), (B)'. からには may follow any word in their standard forms, but occasionally also follows nouns or な-Adjectives that end with である . からには focuses mainly on the determination of the speaker that (A) is something that is the 'base' state (emphasized with には), so going from that point (emphasized with から) is either unavoidable, or the most logical. The second part of the sentence will then make some statement about that determination. This may either be a personal opinion about the situation, or what the speaker intends to do about it. Caution Sometimes, からは may be seen by itself. However, this pattern is relatively more formal, and will not usually be used in spoken language.",N2
から見ると,から見ると,,"From the point of view of, By the look of","から 見 ると is a common sentence pattern seen when something is being viewed either from the perspective of (A), or a judgment is being made based on looking at the situation of (A) objectively. This may be translated either as 'from the point of view of (A), (B)', or 'from looking at (A), one could say (B)'. This grammar construction is comprised of the conjunction particle から 'from', the る-Verb 見 る 'to look', and any of the usual hypothetical statement markers such as と, たら, ば, or even the て-form. It will appear following nouns. Caution から 見 ると tends not to be used with things that cannot actually physically be seen or assessed, such as smells, sounds, etc.",N2
から言うと,から言うと,,"Speaking in terms of, From the point of view of","からいうと (appearing with or without kanji) is a phrase in Japanese that is used to express a particular viewpoint or standpoint from which some type of evaluation, conclusion, or opinion can be drawn. The と that appears here is one of the assumption uses of this particle, meaning that から 言 えば may also be used. からいうと will always follow a noun (or noun phrase), before the (B) part of that same sentence will describe some kind of evaluation/opinion/etc. This structure closely reflects phrases like 'speaking in terms of (A), (B)', or 'what can be drawn from (A) is that (B)'. Occasonally, the use of particles such as と or ば may be skipped entirely, with から 言 って being used instead. Caution 'Name + からいうと' may not be used with this expression, as a person is not a 'situation'. However, it is perfectly ok to use something like 'name の 立場 からいうと', as this highlights a specific situation that the said person is in. Caution Due to からいうと regularly highlighting some sort of 'overall situation', it will not be used with momentary/visual things. In these cases, while not strictly incorrect, it may sound quite unnatural to a native speaker. A more appropriate choice here would be something like から 見 ると, as this can be used to make purely visual assessments.",N3
から,から,prt,"Because, Since","から can have several different meanings in Japanese, depending on which part of the sentence it is in, and what comes before/after it. It is often translated as 'because', or 'since'. In these cases, it just means 'Because of (A), (B)'. から may be used with almost any type of word, but when the nuance is 'because', it will require だ before it when following a noun or な-Adjective . Despite having several different nuances, it may be easier to think of から as meaning 'from' in all situations, as that is the base nuance. From (A as a reason), (B) = Because/Since. From (A as a location), (B) = From. Fun Fact から is a special type of particle in Japanese called a case marking particle . These are particles that describe the relationship that (A) and (B) exist in. We will learn more about these soon!",N5
から,から,prt,From,"から can have several different meanings in Japanese, depending on which part of the sentence it is in, and what comes before/after it. It is often translated as 'from'. In these cases, it just means 'with (A) as a starting location, (B)'. In this grammar construction, から comes directly after the place that is considered the starting point. This form of から is the closest to the 'base' meaning of the word in Japanese, as the nuance of から can almost always be thought of as meaning 'from' in some way. Caution This form of から does not require だ when used after nouns or な-Adjectives , as that would change the meaning to ' because '.",N5
かれ〜かれ,かれ〜かれ,,"Or, Either or","かれ～かれ is a grammar pattern that pairs with opposite い-Adjectives in Japanese to convey that 'whether (A) or (B), the result will be the same'. It is usually translated as 'or', or 'either (A) or (B)'. Originally, this structure was a contraction of the conjunctive stem of い-Adjectives, く, and the imperative form of the う-Verb ある 'to be', あれ. い-Adjectives do not have their own imperative form , so くあれ and then the abbreviation かれ evolved to fill this role. As it is imperative, the literal meaning is simply 'be it (A) or (B)', and is a declaration. かれ～かれ will attach to the stem of 2 adjectives that are antonyms, before going on to explain how the result remains the same regardless. かれ～かれ is used with a very limited set of adjectives, so it is best not to use it with words that you have not come across previously. Caution In the case of 良 い 'good' and 悪 い 'bad', 悪 い will be read as 悪 しかれ, which comes from the archaic 悪 し 'bad'. This is considered as set phrase in modern Japanese.",N1
か何か,か何か,,"Or something, Or something like that","か 何 か is a structure in Japanese used for expressing uncertainty about a specific thing. Being a construction of か, the substitute noun 何 , and か, the common translations of 'or something', and 'or something like (A)' are quite close to the more literal meaning which is just '(A), or whatever it is'. か 何 か will follow directly after the noun that it is describing as being something uncertain. か 何 か will also often be used in questions, or when offering someone something. This is primarily when more than (A) is available as a choice, but the speaker isn't specifying a list just yet. In these situations, (A) just indicates a general category to which 'or something else' would be a part of.",N2
か否か,か否か,,Whether or not,"否 'no' is an interjection in Japanese that is primarily paired with the adverbial particle か 'or' when stating 'whether or not (A)'. The literal meaning is just '(A) or no'. This is a very formal expression that will mainly be seen in writing. か 否 か may appear after almost any word in their standard forms . This structure is often paired with words like べき 'ought to', を 問 わず 'without questioning', にかかわらず 'regardless of', and will be used to make determinations about the suitability of something based on a specific situation.",N1
か〜ないかの内に,か〜ないかのうちに,,"Right after, As soon as, Just when, Barely","か～ないかのうちに is a slightly formal grammar structure used in Japanese to indicate a precise point in time where the action of (A) can not be determined as either being started, or finished. Usually, it highlights the exact moment either before or after (A) commences. This grammar structure is comprised of か, ない, か, の, the noun 内 'within', and に. Literally, it just means 'while not knowing whether (A) or not (A), (B)'. The verb that appears before か and ないか must be repeated in this grammar pattern, and may be used in its dictionary form. Standard translations include 'right after (A)', 'as soon as (A)', and 'barely when (A)'. Additionally, か～ないかのうちに may be used to highlight relatively short periods of time within which something happens. This is usually in regard to some sort of positive or negative occurrence that would not usually be expected to be able to happen so quickly.",N2
か,か,prt,Or,"One of the common uses of the particle か is often translated to 'or' in English. While this translation is accurate, it is not actually any different from か 's regular usage as a question marker. From these examples, we can see that, in Japanese, か is performing the same role that a question mark would, or that a change in tone of voice would in spoken language. 'Would you like tea? coffee?' (said with a rising tone). This nuance of か can be used after the dictionary form of almost any word in Japanese. However, using です or ます will change the nuance from 'presenting possibilities', to 'asking a formal question', so should be avoided.",N5
か,か,prt,Question marking particle,"か is a particle that frequently comes at the end of sentences in Japanese, and carries the same meaning as a question mark in English. (It is not limited to appearing at the end of sentences, however). In addition to questions, か can also express uncertainty about something, without strictly being a question. か regularly comes after the polite form of words, such as ～ です か , ～ます か . However, in casual conversation, か can be used directly after the word that the speaker is showing uncertainty about. Both examples are grammatically correct, but the sentence without です may be considered rude by some people (as it sounds too familiar/direct).",N5
がある,がある,exp,"Noun (B) that has Noun (A), Noun (B) with Noun (A)","In this expression, がある has the role of describing the noun that follows it. The description that it is giving is '(A) がある (B)' = '(B) has/with (A)'. This type of phrase is called a relative clause (something that describes a noun), and behaves similarly to an adjective. In English, a relative clause would require a pronoun such as 'who' 誰 , 'which' どれ, 'that' それ・あれ, 'where' どこ. However, these types of words are not required in Japanese, and the noun will follow がある directly. Caution In a relative clause, because (A) is describing (B), (B) will be considered the 'main topic/subject'. This means that は will generally not be used in place of が . However, の can be used instead of が , as showing a relationship between (A) and (B) is one of the main functions of の .",N5
が有る,がある,exp,"To be, There is","がある is a common construction that is simply a combination of the が particle, and the う-Verb , ある . This expression means 'to exist', or 'there is', and is used in relation to non-living/inanimate things. Because the things being described in these examples are not considered to be 'alive', ある is the verb that will be used. いる is used for living things. The polite form of ある conjugates as あります . Due to the る changing to り, we can determine that ある is a う-Verb (Godan verb) . However, ある is irregular in that the plain negative form is ない , not あらない. The kanji form of 有 る is quite common, and should be learned as early as possible, to save any confusion while reading. There is no nuance difference between this expression being used with, or without kanji, and is up to the preference of the writer. Caution The が in がある is often omitted in casual speech, or writing that behaves like casual speech (manga, instant messaging, etc).",N5
が居る,がいる,exp,"To be, There is,  To remain (in a state)","がいる is a common construction that is simply a combination of the が particle, and the verb いる . This expression means 'to exist', or 'there is', and is used in relation to living/animate things. Because the things being described in these examples are considered to be alive (or operated by something that is alive), いる is the verb that will be used. ある is used for non-living things. The polite form of いる conjugates as います . Due to the る being removed, we can determine that いる is a る-Verb (Ichidan verb) . The kanji form of 居 る is quite common, and should be learned as early as possible to save any confusion while reading. There is no nuance difference between this expression being used with or without kanji, and is up to the preference of the writer. Caution The が in がいる is often omitted in casual speech, or writing that behaves like casual speech (manga, instant messaging, etc).",N5
掛けに,がけに,,"On the way to, As you go","Although not used much in modern Japanese, the suffix 掛 け 'support', or 'hanger' followed by に may occasionally appear after the ます-stem of verbs. When seen used this way, 掛 けに simply means 'on the way', 'as you go', or 'while doing (A)'. (B) may just be considered as something done while doing (A), or as being done specifically because (A) is a good opportunity to do it. This structure may be used either with or without kanji, so it will be important to remember both. Fun-fact 掛 ける is one of the more difficult verbs in Japanese, as it does not have an exact counterpart in English. However, in most cases it just means to lay, extend, or place something across either a physical or metaphorical surface or span. In this way, it may help to remember (A) as the span from which (B) will occur.",N2
がする,がする,,"To give off, Smell, Sound, Taste, Sensation","In Japanese, describing things that can be experienced with the senses (excluding visual), is a little bit different to the way that we would convey it in English. Traditionally, we would use unique verbs for each of these situations, such as 'smells like (A)', 'tastes like (A)', 'feels like (A)', etc. While this is still possible in Japanese, it is not the most common way. がする is a grammar construction that focuses on the source of the smell, sound, taste, or feeling, and makes the sensory experience itself the subject of the sentence. To use がする , simply attach it to the end of any phrase that expresses which type of 'sense' is being created/given off by the subject. Fun Fact Japanese often uses 気 'energy', 'spirit', as something that can be perceived with the senses. Due to this, there are many phrases which use ～ 気 がする in the same way as this grammar point.",N4
がたい,がたい,,"Hard to, Difficult to","Coming from the same kanji as 難 しい 'difficult', 難 い is a suffix that also means 'difficult'. However, in the case of がたい , it will be attached to the conjunctive form of verbs, and conveys that '(A) is difficult to do'. がたい is almost always written without kanji in this meaning. Compared to にくい , which can simply imply that something is 'uncomfortable' to do, がたい refers almost exclusively to 困難 であること 'things that involve a high degree of difficulty, distress, or infeasibility'. Due to this, がたい will come across as far stronger than にくい , and may imply that a certain task is almost impossible. Summed up, these nuances basically translate as the following: にくい - Something is difficult based on someone's opinion, experience, or general feeling. がたい - Something is difficult based on the task itself having a high level of difficulty.",N3
がち,がち,,"Apt to do, Tend to do, Prone to do","がち is a suffix in Japanese that will be used after nouns, or the conjunctive form of verbs. It conveys that someone is 'apt to (A)', 'tends to (A)', or 'is prone to (A)'. Although not always negative, がち is most frequently used to express negative tendencies. Fun Fact がち as a grammar structure comes from the word 勝 ち, meaning 'a win'. 勝 ち in itself is used to express something that appears 'repeatedly', or 'again and again'. Due to this, がち may be thought of as similar to 'to win out' in English, meaning that 'although there are many possibilities, (A) winning out is the most likely'. This 'winning out' may be due to preference, or sheer good/bad luck.",N3
がてら,がてら,,"On the occasion of, While … as well, While …  (one is) at it, During, Along the way","がてら is a neologism that is used in the same way as an adverbial particle in modern Japanese, and will connect to the conjunctive form of verbs, and to nouns. It is similar to ながら in that it will be translated as 'while (A), (B)', 'during (A), (B)', or 'on the occasion of (A)'. When (A) is a noun, it will almost always be a noun that signifies some sort of physical movement. Unlike ながら, がてら focuses more on (A) being a good opportunity which can be utilized or taken advantage of in order to do (B). Fun Fact がてら is a vocal change of がてり, which originally comes from an abbreviation of the conjunctive form of 糅 つ, かて 'to mix together', and あり. So かてあり was abbreviated to かてり, which then went through sound changes to がてり and がてら . However, the 'being mixed together' meaning is still kept in the modern day nuance of this grammar point.",N1
が必要,がひつよう,,"Need, Necessary","が 必要 is a common expression in Japanese which is used to highlight the 'need' or 'necessity' of something. It is a structure that may only be used with nouns, which means that verbs will need to be nominalized (turned into noun-phrases) in order to use this construction. Both が and だ may sometimes be omitted from this expression in casual speech. However, it is a good idea to at least use が ,   to clarify the thing that is 'necessary'.",N4
が欲しい,がほしい,,"To want something, To be in need of","To say that you want something in Japanese, the が particle will be combined with the い-Adjective 欲 しい 'to want (A)', or 'to desire (A)'. This is exactly the same way as other い-Adjectives behave when describing nouns. Caution This use of 欲 しい is only used for saying that you want 'things' (nouns). The auxiliary verb たい will be used when saying that you want to 'do' something (verbs). However, ほしい may be used with verbs to express that you want another person to do something. This is done through the use of ほしい after the conjunction particle, て . For more detail about this, please see our てほしい lesson.",N4
が見られる,がみられる,,"Can see, Can be seen, Can observe, Can be observed, Be evident, Chance to see something","Unlike 見 える 'to be visible', which focuses on whether something can be seen or not, 見 られる (the potential form of 見 る) focuses on the viewer's physical ability to see something. Due to this が 見 られる is used to highlight things that require some form of 'effort' to see, like 'changes', 'trends', etc. As a result of the 'effort' that is required, が 見 られる is often translated as 'for (A) to be evident', 'it can be observed that (A)', 'it can be seen that (A)', and other similar structures. To use 見 られる , simply add it after the noun that you would like to show as being 'evident'. As られる is both the potential and passive form of 見 る, it may be interpreted either way. However, in the case of ラ 抜 き 言葉 (ら removed verbs), only 可能 (possibility) may be expressed, not 受 け 身 (passivity).",N4
がる,がる,,"To feel, To think, To act as if, To want, To desire","がる is a う-Verb that is primarily used as a suffix in Japanese. When used in this way, it means 'to act like (A)', or 'to show signs of being (A)', where (A) is the word that it is attached to. To use がる , you will need to link it to the stem form of an い-Adjective (simply remove the い), or to the stem form of a な-Adjective (do not include the な). がる is a verb which means 'to give the impression of (A)', or 'to act like (A)'. This is very important in Japanese, as you would not usually say how somebody else feels, unless they told you directly and you are simply repeating what you heard (in which case you would use the quotation particle と ). When you want to express the way you 'think' that someone else feels, but don't have any direct information about it, that is when がる would be natural to use. For example, if you see someone shivering in the cold, you would say something like the following. The main difference between がる , and がっている , is that がる will be used when a person usually/always acts a certain way, whereas がっている is more about the way someone/something is acting in any specific moment. Caution がる may also be used to describe yourself (in the third person). This is when you want to express the way you think that you act/are acting, or a way you assume other people view your behavior. Fun Fact The use of がっている to express an 'in the moment' way that someone is acting, is slowly becoming less and less common in modern Japanese. Regularly, そう will be used instead, to express that someone (or something) 'seems' a certain way.",N4
が早いか,が早いか,,"As soon as, No sooner than, The instant that, No sooner had","が 早 いか is an expression in Japanese that groups with verbs, for the purpose of indicating an action which is immediately followed by a second, often unexpected action. It is a combination of the case-marking particle が, the い-Adjective 早 い 'soon', and the adverbial particle か. It is often translated as 'no sooner than (A), (B)', or 'the instant that (A), (B)'. The more literal translation, taking into account the use of か, is '(A), or possibly sooner, (B)'. This just illustrates the instantaneousness of the (B) action in that (A) was unable to be determined as actually completed before (B) started. This grammar pattern is formal, and will follow verbs in their dictionary or past tense forms. The verb that comes in the (B) phrase will always be in the past tense. (A) will tend to be actions that happen momentarily, or having a clearly defined finish point. For actions that don't have a clearly defined finish point, 終 わる 'to finish' will often be linked to the stem form, in order to specify the end. Additionally, while the (B) action will often be unexpected, it will also usually be volitional, that is to say something done intentionally. Caution Due to が 早 いか always expressing something in the past, it cannot be used to express wishes or intentions for the future. Additionally, it will not highlight the speaker's own actions.",N1
が気になる,が気になる,,"To be interested in, To be concerned about","One of the many collocations in Japanese based on 気 'attention', or 'focus', is 気 になる. This is just a combination of the noun 気 , に, and the う-Verb なる 'to become'. Also, 気になる will come after (A) が, where (A) marks the thing that is drawing the 'attention' or 'focus' of the speaker. The most common translations for this structure are 'to be interested in (A)', or 'to be concerned about (A)'. This grammar pattern will appear before nouns, and noun-like phrases. Caution Unlike 気 にする, which implies more that the speaker in intentionally putting their 'focus' on (A) due to it being difficult to ignore, the use of なる just highlights that (A) is 'becoming' something that is being focused on naturally, due to either the speakers concern or interest in the result.",N2
が,が,prt,"But, However","As a particle, が has several different uses in Japanese. However, each of these different uses share a common theme. That theme expresses 'highlighting (A) as important, (B)'. In this use, が comes across as 'but', or 'however' in English. This nuance of が is used directly after any form of verb or い-Adjective , but requires one of the conjugations of だ or です before it when used with a noun or な-Adjective . From these examples, we can see that が is simply highlighting that 'while (A) is important, there is extra information'. が with the meaning of 'but' is considered to be very formal, this is due to it sounding quite direct in asserting that there is extra information. Caution Sometimes a statement will end with が . In these cases it just means that more information exists, but it is obvious, so it does not need to be said.",N5
が,が,prt,"Subject marking particle, Identification particle","が is considered to be the subject marker in Japanese. This means that it marks someone or something that is performing an action, or it identifies someone or something as having a specific feature (this is usually a feature that the listener is not aware of). In both of these sentences, が puts focus on the thing performing an action/existing in some way (as opposed to any other thing). Because of this, が is usually said to highlight what comes before it, while は highlights what comes after it. が always shows the 'target' of a statement, when other targets also exist. This is why が is used to describe situations that are happening either 'in the moment', or 'individually of other things'. Because the group in this sentence is only one group out of many possible 'groups of people' that could be described, が will be used. Caution が is not usually used to describe something about yourself, unless you are intentionally describing yourself compared to other people. If you want to talk about yourself 'in general terms', は will sound more natural (there are exceptions).",N5
切っ掛け,きっかけ,,"Lead to, Because of, As a start or trigger of, An opportunity","きっかけ 'chance', or 切 っ 掛 け in its kanji form is a noun in Japanese that expresses when the trigger of (A) led to (B). It is often translated simply as 'because of (A), (B)', 'with (A) as a trigger, (B)', or 'with the opportunity of (A), (B)'. きっかけ primarily appears in two different forms. (A) をきっかけに (B), or (A) がきっかけで (B). This grammar pattern may be seen either with verbs in their past-tense form or nouns. However, in the case of appearing after verbs, it will often be preceded by の or some other nominalizing structure like こと. In many cases, the trigger of (A) will have the effect of instigating a rather large change or new beginning. Caution - きっかけ will not be used when the causal relationship between (A) and (B) is plainly obvious, due to what would be expected or easy to anticipate result. Because of this, it can be thought that きっかけ is almost always referring to the opportunity of (B) appearing because of (A), with some external choice being made, or action being taken on that occasion.",N2
嫌いがある,きらいがある,,"Have a tendency to, Tend to, Be slightly~","嫌 いがある is a combination of the noun きらい 'a dislike', the case-marking particle が, and the う-Verb ある 'to be'. It is used to indicate the presence of negative tendencies or habits, and may be translated as 'to have a tendency to (A)', or 'to be prone to (A)'. This structure will be seen following the dictionary form of verbs, verbs negated with ない, or after nouns ending with の. As a more literal translation, 嫌 いがある can be thought of as 'having the displeasure of (A)', with the actual 'tendency' merely being implied. Due to 嫌 いがある being quite strong, it is frequently used together with words that will slightly soften the meaning, such as 少 し 'a little bit', or どうも 'try as one might'. Caution As 嫌 いがある will be used to describe things that are 'displeasurable' from the point of view of the speaker, it will usually not be used in relation to oneself.",N1
嫌い,きらい,n,"Dislike, Not fond of","嫌 い , meaning 'to dislike', is one of the very common な-Adjectives in Japanese that is used in many different expressions. All な-Adjectives behave similarly to verbs, in that their form changes depending on what comes after them. For 嫌 い , it will be followed by either な , when acting as an adjective, だ , or the more polite です , when acting as a noun. This distinction is made depending on whether it is linked to another noun, or is independent. In the example with だ , 嫌 い is expressing that the thing is 'dislikable' (assertion). However, in the example with な , 嫌 い is expressing 'being disliked' as a quality of the noun it is attached to. In the same way that 好 き can often be partnered with 大 to mean 'love', 嫌 い can often be partnered with 大 to mean 'hate'. Caution Despite ending in い, 嫌 い is one of the few words that is actually a な-Adjective , and needs to be memorized.",N5
きり,きり,,"Only, Just, Since","As an adverbial particle , きり may convey that 'upon (A)', where (A) is usually a verb, that action was the 'first and last time'. This is frequently translated as 'only', 'just', or 'since'. きり comes from the う - Verb 切 る 'to cut'. きり is often used after the plain past form of verbs, with nouns, or with counters. Let's look at verbs first. With verbs, きり is primarily used to show that (A) occurring was all that was required for (B). Usually, this results in some permanent consequence, or permanent change of opinion. In almost every situation, (A) is something that has only happened once, and きり can be interpreted as 'ever since'. When it comes to the use of きり with nouns or counters, it will express that something is happening with (A) as the limit 'nothing more, nothing less'. In other words, (A) is all that will be included in some particular situation/action. Caution きり may also be seen as っきり or キリ . There is no specific change in nuance, but っきり is the most common casual form.",N3
気味,ぎみ,,"Looking, Feeling a little, Touch of, Tending to, Slightly","Coming from the noun 気味 meaning 'sensation', ぎみ is a suffix that is used to convey weak signs of (A). ぎみ may be used with nouns, or the conjunctive form of verbs. Often, ぎみ is translated as 'looking (A)', 'a touch of (A)', 'feeling a little (A)', or 'slightly (A)'. ぎみ refers to the senses of the person who is experiencing them, and therefore may be used to refer to feelings about other people/things, or feelings about oneself. As ぎみ expresses 'weak signs of (A)', it is often used to soften a statement, so that the speaker does not appear overconfident. Caution Although it comes from 気味 , ぎみ will always be said with a ぎ, and not a き. This is a sound change used to distinguish the noun and the suffix .",N3
癖に,くせに,,"Even though, And yet, Despite","癖 is a noun that means 'habit' or 'tendency'. However, as it usually refers to a negative thing, 'vice' is another accurate translation. くせに (usually appearing without kanji) is the combination of くせ, and the case marking particle に. This structure is often used to criticize the actions of others, and is used in a similar way to 'despite', 'even though', or 'and yet' in English. As くせ is a noun, くせに may be used after the attributive form of any other word. Fun Fact 癖 is a word that has developed a 'negative' meaning over time. Originally, 癖 was used to convey a preference, or the side that someone or something tended to lean toward (due to it being favorable for some reason). When adding the case marking particle に to this, it merely expressed that (A) was the preferable state/location, so (B) not being/not acting in a way appropriate for (A) is less than desirable.",N3
くらい,くらい,prt,"About, Approximately","くらい or ぐらい (more common in spoken language) has several different uses in Japanese, but is often translated as 'about', or 'approximately'. It comes from the kanji 位 , which literally means a 'rank', or 'grade' of something. This use of くらい comes after numbers, or counter words. As can be seen in the last example, くらい may also be used after question words such as どの , when asking about the extent (grade) of something. Due to the original meaning of くらい being 'rank', or 'extent', it may not be used when referring to broad periods of time. ころ will be used in these situations. However, くらい and ころ may be used interchangeably when referring to a specific time (due to a specific time being able to be thought of as an extent). Caution Please see the ころ grammar point if you would like to compare these two structures further.",N5
くらい,くらい,,"To the extent that, So…that, About the only thing that...","Often, the noun くらい is used as an adverbial particle . This use of くらい (or ぐらい) expresses the limit of something, in a similar way to ほど. This means that it can be translated as 'about (A)', 'so (A) that (B)', or '(A) to the extent of (B)'. Let's take a look at a few examples. Despite translating in the above ways, we can see that this use of くらい is similar to the standard kanji use 位 , which literally means a 'rank', or 'grade' of something. What this means is that (A) will usually be considered to be at the 'grade' of something that was required in order to cause/allow (B).",N3
来る,くる,v-unspec,To come,"来 る is one of only two main verbs in Japanese that do not follow the standard rules of conjugation for Godan and Ichidan verbs. The other primary verb being する . 来 る means 'to come', or 'to be coming'. 来 る will always have the particle に or へ attached to the location that someone 'will come', or 'has come'. The reason that 来 る is called a か-column irregular conjugation verb in Japanese is because the る in 来 る does not conjugate, but is dropped. This leaves the く being the part that conjugates. Because of this, 来る has qualities of both る-Verbs (the る being dropped), and う-Verbs (the remaining く changing depending on the conjugation). Here are some examples of how 来 る changes. （き）た, （く）る, （こ）ない. 来 る will often be seen as 来 ている when someone has come to a place and remains there. This is due to ている meaning 'to exist in the state of an action', rather than being exactly the same as '(A)~ing' in English. Because of this, 来 ている can mean either 'to be somewhere that one has come', or 'to be coming'. Sometimes the difference between these two will not be clear unless there is further context. Caution 来 ている (for existing at a place) is only used for places that people 'temporarily' go, so will not be used when you are at your home/work.",N5
くれる,くれる,v-unspec,"To give (me), To be given","くれる is generally taught as part of a set of 3 verbs that are regularly used for giving and receiving in Japanese. These verbs are くれる , あげる , and もらう . くれる means 'to give' (to you, or someone that is part of your 'in' group). With くれる and あげる , they both function in the regular way you would expect (regarding particles). This means that が will always mark the giver (the person performing the action), and に will mark the recipient (the person that is the 'destination' of the thing that is given). This means that を will be used to mark the 'object' that is given, as is usually the case. The giver/recipient are often omitted from sentences with くれる , as one/both are usually obvious from context, or the sentence may be focussing on the object. As can be seen here, the same nuance is kept, even when things are omitted. Fun Fact What someone considers their 'in' group will be different for each person, but usually consists of members of your family, clubs that you are in, or something similar that has a 'group' atmosphere (that you are a part of). The giver will always be someone that is more distant than the people that are in the 'group'. Caution When we want to say that we (or someone else) gave something to someone that is not in our 'in' group, we will need to use あげる instead.",N5
くらいなら,ぐらいなら,,"Would rather...than, Rather than, Better off","くらいなら will often be translated as 'would rather (B) than (A)', or 'better off (B) than (A)'. It is a grammar pattern that combines the adverbial particle usages of くらい 'about' and なら 'if' to imply that 'if it gets to the extent of (A), then (B)', where (B) will be something that is preferable. くらいなら will be used directly following verbs in their dictionary forms . As this structure emphasizes (A) as being something that is undesirable, (B) will often contain statements that offer a solution, suggestion, or opinion, such as ほうがいい 'would be better to', ほうがましだ 'would be less bad', なさい 'do!'. Caution Although くらいなら will always follow a verb in dictionary form , the second half of the sentence may imply that (A) has actually already happened, and the speaker is wishing that it hadn't. In these cases, くらいなら almost always translates to 'if I had known that (A), then I would have (B)'.",N1
包みで,ぐるみで,,"Whole, -wide, Across the, Entire, All of, With … altogether","When following nouns, the suffix ぐるみ 'including (A)', 'all over (A)', or '(A) wide' is used to express that something encompasses absolutely all of (A). ぐるみ stem from the う-Verb 包 む, meaning 'to wrap', or 'to encompass'. In many cases, the case marking particle で will follow ぐるみ to mark 'with', but の may also be seen when preceding a second noun. ぐるみ is most frequently seen following words that specify a whole 'group' or 'span' to which the topic of the sentence is only one part of. This could be one member of a family, one home within a neighborhood, one student within a school, or any other number of things that share a clearly identifiable link. Despite this, the primary nuance will always be that the group itself shares a common trait, rather than focusing on any individual part.",N1
結構,けっこう,adv,"Quite, A lot, Fairly, Rather","結構 is a な-Adjective that is actually used more frequently as a sentence altering adverb, than it is as a な-Adjective . What this means is that it is regularly used before an entire phrase (without な or だ ), and it will modify the entire sentence. The most common meaning that 結構 has is 'quite' (a bit/a lot). Fun Fact 結構 is used very similarly in Japanese to 'no thank you', or 'I'm fine thanks' in English. For example, if someone asks you if you want to try a sample in a shop, most people would just say 結構 です .",N5
けど,けど・だけど,prt,"But, However","けど is one of the common conjunction particles in Japanese. These are particles that function by connecting the (A) and (B) parts of a sentence. けど works very similarly to が , in that it highlights 'while thinking about (A), (B)'. This means that けど will often come across as 'but' in English. As can be seen from these examples, just like many other grammatical constructions, だ will be required when using けど after a な-Adjective , or a noun. けど is just a modern (casual) version of けれども . Please see below for a list of the most casual, to the most formal variations. Casual - けど - けども - けれど - けれども - が - Formal. Caution The phrase after けど will often be omitted if it is obvious, or the speaker does not want to say it.",N5
けれども,けれども,prt,"But, Although","けれども is the more formal (full version) of the conjunction particle けど . Like けど , it usually carries the meaning of 'but', but because of its formality, sounds a bit more like 'although', or 'provided that'. It simply highlights that 'while thinking about (A), (B)'. Meaning that the (B) phrase is important, or needs to be considered. As can be seen from these examples, だ will be required when using this conjunction after a な-Adjective , or a noun. As a reminder, please see below for a list of the most casual form of 'but', to the most formal. Casual - けど - けども - けれど - けれども - が - Formal. Fun Fact Originally, けれども was thought to be a more feminine version of が . However, the modern けど is so common that it has lost all of the feminine nuance that came from けれども . Caution As with けど (and other forms of 'but' in Japanese), the phrase after けれども will often be omitted if it is obvious, or the speaker does not want to say it.",N5
気,げ,,"Seemingly, Giving appearance of, [Expresses emotions or feelings]","げ , sometimes seen in the kanji form 気 is a suffix in Japanese that expresses that something is 'giving off the feeling of (A)', or 'seems like (A)'. げ is frequently used in relation to emotions, feelings, and things that the speaker generally can't be 100% sure of due to them not being directly visible. げ is primarily seen used after the stem form of い-Adjectives, but may also appear following the stem forms of nouns of な-Adjectives. In all of these cases, the addition of げ creates a new な-Adjective meaning '(A) seeming'. Due to this, げ may then be followed by either な or に, depending on whether it is altering a verb or a noun later in the sentence. げ is more subjective (based on the speaker's opinion) than そう, and is considered to be very low confidence. This may be considered a byproduct of the original 気 , meaning of 'attention', referring to the way that the speaker 'senses (A)', regardless of what is actually true for (A) on the inside.",N2
ここ,ここ,n,"Here, This place","ここ is one of the forms of the これ family of words used to identify things close to the speaker. In this case it demonstrates a place. In the same way that これ represents 'this', ここ represents 'this place', or simply 'here'. Fun Fact The full family of words used for identification/demonstration in Japanese are referred to as こそあど 言葉 (KO, SO, A, DO words). These include all of the different forms of これ , それ , あれ , and どれ . Caution ここ should not be confused with こっち, a similar word which is also sometimes translated as 'here'. こっち focuses more on the direction that one is/is going, while ここ focuses purely on 'this (stationary) place'.",N5
こそすれ〜ない,こそすれ〜ない,,"And certainly not, But certainly not, But, Although, Even though","Occasionally in Japanese, the adverbial particle こそ will be seen followed by the realis form (sometimes referred to as the perfective form) of verbs. This is a classical verb form that does not have a modern counterpart. However, the hypothetical form has largely replaced the realis form in the manner in conjugates. The verbs that will be seen altered this way are する ‘to do’, なる ‘to become’, and ある ‘to be’. They will respectively become こそすれ , こそなれ, and こそあれ , and are used specifically for emphasis. Common translations include ‘certainly not (B), but (A)’, or ‘even though (B), actually (A)’. The (B) phrase in this grammar point will include a negative statement, and is usually something that the speaker is responding to or correcting about what another person mistakenly thought. こそすれ may attach to either the noun part of する-Verbs, or the conjunctive form of standard verbs. なれ and あれ will be used based on the standard rules of what type of word なる would usually appear with (a noun or adjective), and what type of word ある would usually appear with (a noun). Caution There are cases where the base verb will have been entered in some way, like by having the causative or the passive auxiliary verbs attached to them before the new base will be altered with こそする. So you will need to work out what verb stem is actually being used in any given sentence.",N1
こそ,こそ,,"For sure, For certain, Even more so, Underlined or bolded text","こそ is an adverbial particle in Japanese that primarily replaces either を or が. Its main role is to highlight the preceding noun (or noun phrase) as being the the most important piece of information in relation to the rest of the sentence. In English, this is an effect that is primarily achieved through things like bold text, underlining, or emphasizing a particular word in speech. If we were to make a direct comparison to an English statement, then things like 'precisely because it's (A)', or 'rather it is due to (A)', are quite similar to こそ 's function. こそ can be used directly after any noun that would usually take the を , or が particles, so long as that particular piece of information needs to be emphasized. Caution The reason that こそ is able to replace が, but not は, is due to the fact that が primarily highlights specific pieces of information, while は nominates general topics. This means that they have completely opposite functions. To make things easier, the three particles can be thought of in the following way: は- Weakly highlights specific information. が- Strongly highlights specific information. こそ - Very strongly highlights specific information. Fun Fact こそ is often used after names or pronouns, as a way to reply to thanks/apologies. In these situations, it expresses that the speaker feels equally (or more) obliged to say what was just said to them by someone else.",N3
事から,ことから,,From the fact that,"In order to come to a logical conclusion about something in Japanese, sometimes strong expressions like ことから will be used. This is a combination of the noun こと, and the case marking particle から. ことから literally means 'from that which is (A), (B)', but is generally simply translated as 'from the fact that (A), (B)'. ことから may be connected to the end of any phrase, so long as the word before it is in its attributive form . Caution There is a difference between ことから 'from the fact that' and ことだから 'because'. In ことだから , から is a conjunction particle that links the (A) and (B) parts of a sentence. However, in ことから , から is a case marking particle , meaning that it is highlighting the subject.",N3
事か…,ことか,,"How…, What..., God knows...","ことか is a combination of こと 'thing', and the case marking particle か, used to present a question. In sentences with ことか , words that highlight some particular number or extent are often used, before ことか comes at the end of the statement, expressing that 'extent' as being particularly unusual, or even unbelievable (thanks to the addition of か). This is often translated simply as 'how (A)', 'what (A)', or even 'god knows (A)'. Let's look at a few examples. Literally, ことか can be translated as 'to what particular (A) is (B)!?', as the enquiry is often not directed at anyone specifically, but instead presents itself as a question simply to emphasize its magnitude. Caution In modern Japanese, this expression is used primarily in written language, and has a tendency to sound either poetic, or dramatic. Because of this, it may sound unnatural in daily speech, unless the speaker is purposely being dramatic.",N3
事がある,ことがある,,"Something is possible, Sometimes, Occasionally, There are times when","ことがある is an expression in Japanese that combines the noun こと with the case marking particle が, and the う - Verb, ある. It is often translated as 'to be possible', 'to occasionally occur', or 'to sometimes occur'. However, the more literal translation of ことがある is '(A) is a thing that exists'. ことがある may be paired with the attributive form of any other word. Occasionally, が may be replaced by も. In these situations, it implies that '(A) is also a thing that exists'. Basically this just highlights that (A) is something that needs to be considered (among other things). Caution ことがある differs from たことがある (a phrase commonly paired with the past form of verbs). たことがある highlights a single event in which the (A) verb was completed. However, when the verb is not in past form, it simply implies that there are 'times' when the verb happens, as opposed to a single/specific time.",N3
ことが出来る,ことができる,,"Can, Be able to","Like ことがある , ことができる is an expression that nominalizes what comes before it (turns it into a noun-phrase), and then highlights something about that (A) phrase. In the case of ことができる , the thing being highlighted about (A) is that it is 'possible'. This translates as 'can do (A)', or 'to be able to do (A)'. However, こと is only required when the (A) phrase needs nominalization (is not a noun to begin with). Due to this, ができる may be used by itself when following a noun, without changing the meaning. Fun Fact のが (or のは ) is also frequently used for nominalization, but this is rarely the case when a verb follows it. Some other expressions where のが may not be swapped for こと are as follows: ことがある - For (A) to exist. ことにする - To make something (A). ことになる - For (A) to come to be.",N4
事だから,ことだから,,It is exactly because,"ことだから is a set expression used for indicating that the speaker is fairly certain about (B), based specifically on their experience with (A). This is often translated as 'it is exactly because (A) that (B)', or 'precisely because it is (A), (B)'. ことだから is a combination of the noun こと 'thing', だ, and から. The literal meaning can be interpreted as 'from that it's (A), also (B)'. This just implies that due to (A) being a predetermined fact, (B) too can be assumed to be true. When making assumptions, ことだから will often be seen following verbs in their dictionary forms, or nouns followed by の. Alternatively, ことだから may appear following verbs in any of their standard forms when the situation of (A) is considered as a good opportunity to also do (B), according to the speaker. Lastly, ことだから may simply imply (strongly) that (A) is the reason for (B). In these cases, either verbs in their standard forms or nouns followed by の may precede ことだから . Despite having these three slightly different nuances, the speaker's intended meaning will usually be clear in the (B) part of the sentence. Due to this, ことだから may always be thought to simply mean that 'by the logic of (A), definitely (B)'.",N2
ことだし(),ことだし,,"(And) so, Because, Since","ことだし is a combination of the noun こと 'thing', the auxiliary verb だ, and the conjunction particle し, used for listing reasons. The whole structure itself often translates simply as 'because (A)', or 'since (A)', but places extra emphasis on there being other reasons besides what the speaker has specified. This structure may appear after any word in its attributive form , or after a noun that has been followed with の. Just like with its standard use in creating lists, し is being used in this grammar point to show that (A) is not exclusive. The way this comes across is that 'while there are other reasons, (A) is good enough to (B)'. (B) is usually some suggestion, invitation, or expression of determination.",N1
事だ,ことだ,,"Should, Ought","As a sentence ending particle , こと has two primary functions. These are as follows: 願望 や 軽 い 命令 を 表 す - Highlighting a desire or weak command. 感嘆 や 疑問 を 表 す - Highlighting astonishment or doubt. We will focus on the first meaning in this grammar point, as the 'astonishment' nuance is not as commonly used in modern Japanese, and is primarily used only by women. At the end of a sentence, こと will be paired with the dictionary (or ない) form of a verb, to highlight a particular action that either should, or should not occur. It is usually grouped with the auxiliary verb だ , although this is not always the case. This construction is most often translated as 'should/should not (A)', or 'ought to/not (A)'. Caution This use of こと implies a certain level of 'authority', and is therefore regularly used in relation to set rules and expectations (can very frequently be seen on signs in shops/parks, etc). Due to this, it should not be used when giving 'general' advice, especially to people of higher status.",N3
こととて,こととて,,"Due to, Since, On account of, Because","こととて is a combination of the noun こと 'thing', and the binding (adverbial) particle とて, which is used for presenting reasons. It will be translated as 'due to (A)', or 'because of (A)'. This is a fairly old-fashioned expression, and will almost exclusively be used in writing in modern Japanese. To use こととて , attach it to the end of a verb, or a noun followed by the case-marking particle の. こととて will primarily be used when asking for forgiveness for something. Due to this, when appearing after verbs, the verb will usually be in past tense, or have been negated with either ない or ぬ. This highlights something that was done and shouldn't have been, or wasn't done and should have been. In many cases, (A) will be something for which the negative result of (B) is obvious, or to be expected. Fun Fact とて is thought to either be a combination of the case-marking particle と and the conjunction particle て, or the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb たり, と, and the conjunction particle て. As the origin is unclear, it will be best to think of it as its own structure, that carries its own original meaning.",N1
事無く,ことなく,,Without ~ing,"Like ないで 'without', ことなく is an expression used in Japanese following verbs that expresses (B) being done 'without (A)'. However; ことなく is used in more formal situations, and when there is some contrast between (A) and (B). This may appear in one of two ways, which we will discuss in a moment. ことなく is a mix of こと, and なく, the adverbial form of ない. It will follow the dictionary form of verbs. The first contrastive use of ことなく illustrates that (A) is something negative, to which (B) should be done as a preventative measure, or was able to be done while avoiding (A). The second use of ことなく highlights when (A) is something that was or would be wished for, but unfortunately (B) happened without it being realized. In this way, (A) is frequently some kind of unmet desire.",N2
事なの(),ことなの,,"(A) is (Description of A), (A) means that (Description of A)","When the noun こと (or 事 in its kanji form) is combined with なの, it conveys an explanatory meaning that is similar to what can be seen in the んです・のです grammar pattern. As with んです , ことなの transforms 'it is (A)', into 'it is that it is (A)', simply emphasizing the point. ことなの may be seen in several different forms, and is quite often used in conjunction with というのは . In these types of sentences, というのは will present the topic, before ことなの will be used to show the conclusion that the speaker has drawn about that topic. This expression may be used with any word in its attributive form , nouns followed by の, or な-Adjectives followed by な. という may also be used directly before ことなの . However, this is not always the case, and is even more unlikely when it was already utilized in the first half of the sentence. Caution As というのは is quite long, it will often be shortened to って or とは in casual speech. Caution ことなの is also frequently used when asking questions. This is usually when the speaker has drawn a conclusion about something that has been said, and wants to confirm their understanding. なのか is very frequently heard/seen in drama, novels, manga, and similar types of media, but may be considered rude in daily speech.",N3
事にする,ことにする,,"To decide on, Have decided to","In a similar way to how にする means to 'decide on' something, ことにする means to decide on a situation, or course of action. This grammar point is a combination of 事 'thing' in its role as a nominalizer (a word that creates a noun-phrase), and にする 'to make it (A)'. Literally this grammar structure can be translated as 'to do (A)', or 'to make it (A)'. ことにする may be used with verb-phrases that are either in the affirmative, or negative (using ない) forms. As こと itself is a noun , the verb (or auxiliary verb) that comes before it will need to be in its attributive form . にする is a strong expression, which tends to make the speaker sound like they are fairly resolute in their decision. Caution The する in にする itself may also be seen using ない, to mean that someone has decided 'against' doing something. Due to this, careful attention will need to be paid to the overall structure of the sentence.",N3
事になっている,ことになっている,,"To be expected to, To be scheduled to","ことになっている is an alternation of ことになる , a grammar point showing that something has been decided by someone other than the speaker. It is a combination of the nominalizing use of こと (for creating noun-phrases), and the ている-form of the う-Verb なる 'to become'. The primary difference between ことになる and ことになっている is that the latter focuses more on that something is 'expected to (A)', or 'scheduled to (A)'. In other words, it is 'becoming that (A)', but has not actually happened yet. This structure is often used after either the る or ない versions of verbs, in order to highlight the action which either is not not 'expected', or 'scheduled' to occur. Let's take a look at the 'scheduled to' meaning first. When indicating that something is 'expected to (A)', this is an example of ている's use for expressing habitual or ongoing actions/states that reoccur under some specific set conditions.",N2
事になる,ことになる,,"It will end up being, It is the result of, It has been decided that","ことになる is an expression that combines the nominalizing use of こと (creating a noun-phrase), with the case marking particle に , and the う - Verb なる 'to become'. This expression can be translated as 'to become (A)', but has the nuance that someone/thing caused (A) to become that way. Due to this, it may also be translated as 'it has been decided that (A)', or 'it will end up being (A)'. ことになる is primarily used with verbs and い-Adjectives in their attributive form . It may also be used with な-Adjectives followed by な. The 'it has been decided that (A)' meaning only applies to verbs, as only verbs will be enacted by someone/thing. Fun Fact This structure is a good example of why なる is often viewed as the intransitive form of する . する conveys that someone is performing an action (transitive), while なる implies that something is the result of an action (intransitive). This is why the (A)  phrase in ことになる is usually determined to have been decided/performed by someone else, while still focusing on exactly 'what' (A) became.",N3
事にはならない,ことにはならない,,Just because… doesn't mean…,"ことにはならない is an expression which is often seen at the end of sentences when the speaker wants to emphasize that something said earlier is not necessarily the case. Often, structures like ても 'even if' or からといって 'just because' will appear in the first half of the sentence, before ことにはならない will simply highlight that 'it will not be that (B)'. As a grouping, the whole expression is often interpreted as 'just because (A), it doesn't mean that (B)'. ことにはならない is a construction of こと, に, は, and the negated form of the う-Verb なる 'to become'. In this way, the literal meaning is that 'just because of (A), (B) is not something that will come about'. Although not required, the (B) expression may be emphasized even further by the inclusion of という before ことにはならない .",N2
ことに,ことに,,"Extremely, Especially, To my ...","When 事 'thing' is combined with the case-marking particle に following a statement, it highlights that something is of a 'great extent'. Common translations include 'particularly', 'especially', or 'to my (A)'. This grammar pattern almost always describes some kind of feeling or emotion. ことに is regularly seen after verbs, い or な-Adjectives . In most situations, '(A) ことに (B)' can be translated quite literally as 'to a particularly (A) extent, (B)'. Fun Fact A very common expression 幸 いなことに uses this particular grammar structure as a set phrase, and is often translated simply as 'fortunately', or 'luckily'. Fun Fact ことに may sometimes be seen before descriptions rather than following them. In these cases, it comes from the kanji 殊 , and is being used adverbially in the same was as 特 に to mean 'particularly' or 'especially'.",N3
事はない,ことはない,,"There is no need to, Never happens","ことはない is an expression that has two primary purposes in Japanese. To convey that there is 'no need for (A)', or that '(A) never happens'. In these cases, (A) is a verb that will appear directly before こと. ことはない is often used to reassure someone that something will not come to pass. In this expression, the adverbial particle は is working to present (A) as the extent (a regular role of adverbial particles), while the 形容詞 ない negates that extent. This negation is up to interpretation, with the literal meaning simply being 'There is no (A)'. Caution This structure is very different to たことがない, which presents a single instance of something not having happened. As opposed to the case marking particle が, は presents the verb/verb-phrase as a topic itself in non-past form, highlighting its non-existence. Due to this, ことはない can imply that (A) is unthinkable, or even impossible.",N3
ことは〜が,ことは〜が,,"It is true...but, although, but","ことは～が is a set expression which indicates that 'while something is (A), also (B)'. In English, this is usually interpreted as '(A) is true, but (B), or 'although (A), (B)'. When this grammar structure is used, the same word will be repeated before both ことは and が (or けど). Due to this, the literal translation is similar to 'that which is (A) is (A), but (B)'. This simply emphasizes that the speaker recognizes (A) as being true, but would like to express information that is contrary to that. ことは～が can appear with any type of word, but だ will need to be used following nouns before が, while な, である, だった or ではない tends to follow な-Adjectives. In most cases, ことは～が expresses that the base fact of (A) is true, but the speaker has some sort of opinion or impression that is in opposition to that fact.",N2
こと,こと,,Converting a verb into a noun,"In a very similar way to のは , こと is used in Japanese for nominalization (creating a noun-like phrase). However, unlike のは , which is a combination of two particles, こと is a noun . To use こと , just add it to the end of a verb in its dictionary form. こと (or 事 in its kanji form) is a noun that is often translated as 'thing', and in this way, literally means 'the thing that is (A)' when used for nominalization. As we can see from these examples, ない can also be used between the verb and こと , to form a 'not' statement. There are other auxiliary verbs that may be used with こと in this way, but ない is the most common. Although this lesson discusses こと pairing with the dictionary form of verbs, it can actually pair with any standard verb form. Standard form just means anything that does not finish with the polite ます. Fun Fact Unlike もの (another noun used to describe 'things'), こと is a noun that is frequently used to describe things that are 'intrinsic'. This basically means things that are describable, but not necessarily always observable (feelings, conditions, events, etc.). Caution When a sentence (usually short) finishes with こと , it quite often has the nuance of being a rule, or command. This こと is not actually a noun, but a sentence ending particle . こと as a particle will almost never be written in the kanji form. However, it does originate from the same word.",N4
この,この,adj-na,This,"この is classified as a ' pre-noun adjectival ' in Japanese. These are a special type of word that do not conjugate. This means that they will always appear in the same form. この comes from the same family of words as これ and ここ , and is used to identify a 'thing' that is near the speaker. As the name ' pre-noun adjectival ' suggests, these words will always appear before a noun, and describe that noun in some way.",N5
これ,これ,n,This,"これ is often thought to be equal to 'this' in English, which is basically correct. これ will always be used to highlight something that is close to the speaker either emotionally, or physically. Despite being translated as a ' pronoun ' in English, it might be easier to think of これ as a substitute noun (the literal meaning in Japanese), as this is always its function. これ substitutes for something that has its own name, but is not required in the context of the sentence, or is simply unknown by the speaker.",N5
御座います,ございます,,"To be, To exist (Polite)","ございます is a combination of the (special-class) verb, ござる ( 御座 る in its kanji form), and the auxiliary verb ます. It is considered polite speech , and is directly equivalent to ある (or いる ). ござる itself is almost never used in daily conversation in modern Japanese, due to the preference of the polite form, ございます . However, ござる is regularly used in dramas, manga, and other forms of media (especially historical dramas). Fun Fact 御座 る literally means 'to be', and it does not matter whether the object that is being described is animate (would usually use いる), or inanimate (would usually use ある). However, いらっしゃる 'to be' is preferred when referring to other people, as honorific language is more respectful than polite speech . Due to this, ございます will often be used in reference to people, in place of であります (the polite form of である ). Notice that で is used in these examples. でございます itself is considered its own grammatical structure, that we will examine in a separate grammar point.",N4
毎に,ごとに,,"Each, Every","ごとに is a combination of the noun ごと , and the particle に . Together, they are used adverbially to express that something happens 'every (A)', or 'at intervals of (A)'. ごとに may be used after any verb (usually in non-past form), or noun. Although ごとに may be used after verbs, the most common use is with nouns, or phrases that finish with nouns. Caution ごと is the 訓読 み (Japanese reading) of the kanji 毎 , which means 'every'. This fact will be important when trying to remember the difference between ごとに and おきに , a similar grammar point which can also mean 'every', but focuses more on 'interval' or 'gap' of a specific time or distance. Due to おきに focusing on the space between 'each (A)', there are sentences where おきに and ごとに will have different meanings. Here, we can see that ごとに will mean 'every week', while おきに will mean 'every second week', due to there being a 'one week interval' when おきに is used. To make things easier, these two expressions can be remembered in the following way. (A) ごとに = During every (A), (B). (A) おきに = After every space of (A), (B). Fun Fact Many native speakers make mistakes with the difference between おきに and ごとに , so there are quite a large number of people (especially in the younger generation) that will consider them completely interchangeable.",N4
頃,ごろ,,"Around, About","ころ , or ごろ (the colloquial pronunciation) is a word which carries the meaning of 'around', or 'about'. It is utilized in a similar way to くらい , but has a few differences. When ごろ is used, it will need to be attached to the end of a noun, or a noun followed by の . The main difference between ころ and くらい is that ころ can be (and often is) used to express a broad point in time, while くらい is limited to expressing timeframes that are more specific. Conversely, ころ will not be used when expressing approximate distances/lengths. The primary reason for this is that ころ expresses a span of something, while くらい expresses an extent. In this way, ころ could also be translated as 'within the span of (A)', while くらい is closer to 'at the point of (A)'. As an easier way to think about it, if we have a one meter ruler, ころ could express anywhere between 1 to 100 centimeters (the span), but くらい can only express somewhere between 90 and 100 centimeters (the extent). Just like with English, if the 'time' expressed is very specific, then either くらい or ころ could be used naturally. This is due to the 'span', and the 'extent' already being something that is a 'precise point' in these cases. Caution The kanji form of 頃 is also very common, so it is worth learning as soon as possible, to save any confusion while reading.",N4
さえ～ば,さえ〜ば,,"If only…then, As long as..., Provided..., Only thing ... needs for ... is ...","As a set expression, さえ～ば is a combination of the adverbial particle さえ , and the conjunction particle ば . It is used to highlight assumption , and presents (A) as a extreme limitation that is required to achieve (B), hypothetically. This structure may be translated as 'if only (A), then (B)', 'the only thing needed for (A) is (B)', or 'as long as (A), (B)'. さえ may be grouped with any word, but will require the conjunctive form , or て form before it when grouped with verbs. It also regularly appears after other particles, forming a dual-particle meaning. This use of さえ is an example of limit , with (A) being a hypothetical limit presented by the ば particle. It is also possible to see さえ with other hypothetical indicators (such as たら ), but is quite rare in modern Japanese, as さえ～ば is considered a set pattern. This limitation is also sometimes referred to as a 'stipulation', or 'condition' .",N3
さえ,さえ,,Even,"さえ is an adverbial particle in Japanese that is used to place emphasis on something existing in certain state. It is often translated as 'even'. さえ has three primary meanings, which are as follows: Analogical Reasoning: 類推 - Analogy, (A) is an outstanding example of something. Limit: 限定 - Limit, (A) is all that is needed for something. Addition: 添加 - (A) compounds something that is pre-existing. さえ is regularly paired with other particles and is often followed by verbs in negative form, with the overall meaning usually being determined by what part (B) of the sentence is conveying. Let's look at a few examples. In each of these cases, we can see how さえ is showing that (A) is an extreme example of something. Fun Fact は, も, でも, and さえ are all adverbial particles that can be thought of as having a relationship toward, and away from what is 'expected' in any given situation. This relationship can be seen here: (A) は - (A) is completely expected, there is nothing unusual. (A) も - (A) will be included as part of what is expected, but can be unusual. (A) でも - (A) may or may not be included as part of what is expected, and can be unusual. (A) さえ - (A) is separated completely from what is expected, and is unusual. Due to this unexpected and unusual situation that さえ always presents, it is regularly translated as 'let alone (A)', or 'not to mention (A)'.",N3
流石,さすが,,"as one would expect, only natural, that is just like..., even","さすが , also often appearing in the kanji form 流石 , is an adverb that indicates the speaker's feeling of being impressed that something has lived up to its reputation, or what was expected of it. In English, this comes across as 'as expected of (A)', or 'that is just like (A)'. As 流石 is an adverb, it may appear at the beginning of phrases (either with or without に), or directly preceded a noun when の is used. Caution Although uncommon, さすが may occasionally have a negative connotation. In these cases, it is similar to 'even' in English. This use of さすが implies that 'as one had though, even (A) couldn't (B)', and similar nuances. Fun-fact The kanji structure of 流石 is a type of kanji use known as 借字 in Japanese. This basically means 'borrowed symbol', and indicates that the meaning of the kanji is not related to the meaning of the word at all.",N2
さぞ,さぞ,,"You must be very, How … you must be, I dare to say, I am sure or certain that you must be very","さぞ is a fairly formal adverb in Japanese that is used emphatically to highlight that the following statement is something that the speaker understands to be true. This is often in relation to the feelings or situation of another. Common translations include 'you must be very (A)', 'how (A) you must be', or 'I dare say that (A)'. 'I dare to say that (A)' is probably the closest to the literal meaning of さぞ , as the speaker is empathizing with someone else by trying to imagine the situation from their point of view. As さぞ is an adverb, it will usually appear at the beginning of a sentence, modifying the whole phrase that follows. The phrase following さぞ will often finish with だろう or でしょう. This highlights the speaker's opinion about the situation as being limited by their own knowledge. Caution さぞ comes from the kanji 嘸 , which has two alternative readings, 嘸 や, and 嘸 かし. Both 嘸 や, and 嘸 かし are occasionally used as even further emphasized versions of さぞ . Despite being almost identical in meaning, さぞかし is used more often than さぞや.",N1
さて,さて,,"Well, Well then","Acting as a conjunction , さて is a word used when one wants to change the topic of conversation, or is ready to move on to a new point. Usually it is translated as 'well', or 'well then'. さて will appear at the beginning of a sentence, before the speaker highlights what the new topic is. Fun Fact Although さて is extremely rarely written in kanji, 扨 or 偖 may be seen every now and then. Both of these kanji have the same meaning of 'now' (now being the beginning of something new).",N3
更に,更に,,"Even more or further, Again, More and more","更 に is word that is often used adverbially in Japanese to convey the meaning of 'more and more', 'even more than (A)', or 'again'. This use is an extension of the base meaning that the kanji 更 has in indicating that something is 'approaching change'. Because of this, the expression used following 更 に will always be something that is either further along than the initial statement either in regard to time, quantity, or volume. Taking this into consideration, 'in addition to (A)' may also be used as a fairly standard translation. As さらに is used adverbially, it often appears at the beginning of part (B) of a sentence, after the 'base' information has already been indicated. Fun-fact The meaning of 更 as 'approaching change' merely indicates that something has already reached 'fullness', and anything more than that will cause a fundamental change in the state of (A). Due to this, さらに primarily indicates things where (A) is considered 'complete' or 'enough' in and of itself, and what happens in (B) pushes that thing beyond a certain threshold. This may be either positive or negative depending on the sentence.",N2
さ,さ,,Casual よ,"さ is a 感動詞 (interjection) in Japanese that has three primary uses. These are as follows: 誘 い、 促 し - To invite, incite, or draw attention to something. 驚 き、 当惑 し - The express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment. 話 の 流 れ を 抑 える - To control or keep in check the flow of a conversation. In this lesson, we will be focusing on a specific feature of the first meaning (to draw attention). Unlike other types of drawing attention that さ is able to be used for (see this grammar point), this さ will only appear at the end of sentences. Here, さ is almost identical in meaning to that of よ, with a slight added nuance of high confidence in what one is saying. Caution This さ is primarily used by men, and can vary in meaning depending on the speaker's tone of voice. However, in almost all situations さ will mean 'what I just said is correct' (sometimes angrily, sometimes informatively, and even sometimes in a completely carefree way). Women may also use さ as a sentence ender, but わよ tends to be more common.",N3
さ,さ,,"Like, You know, You see, Listen, Uhh","さ is a 感動詞 (interjection) in Japanese that has three primary uses. These are as follows: 誘 い、 促 し - To invite, incite, or draw attention to something. 驚 き、 当惑 し - The express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment. 話 の 流 れ を 抑 える - To control or keep in check the flow of a conversation. In this lesson, we will be focusing on the second meaning (to express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment). In English, this is used in a very similar way to 'like', 'you know', 'uhh', and other short phrases that are employed when a speaker is searching for the right thing to say, and is filling the silence. This さ may be used in any position within a sentence, simply to create thinking time. The 'confusion' that this さ expresses is not necessarily a bad thing, and is used by many people to simply express that they have not finished talking yet.",N3
さ,さ,,"All right, There we go, Now, You see, Well (I don't know, let me see)","さ is a 感動詞 (interjection) in Japanese that has three primary uses. These are as follows: 誘 い、 促 し - To invite, incite, or draw attention to something. 驚 き、 当惑 し - To express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment. 話 の 流 れ を 抑 える - To control or keep in check the flow of a conversation. In this lesson, we will be focusing on the first meaning (to invite or draw attention). In English, this is usually translated as 'there we go', 'ok then', or 'well you see'. さ (or sometimes さあ) will come at the beginning of a sentence, before the point that the speaker would like to highlight is explained. Caution This さ and the さ used for expressing confusion or bewilderment are often used interchangeably. When drawing attention, it comes across like 'well you see', but when expressing confusion, it is closer to 'well let me see'. The latter has a slight nuance of 'let me think about my answer first'.",N3
さ,さ,,Converting adjectives to nouns,"さ is a suffix in Japanese that can be attached to the stem form of い-Adjectives and な-Adjectives . When this happens, it transforms the target adjective into a noun that illustrates the 'amount' of that particular adjective. This commonly translates as '-ness' in English (sweetness, tallness, spiciness, etc), but is referred to as degree in Japanese. Fun Fact It is thought that this suffix originally stemmed from the kanji 差 (meaning 'distinction'), and was used for highlighting things that were distinctive features of something. In this way, さ is also sometimes used after the dictionary form of verbs, to highlight a distinct point in time that something happens. However, this use of the suffix is far less common in modern Japanese, and is known as ' poetic language '. It was primarily used during Japan's 'middle ages', which spanned from (around) 1100, until close to the end of the 1500's.",N4
ざるを得ない',ざるを得ない,,"Can't help doing, Have no choice but","ざる is the 連体形 (attributive form) of the old-fashioned auxiliary verb ざり. ざり carries the same meaning as the modern ない, in negating what comes before it. When joined with a combination of the る-Verb 得 る 'to gain', or 'to acquire', and the auxiliary verb ない, it becomes a double-negative structure meaning that one 'cannot help doing (A)', or 'there is no choice but to (A)'. More literally, it means that one 'can't not (A)'. For the most part, this structure will conjugate with other verbs in exactly the same way as ない. Caution As ざり is an old-fashioned structure, it conjugates a little bit differently with する than the regular ない. Notice here that instead of しない changing to しざる, せざる will be used instead.",N2
～ざる,～ざる,,"To not ~, Un~","ざる is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb ず. It keeps the same negation 'not' meaning as ず, and will conjugate with verbs in the same way as ない. ざる will also often be translated as 'un~', like in 'unstoppable'. In most cases, ざる will be seen attached to verbs that are describing a noun that comes directly after them. Although ざる may be used in place of ない, in modern Japanese it is primarily only seen as part of common expressions or sayings, such as the ざるを 得 ない 'have no choice but to (A)' grammar structure. Caution As with many old-fashioned grammar patterns, ざる will conjugate with the せ stem of する, rather than the more modern し stem. Fun-fact Some dictionaries list ざる as the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb ざり. However, ざり itself is just a contraction of ず and あり 'to be'. Due to this, both variations may be considered as correct, with ず being the underlying origination.",N2
しかしながら,しかしながら,,"However, Nevertheless, But","When combined with the conjunction しかし 'however', the particle ながら 'while', or 'although' creates a new word which itself is used as a conjunction, or occasionally adverbially. しかしながら is itself often translated as 'however', or 'nevertheless', although it is stronger than しかし by itself. A more literal translation which may carry the strength of this grammar pattern a bit better would be 'while however, (B)', or 'even while true, (B)'. Just like in English, the extension of the phrase in Japanese adds emphasis to the overall meaning. しかしながら will primarily appear at the beginning of a new sentence when referring back to something that has previously been stated, either by the speaker themselves or by another. As しかしながら is primarily used as an emphasized version of しかし, which itself is formal, しかしながら will primarily be seen in literature, or in formal spoken language.",N2
しかない,しかない,,"Have no choice but, Only, Just","しかない is a commonly used expression in Japanese that is partnered with verbs. It is a combination of しか, the adverbial particle , and the い-Adjective ない. This structure may be translated as 'to have no choice but (A)', or 'there is only (A)'. しかない regularly emphasizes the point that nothing apart from (A) is possible. To use しかない , simply attach it directly to the non-past form of whichever verb you would like to highlight as being the 'only' possible action. Unlike だけ, which implies that one particular option was chosen (out of several), しか always insinuates that (A) is the only option, and therefore will sound much stronger than だけ. Also, as only one option exists, it will often be assumed by the listener that some particular circumstances resulted in (A) being all that can be done. Fun Fact Occasionally, しかない may be used in manga, anime, or other forms of media that use casual language. In these cases, it is not uncommon to see しか abbreviated to っきゃ, resulting in っきゃない. However, this is not a common abbreviation in daily language.",N3
しかも,しかも,,"Moreover, Furthermore","しかも is a conjunction in Japanese which is commonly translated as either 'furthermore', or 'moreover'. This is a somewhat formal grammar pattern which indicates that both (A) and (B) exist at the same time, or are in unison. しかも itself focuses on the overall topic, so will be used for giving objective opinions, such as observable facts, rather than personal opinions. As しかも is a conjunction, it may be used between two phrases, or sometimes at the beginning of a second sentence, when referring back to the first. Often, (A) will be considered the 'base' information, while (B) is extra information added on top of (A), or further explaining (A). Fun-fact Originally, しかも came from the combination of the archaic interjection 然 'as such', or 'like that', and the particle も 'too', or 'also'. In this way, some reflection can be seen between it and modern English phrases like 'additionally', where the (B) information is simply adding on to what is already known about (A). Fun-fact In modern writing, しかも may also appear as either 而 も or 併 も , although both are quite rare.",N2
しか～ない,しか～ない,,"There's only, Nothing but","The adverbial particle しか is often compared to だけ , in that it also expresses 'only'. However, unlike だけ , しか can only be used in negative statements . Due to this, しか～ない is regularly translated as 'there's only (A)', or 'there's nothing but (A)'. しか～ない may be used to express numbers, or nouns. In this lesson we will examine nouns. Like しか～ない , the construction used for expressing numbers, when used before a noun, this expression will mean that nothing apart from that one 'thing' exists. Any verb may be used after しか , but it must be in its ない (or ありません) form. Caution When しかない directly follows a verb, the translation is a little bit different, and means that 'nothing apart from (A) can be done'. This is a separate grammar point that we will study a bit later.",N4
従って,したがって,,"Therefore, Thus, As a result","When used as a conjunction, the う-Verb 従 う 'to comply' in its て-form will indicate that something is 'following on from (A), (B)', or 'as a result of (A), (B)'. As 従 う highlights something that 'obeys with (A)', this construction will only be used to show a logical conclusion that is caused by (A). A typical pattern where 従 って will be seen, is two sentences in which the first expresses a cause, and the second begins with 従 って and then lists the logical result. This is a fairly formal grammar pattern, so is more likely to be encountered in more formal speech or writing.",N2
し,し～し,,"And, Giving reasons","Like て , し is a conjunction particle . This means that it is used for linking the (A) and (B) parts of a sentence, and describing that link in some way. The 'description' that し will highlight is 'reasons'. Regularly it is translated simply as 'and'. し may be connected to the end of almost any word, but will require a だ before it when it comes after nouns or な-Adjectives . し will follow every 'reason' that is being listed in a sentence. However, the last し may be replaced with から or ので , before the 'result' is stated. Using し will indicate that each 'reason' being listed is of equal weight/importance. Because of this, it would not be appropriate to use in sentences where one of the reasons clearly far outweighs everything else. Fun Fact In all of its uses, し indicates things that are 矛盾 無 く 共存 する, which basically means 'things that coexist, without contradicting each other'. This is the primary reason why each thing listed must be of equal importance (in terms of the overall story that the speaker is trying to convey).",N4
じゃあるまいし,じゃあるまいし,,"You are not ~ so..., it isn't ~ so...","じゃ or ではあるまいし is an expression which can be translated in a similar way to 'it is not (A), so it is not (B)', or 'you are not (A), so you can't (B)', and is often used for criticism of something acting in a way that is not befitting of it. まい is an auxiliary verb which highlights negative-volitional statements. This means that it has a similar meaning to ないだろう. Due to this, the combination of では, the う-Verb ある 'to be', まい 'not as if', and し, the particle that highlights reasons, all combine to have a literal meaning of 'it is not as if it's (A), so therefore (B)'. じゃあるまいし will be used after nouns, or phrases that have been nominalized with something like の. The statement that follows じゃあるまいし will state the speaker's opinion in relation to (A), and will almost always be negative.",N1
じゃないか,じゃないか,,"Isn't it?, Is it not?","When learning じゃない and ではない , we briefly mentioned that these constructions are regularly partnered with the particle か , in order to form a (usually casual) question. In this lesson, we will further explore this usage. Unlike じゃない and ではない (which need to come after a noun or な-Adjective ), じゃないか is able to be attached to the end of almost any phrase, to indicate a question. This is very similar to finishing a sentence with 'isn't it?' in English. When じゃないか is too casual, ではないか will be used instead. Despite being more formal, this may sound a bit stiff at times, so is best only used when politeness is expected.",N4
じゃない,じゃない,v-unspec,"Is not, Isn't","じゃない is the casual form of ではない . では is regularly contracted to じゃ in Japanese, so is worth remembering as its own structure. じゃない (casual), or ではない (semi-polite) are the structures used for creating the negative form of nouns and な-Adjectives . These structures are simply added to the base form of the noun or な-Adjective . じゃ and では can also be used with the negative ます form of ある , to create the polite variant. ない is sometimes said/written as ね or ねえ . However, this is considered very casual, or even a bit rough. Accordingly, it is best avoided in most conversations. Caution じゃない is used very frequently to ask questions. This is similar to じゃないか , a grammar point covered in another lesson. However, the nuance difference is that じゃない as a question is a little bit more blunt, like 'isn't it?' in English. On the other hand, じゃないか is more like 'don't you think?'. When じゃない is used as a question, it will usually be obvious, due to a rising tone.",N5
じゃなかった,じゃなかった,v-unspec,"Was not, Wasn't","じゃなかった is the casual form of ではなかった . では itself is regularly contracted to じゃ in Japanese, so is worth remembering as its own structure. じゃなかった (casual), or ではなかった (semi-polite) are the structures used for creating the negative-past form of nouns and な-Adjectives . Either じゃなかった or ではなかった will simply be added to the base form of a noun or な-Adjective . じゃ and では may also be used with the negative-past ます form of ある , to create the polite variant.",N5
好き,好き,n,"Like, Fond of","好 き , meaning 'to like', is one of the very common な-Adjectives in Japanese that is used in many different expressions. All な-Adjectives behave similarly to verbs, in that their form changes depending on what comes after them. For 好 き , it will be followed by な when acting as an adjective, or one of either だ or the more polite です when acting as a noun. This distinction is made depending on whether it is linked to another noun, or is independent. In the example with だ, 好 き is expressing that the thing is 'likable' (assertion). However, in the example with な , 好 き is expressing 'likability' as a quality of the noun it is attached to. Caution 好 き is considered quite a strong adjective in Japanese when it is directed towards people, so it may be interpreted as romantic interest. 大 好 き is often translated as 'love'.",N5
過ぎる,すぎる,v-unspec,"Too much, Very","すぎる is a verb that is used in Japanese to mean 'to exceed', or 'to go past'. It keeps this meaning when it is attached to other words, and creates the Japanese equivalent of saying that something is 'too much'. すぎる can be joined to the ます stem of verbs, the stem form of い-Adjectives (simply remove the い), or the stem form of な-Adjectives (simply remove the な ). With すぎる , the る is regularly omitted, with すぎ being used by itself. This is a casual language pattern, and something you will hear all the time. This variation may be used with any word that すぎる would usually be used with. There are a few rules that you will need to be careful about when using すぎる . The first of these unique rules is using すぎる with ない . When linked to ない , the い changes to さ, creating the structure なさすぎる . This means 'too much not (A)', or more naturally in English 'not enough (A)'. As with regular ない forms, では or じゃ will be required when used after な-Adjectives . In the third example here, we can see that the さ has been omitted. This is technically not correct Japanese, but has become very common among young people, so it still sounds natural. The second unique rule is when using すぎる with いい to mean 'too good'. Because すぎる is used with the stem form of い-Adjectives , you will need to remember that the stem form of いい is not actually い, but よ. This means that よすぎる would be correct, while いすぎる is not. Caution Because すぎる itself is a verb, it can also appear in the negative form, this confuses a lot of learners, and is something that needs to be practiced. Let's have a look at all of the ways that すぎる could possibly appear with ない . Because the meaning is different in each one of these sentences, depending on where the ない is, and how many ない 's there are, you may need to be careful while reading these, until it starts to feel natural.",N5
少なくない,すくなくない,,"Quite a few, Quite a lot, Many, Not a few, Not a little","Another expression that utilizes the 少 kanji (meaning 'few'), in its い-Adjective form, is 少 なくない . This is an example of a double negative in Japanese, as 少 ない 'a few' is being negated in 少 なくない . Therefore, the meaning is 'not a few', and translates more closely to 'quite a few', or 'quite a lot'. To use this expression, simply pair a noun with は , が , or も , and then follow it with 少 なくない (or 少 なくありません ). Caution The ない in 少 ない is not the い-Adjective ない, but part of the word 少 ない itself. There are several い-Adjectives like this in Japanese, and they will need to be remembered.",N4
少しも～ない,すこしも～ない,,"Not even a little, Not at all, Not in the least, Never","Coming from the word 少 し (a little bit), すこしも～ない is an expression which translates almost exactly to 'not even a little bit (A)' in English. Due to this, it indicates that there is 'no (A)', '(A) never happens', or 'not (A) at all', depending on whether a verb or an adjective is the word that is being negated. すこしも can come at the beginning of the sentence, or directly before the word/statement it is referring to. Fun Fact This construction is another example of how the も particle expresses that the word before it is surprising in some way, or unexpected. This was briefly discussed in the Number + も grammar point. Here we can see that も is highlighting 少 し as being 'surprising'. This is where the 'not even!' meaning comes from.",N4
既に,すでに,,"Already, Too late","As a formal alternative to もう, the adverb 既 に is used in Japanese as 'already'. Usually, 既 に will come at the beginning of a phrase that it is clarifying as being 'already (A)'. すでに has several nuances in Japanese beyond just 'already', let's take a look at a few of these possibilities: のこらず - Nothing remaining. あまねく - All around. ことごとく - Altogether. もはや - Already. まぎれもなく - Beyond doubt. These may all seem quite different, but together they show the full meaning of 既 に very clearly. That meaning is 'to be completely unchanging'. Let's take a look at how すでに can be used with each of these nuances. Caution Due to 既 に implying something absolutely cannot be changed, it is often used to imply that something is 'too late', and that nothing else can be done about it.",N3
すら,すら,,Even,"すら is an adverbial particle in Japanese that basically translates as 'even'. The primary difference between it and も is that すら tends to present far more extreme examples to which a specific rule applies, and therefore also applies to all other less extreme examples. In most cases すら will be used with a negative nuance. As すら is an adverbial particle, it will be seen directly after nouns, or nouns followed by case-marking particles. すら may also be followed by も in order to emphasize the point even further. Caution すら and さえ are relatively similar in terms of strength. However, すら is more formal and cannot be used in the さえ～ば construction. すら also tends to be the most extreme example from within a large group, while さえ places more emphasis on a specific individual. Fun Fact は, も, さえ, and すら are all adverbial particles that share a linear relationship in regards to the way that they are used. This relationship refers to the intensity of how (A) fits into a group. This can be imagined as follows. (A) は - (A) is as expected, and there is nothing surprising about it. (A) も - (A) also fits the category of the main topic (は), but may or may not be surprising. (A) さえ - (A) also fits the category of the main topic (は), but is quite surprising when examined individually. (A) すら - (A) also fits the category of the main topic (は), but is the most extreme example possible, thus implying that anything below that level also applies.",N1
すると,すると,,"Having done..., If...is done..., (And/just) then, Thereupon, If so","すると , a combination of する and the conjunction particle と, is generally considered to be an abbreviation of そうすると , and means that 'once (A) is done, (B)', or 'upon (A), (B)'. すると is usually used at the beginning of a new sentence, to highlight something that occurred due to the circumstances mentioned in the previous sentence/statement. As a standalone statement, すると is classified as a conjunction . Caution The 'result' that すると conveys, should always be one of two specific things. Something that the speaker has no control over, or a conclusion/determination that the speaker wants to confirm is correct (based on their understanding of the previous statement). When すると is used to draw a conclusion about another person's statement, the translation is closer to 'so you mean to say (A)', or 'if so, then (A)'.",N3
する,する,v-unspec,"To do, To make into","する verbs are one of only two main verbs in Japanese that do not follow the standard rules of conjugation for Godan and Ichidan verbs. The other primary verb being 来 る . する means to do something, or to make something a certain way. する will almost always have the particle を attached to the thing that is being done (depending on the form of the verb). The reason that する verbs are called さ-column irregular conjugation verbs in Japanese is because the る in する does not conjugate, but is dropped. This will leave す to be the part that conjugates. Because of this, する has qualities of both る-Verbs (the る being dropped), and う-Verbs (the remaining す changing, depending on the conjugation). Here are some examples of how する changes. （さ）せる , （し）ます , （す）る , （せ）よ . We will learn more about each of these conjugations of する , and their individual meanings at a later stage. For now, let's take a look at the polite します conjugation. In a broader sense, する can be thought of as meaning 'to do something that has an external effect'.",N5
ずくめ,ずくめ,,"Completely, Entirely, All in, Nothing but, A real streak of, Without exception, Jet","Originally stemming from the suffix use of 尽 く 'completely', or 'using solely', and the addition of め, ずくめ came to be preferentially written as hiragana, with ず replacing づ. This structure may be translated as 'completely (A)', 'all in (A)', or 'nothing but (A)'. Generally, it is attached directly to nouns, and expresses that (A) is to such an extent that nothing apart from (A) can be seen, felt, or noticed. In cases where ずくめ will directly modify the following noun, の will come between ずくめ and that noun. Although づくめ may occasionally be seen in older literature, it is mostly considered incorrect kana usage these days. While ずくめ may be used in either positive or negative contexts, it is mainly seen in set expressions, so is best used with combinations that you have already heard or read. Fun Fact 尽 くし is another older structure that is used to express things that are separate, but are grouped together. This is usually translated as 'all sorts of (A)', or 'all kinds of (A)'. It is the conjunctive form of the う-Verb 尽 くす 'to be exhaustive' with a voiced pronunciation of the つ.",N1
ずじまい,ずじまい,,"Ended up not, Did not (in the end), Never did","ずじまい is a grammar structure that combines the literary form of the classical auxiliary verb ぬ, ず 'not', and the voiced conjunctive form of the う-Verb しまう 'to finish', or 'to bring to a close', じまい. Like しまう, ずじまい will often indicate regret at something ending up a certain way. However, this regret is about '(A) not happening', due to the negation provided by ず. This structure will be used following the indeterminate form of verbs. Common translations include 'to end up not (A)', and 'to not have done (A) in the end'. ずじまい will often be followed by だった or でした, indicating that (A) was not something that turned out happening, despite the wishes or intentions of the doer. Caution As is always the case with ず, する will be altered to せず.",N1
ずっと,ずっと,,"Continuously, All throughout, Entire time, Ever (since), The whole time, All the way","The adverb ずっと has two primary meanings in Japanese. The first is that something keeps going in a constant state, without ever stopping/resting, and the second is to emphasize an amount of something. We will examine the first meaning in this lesson. To use ずっと , add it to the beginning of the phrase that you want to highlight as being ongoing. Alternatively, ずっと can be used after から , to express that something has been continuing 'ever since' some specific event/point in time. Fun Fact ずっと literally means that something is 'unwavering', or 'unfaltering'. Due to this, the statement that ずっと is attached to will always be perceived as being 'far more (A)', or 'to the maximum amount possible for (A)', regardless of whether it is highlighting a noun, verb, or an adjective.",N4
ずっと,ずっと,,"By far, Way, Far...er, Far...more","In addition to the ずっと used to mean 'always', or 'non-stop', this adverb may also convey that one thing is 'by far (A)', or 'much more (A)' than something else. In these phrases, ずっと usually comes at the beginning of the sentence, before some form of comparison will be made between (A) and (B). Fun Fact Although ずっと as 'ever since', or 'always' may seem quite different to ずっと as 'way more', or 'by far', the literal meanings are actually exactly the same. In all cases, ずっと simply highlights 'an extremely big interval'.",N3
ずつ,～ずつ,,"One at a time, Per, Each, Gradually","ずつ , or 宛 in its kanji form, is a suffix in Japanese that is used to highlight things that occur/exist in specific amounts. It is often translated simply as 'each', 'per', or 'at a time'. Depending on the source, ずつ may also be considered to be an adverbial particle . However, this will not change the way that it is utilized. ずつ is used directly after the number/amount of something that it is highlighting as being the 'at a time' grouping. Fun Fact The kanji, 宛 , literally means 'allotment', and refers to distinct groupings. It is regularly used in reference to where people live (their address being considered their 'allotment'). In these cases though, it has the reading 宛 . For ずつ , 'allotment' may also be used as an accurate translation in almost all situations.",N3
ずとも,ずとも,exp,"Even if not, Without, Don't have to","When combined with the classical auxiliary verb ず (used for negation), the conjunction particle とも 'even if' implies that regardless of the hypothetical situation of (A), (B) still applies. This often translates as 'even if not (A), (B)', or 'don't have to (A) to (B)'. ずとも will appear attached to the ない-stem of verbs. When the speaker wants to express 'not being (A)' rather than 'not doing (A)', ならずとも will follow a noun. This is simply the negated form of the う-Verb なる 'to become'. Although ずとも is a formal expression, it may occasionally be used sarcastically. Additionally, it is common for ずとも to be followed by 良 い. This can be interpreted as 'okay even if not (A)'.",N1
ずには居られない,ずにはいられない,,"Cannot help doing something, Cannot resist doing something","As mentioned in our ずに lesson, ず is an auxiliary verb that is not commonly used in modern Japanese, except for in set expressions. It has the equivalent role of ない, in expressing that something 'has not', or 'will not' happen. The case marking particle に is then combined with the adverbial particle は, and the negative-potential form of いる, いられない. ずにはいられない may be translated as 'cannot help doing (A)', or 'cannot resist doing (A)'. ずにはいられない will be attached to the indeterminate form of verbs. This is the same stem form as ない uses. Although ずにはいられない is often translated as 'cannot resist (A)', the literal meaning is simply 'cannot be without (A)'. Caution As the modern indeterminate form of する has several different forms, care will need to be taken when conjugating する verbs. While ない joins with し to create しない, ず will join with せ to create せず.",N3
ずには措かない,ずにはおかない,,"Will definitely, Will certainly, Bound to, Not fail to","ずにはおかない is a combination of the classical auxiliary verb ず, the case-marking particle に, the adverbial particle は, and the standard negated form of the う-Verb 措 く, 措 かない, ‘to set aside’, or ‘to leave as is’. It is interpreted as ‘(A) will definitely happen’, or ‘I will not fail to (A)’. This is a formal expression that literally means ‘I cannot leave it as it is with (A) undone’, and therefore indicates strong will to complete the action that is reflected in the standard translations. As this structure begins with ず, it will only be used with verbs. Alternatively, ないでは may replace ず. This will be seen as ないではおかない. However, the meaning will not change at all. Caution Due to this grammar expression showing strong will to not give up until (A) is done, it will often be used with causative verbs in (A). This indicates that the speaker is determined not to quit until they can make another person do something.",N1
ずにはすまない',ずにはすまない,,"Won't get away without, Won't get off without, Have to, Have no choice but to, Can’t not","ずにはすまない is used to indicate that one ‘has no choice but to (A)’, or ‘won’t get away without doing (A)’. It is a formal expression that is a combination of the negative classical auxiliary verb , ず, the case-marking particle に, the adverbial particle は, and the standard negated form of the う-Verb 済 む ‘to come to pass’, or ‘to finish’. Due to this, the more literal translation is ‘it will not come to pass that (A) is not done’, with the more natural English interpretations conveying the same feeling. As we can assume by this expression beginning with ず, it will exclusively follow verbs. Just like other instances where ず is used with する, ぜず will be the correct conjugation pattern. The standard (ない) negative form of a verb may also be followed by ではすまない. This has the same meaning as ずにはすまない. Caution This construction will tend to sound unnatural in cases where the speaker only considers (A) to be something that is necessary based on their personal feelings. (A) is usually something that would be the expected course of action according to anyone.",N1
ずに済む,ずに済む,,"Get by without doing something, To get away with","ずに 済 む is a grammar construction used in Japanese to indicate that one can 'get away without doing (A)', or 'it's no problem without (A)'. This structure is just a mix of ず, a literary auxiliary verb that attaches to verbs in the same way as ない (and has the same meaning), に, and 済 む, a う-Verb meaning 'to come to pass', or 'to end up'. Literally, it can be thought of as meaning 'it will work out without (A)'. As mentioned, ず connects to verbs in the same way as ない, so this structure will be seen after the verbs that they are negating. As the primary element in this grammar point that controls the meaning is 済 む, other negations such as ないですむ , or なしですむ may also be seen. 無 しで functions as a suffix , so may be used directly after nouns, unlike ないで and ずに. In most cases, (A) will be something that is thought of as unpleasant or bothersome, therefore highlighting the speaker's relief that it can be avoided.",N2
ずに,ずに,,Without doing,"Although it is not considered to be one of the primary 18 auxiliary verbs that are used in modern Japanese, ず is a classical auxiliary verb that has the same role as ぬ, and ない. This role is negating the verb that it is attached to. ずに is simply the addition of the case marking particle に to ず. Together, they mean 'without doing', in a similar way to ないで. To use ずに, attach it to the indeterminate form of the verb that you wish to express as 'without doing (A)'. This is the same form used with ない. ずに is quite a bit more formal than ないで, but still frequently used in modern Japanese. Especially as part of set phrases, like ずにすむ (which we will learn about in another lesson). Caution When used with a する verb, する will become せずに, not しずに. Both せ and し are indeterminate forms of する . し, the more common form that is used in east Japan appears with ない.",N3
せいで,せいで,,"Because of, Due to, Blame","Although written almost exclusively in hiragana, せい is a noun that may be better understood from its kanji, 所為 , meaning 'doings'. せい is used to convey negative results that occurred due to the behavior or actions of another person/thing. Because of this, common translations of せい are 'fault', 'due to', or 'because of'. As せい is a noun, it may be used after the attributive form of any other word. The case marking particle で will also regularly be seen after せい, especially when conveying the (B) result that occurred 'with' or 'by means of' those 'doings'. Fun Fact The 'doings' that 所為 represents is similar to the negative 'doings' that is used in English to place blame. This can be seen in phrases such as 'it was the weather's doings', or 'ah, so the missing cookies were your doings!'",N3
折角,折角,,"With trouble, At great pains, Take the trouble, Might as well..., Rare/long-awaited occasion","折角（せっかく) is an idiomatic adverb that is often used to express doing something 'with trouble', 'at great pains', or 'to be a rare/long-awaited occasion'. Being an adverb that often modifies the meaning of a whole sentence, it will commonly appear at the beginning of a statement. When 折角 is nominating an event as being long awaited, it will appear directly before the event, separated only by the case marking particle の. Fun Fact There are several guesses for where 折角 originates. One of the most common is that it is an abbreviation for 頭巾 の 角 を 折 る 'to fold the horn (tail) of a hood'. This was something that a famous confucian did intentionally to protect his hood from getting wet in the rain. The people of the time started to copy the act, and 折角 also came to be used as an idiom to mean 'intentionally', or 'to go out of one's way to do something'.",N3
せめて,せめて,,At least,"Coming from the verb 責 める, meaning to have the 'onus to do (A)', せめて is an adverb that indicates that doing (A) is the minimum expected in order to achieve some desired outcome. It is often translated simply as 'at least' in English. せめて usually alters the meaning of an entire phrase, and will appear at the beginning of sentences. Stemming from 責 める, this structure usually implies that there is some sort of onus or responsibility to do (A), rather than (A) simply being a minimum amount. Due to this, it is often used with grammar points that express desire or opinions such as たい, ほしい, てほしい, べき, and others.",N2
全然,ぜんぜん,,(Not) at all,"In Japanese, there are several adverbs that are traditionally used exclusively with negative expressions (containing ない). 全然 is one of them. When used at the beginning of a ない (or ません) containing phrase, 全然（ぜんぜん) has the meaning of 'completely not (A)', or 'not (A) at all'. In writing, it is equally as natural to use either 全然 as kanji, or hiragana only, so both forms may be used confidently. ぜんぜん is more flexible (and friendly sounding) in casual conversation than 全 く , a similar expression which has a formal (often negative) nuance. While both of these sentences have the meaning of 'not (A) at all', まったく could give the listener the impression that you are not pleased with the situation. This will depend quite a bit on tone of voice, though. Caution Despite originally being used only with negative expressions, it is becoming more and more common for ぜんぜん to appear with positive expressions as well. In these cases, it just has the meaning of 'totally (A)', or 'completely (A)'. Although this is technically not grammatically correct, it is becoming so frequently used that it is considered correct by most people (especially the younger generation).",N4
そういう,そういう,,"Like that, Kind of","Coming from the こそあど 言葉 family of words, こう , そう , ああ , or どう may be used with the verb 言 う to form an expression which literally means 'in the way of (A)'. (A) being 'this' これ , 'that' それ , 'that over there' あれ , or 'what' どれ (in questions). As with all pre-noun adjectival words, this expression will be used directly before a noun. Although こう , そう , ああ , and どう share a relationship with これ , それ , あれ , and どれ , they are their own individual words, which each have a meaning similar to 'as such'. These words are all adverb when used by themselves. Caution そう (the adverb), should not be confused with そう , the auxiliary verb. そう (the adverb) comes from the kanji 然 う , while the auxiliary verb does not have a kanji form.",N4
そういえば,そういえば,,"Speaking of which, By the way, Come to think of it","そういえば is a hypothetical structure in Japanese consisting of the adverb そう 'like that', and the ば conjunctive form of the う-Verb 言 う 'to say'. Common translations include 'speaking of which', 'by the way', and 'come to think of it'. These translations are actually very close to the literal translation of 'if saying that' in that they all refer back to the previous statement as being a trigger for bringing up a topic that the speaker wants to discuss. そういえば will primarily appear at the beginning of sentences, before the speaker will then bring up the topic that they were reminded of. Caution Due to そういえば refering to something that has already been brought up over the course of a conversation, it will not be used to move on to completely unrelated topics in the same way that phrases like 'by the way' are used in English. Fun-fact そういえば is very similar in the way it is used to といえば, with そう simply replacing the direct quotation of と. Many textbooks will list both as a single grammar point, despite そういえば itself basically being a set phrase.",N2
そうすると,そうすると,,"Having done that..., If that is done..., (And/just) then, Thereupon, If so","そうすると , a combination of 然 う (an adverb meaning 'like that', or 'as such') する and the conjunction particle と, expresses that 'once (A) was done, (B)', or 'upon (A), (B)'. そうすると is usually used at the beginning of a new sentence, to highlight something that occurred due to the circumstances mentioned in the previous sentence/statement. As a stand-alone statement, そうすると is classified as a conjunction . Caution The 'result' that そうすると conveys, should always be one of two specific things. Something that the speaker has no control over, or a conclusion/determination that the speaker wants to confirm is correct (based on their understanding of the previous statement). When そうすると is used to draw a conclusion about another person's statement, the translation is closer to 'so you mean to say (A)', or 'if so, then (A)'. Fun Fact Although 然 う has a kanji form, this particular word will almost always be written in hiragana. This is true for many different expressions that use そう, not just そうすると .",N3
そうだ,そうだ,,"I heard that, It is said that","The auxiliary verb そうだ has two primary functions in Japanese. It can convey one of the following things: Hearsay: 伝聞 - Highlighting things that have been heard from other people. Appearance: 様態 - Highlighting the way that things 'appear', or 'seem'. The appearance nuance is covered in another lesson, so we will focus on hearsay in this grammar point. When used to repeat statements that have been heard from other people/sources, そうだ (or そう です ) will be paired with the plain form of a verb or い-Adjective , or a noun/ な-Adjective followed by だ . そうだ always implies that the speaker is not 100% certain about the validity of the information that they are conveying. Due to this, it does not sound as confident as other expressions, like ようだ . Caution In order to avoid confusion between the そうだ that is used for repeating information, and the そうだ that is used for making observations, the following differences will need to be memorized. Verbs - 降 るそうだ - Unaltered verb, そうだ that is repeating information. 降 りそうだ - Conjunctive form , そうだ that is used for making observations. い-Adjectives - 寒 いそうだ - Unaltered adjective, そうだ that is repeating information. 寒 そうだ - い removed, そうだ that is used for making observations. Nouns and な-Adjectives - 綺麗 だそうだ - だ  is used before そうだ. This is repeating information. 綺麗 そうだ - No だ between the な-Adjective and そうだ. This is making an observation.",N3
そうにない,そうにない,,"Unlikely to, Showing no signs of","Compared to そうもない 'very unlikely to (A)', そうにない is a grammar structure that has a very similar meaning, but is not quite as emphasized. In this expression, も will be replaced with に. Also, apart from indicating that something is very unlikely, it may also indicate that something is showing 'no signs of (A)'. そうにない will connect to the ます-stem of the verb that it is indicating as being very unlikely. Occasionally, そうにもない may also appear, and has the strongest nuance of being unlikely to happen amongst そうにない , そうもない , and そうにもない . Note that the only difference between these three structures is the addition, subtraction, or combination of the に and も particles. As this structure is just an extension of the use of the auxiliary verb そう (used primarily for speculation, or hearsay), it is simply indicating that (A) does not have any appearance of occuring.",N2
そうに,そうに・そうな,,"Seem, Look like, Sound","そうだ is one of the 18 auxiliary verbs in Japanese, and can be used in the same way as な-Adjectives (may be followed by な when acting as an adjective, or に when acting as an adverb). This is a unique characteristic of そうだ and ようだ . It is not something that can be done with all auxiliary verbs . As with そうだ , そうに and そうな carry the meaning of 'seeming like (A)', or 'looking like (A)'. Caution そう may also be used when attached to the い-Adjective , ない. In this case, there is a unique conjugation rule which you will need to be careful of. As always, い will be removed from ない before attaching そう . However, さ will need to be inserted between な, and そう . This results in the construction なさそう. Note that this addition of さ does not happen with verbs. This is due to the ない that is used with negative verbs being an auxiliary verb ,  and not an い-Adjective . With the auxiliary verb ない, simply remove the い, before adding そう directly to the stem.",N4
そうもない,そうもない,,"Very unlikely to, Does not seem that, Does not appear that","そうもない is an expression used with verbs in Japanese, to indicate that some particular action is very unlikely. It is a combination of the auxiliary verb そう, the adverbial particle も, and the い-Adjective ない. To recap, one of the primary uses of そう is to highlight appearance . Therefore, そうもない literally means 'to not even appear like (A)'. This structure will be used after verbs in their conjunctive form . Caution そうもない is very similar to そうにない. The primary difference being that そうもない is stronger. This is due to も expressing something that is surprising (or for emphasis), while に simply marks a location (or state) within which something does or does not exist. The difference can be understood as follows: (A) そうもない - To not even look like (A), where 'even' emphasizes (A). (A) そうにない - To not be looking like (A), where 'be' marks where (A) is 'not' existing. Caution そうもない is an expression that is very commonly used with potential verbs, in order to convey that the 'possibility' of something cannot be observed. While this translates as 'to not appear as if (A) can be done', realistically it comes across quite strongly, similar to 'to not stand a chance of doing (A)'.",N3
そう,そう,,"Look like, Appear, Seem, Have a feeling that","そうだ is one of the 18 primary auxiliary verbs in Japanese, and can be used in two (2) different ways. The broad meaning in each of its applications is that something 'seems' to be a certain way. Due to this, そう is regularly translated as 'seems like', 'looks like', or 'appears as though'. In this lesson, we will focus on the form that is used with the conjunctive (stem) form of words. Please examine the structure guide to see these forms. Caution そう may also be used when attached to the い-Adjective , ない. In this case, there is a unique conjugation rule which we will need to be careful of. As always, い will be removed from ない before attaching そう . However, さ will be inserted between な, and そう . This creates the expression なさそう. Note that this addition of さ does not happen with verbs. This is due to the ない that is used with negative verbs being an auxiliary verb ,  and not an い-Adjective . With the auxiliary verb ない, simply remove the い, before adding そう directly to the stem. Caution This そう is utilized exclusively to make predictions/guesses about something based on visual information. It is relatively low confidence, so should not be used for things that are obvious. In these cases, みたい would be used instead.",N4
そこで,そこで,,"Accordingly, Now, Therefore, To that end","そこで (very rarely seen as 其処 で) is a combination of そこ 'there', and the case marking particle で . It is often translated as 'to that end', or 'accordingly'. Literally, it just means 'at that place', with で 's use as 'with' or 'by' highlighting that something will be done there ('there' often being a situation). This phrase behaves very similarly to 'as such' in English. Usually, a first sentence will highlight what the 'situation' is, before そこで goes on to explain how that situation was or will be resolved. As で implies the 'use' of something, this expression should only highlight actions that are controllable.",N3
そこ,そこ,n,"There, That place","そこ is one of the forms of the それ family of words used to identify things close to the listener. In this case it demonstrates a place. Just like それ represents 'that', そこ represents 'that place', or simply 'there'. In the same way that それ can be used to point back to something that was mentioned previously, そこ can be used to point back to a place that was mentioned previously. Caution そこ should not be confused with そっち, a similar word which is also sometimes translated as 'there'. そっち focuses more on the direction that one is/is going, while そこ focuses purely on 'that place'.",N5
その為に,そのため(に),,"For that reason, Because of that, To that end","そのために is a frequently used conjunction in Japanese that utilizes その , the noun ため 'reason' (occasionally seen as 為 ), and the case marking particle に . そのために is most commonly translated as 'for that reason', or 'to that end'. そのために will be used at the beginning of a new sentence, to highlight something that will be done/occur due to the circumstances/goal of something in the first sentence. に is often omitted. Caution ため is very similar to 'sake' in English, and tends to be used far more frequently when referring to goals/positive outcomes, than it is for negative outcomes. However, it may still occasionally be used in negative circumstances, to highlight their (unfortunate) result. Fun Fact 為 is an exceptionally flexible kanji in Japanese. In addition to ため it is occasionally used for する 'to do', なる 'to become', なす 'to bring about', and つくる 'to make'. The kanji itself means 'to put (something) to use', with heavy emphasis on whatever new state/result will be arrived at afterwards. This meaning can be seen reflected in all of 為 's readings.",N3
その上,その上,,"Besides, In addition, Furthermore","その 上 is a formal expression used in Japanese to indicate that something is 'besides', 'in addition to', or 'furthermore' in relation to the previous statement. It primarily comes at the beginning of sentences before reflecting back on and adding new information in regard to what has already been said. The literal meaning can be thought of as 'on top of that (B)', where 'that' is the information that has already been mentioned. Despite often being used in formal settings, it is not uncommon to hear this phrase used in daily speech, due to its simplicity in highlighting something being 'in addition'.",N2
その結果,その結果,,As a result,"その 結果 is a conjunction in Japanese that is used to highlight the result of something that has been previously said. The noun 結果 itself means 'result'. This expression translates as 'as a result of (A)', or 'resulting from (A)'. その 結果 will be used at the beginning of a new sentence, before a (B) phrase will highlight the result of (A). その 結果 may be used to highlight either positive, or negative results interchangeably. However, the (B) part of the sentence almost always focuses on a new 'situation' or 'condition' that has been created due to (A).",N3
その,その,adj-na,That,"その is classified as a ' pre-noun adjectival ' in Japanese. These are a special type of word that do not conjugate. This means that they will always appear in the same form. その comes from the same family of words as それ and そこ , and is used to identify a 'thing' that is near the listener. As the name ' pre-noun adjectival ' suggests, these words will always appear before a noun, and describe that noun in some way.",N5
そばから,そばから,,"As soon as, Right after, Even if … still","そばから is a combination of the noun 側 'side', and the case marking particle から 'from'. It illustrates something that happens immediately upon (A), and can be translated as 'as soon as (A), (B)', or 'right after (A), (B)'. (B) is usually something that is considered annoying, unfavorable, or somehow nullifies (A) by the speaker, but there are exceptions. If the more literal translation of 'from right beside (A), (B)' helps to remember the nuance of (B) happening straight away, then that may be a helpful way to memorize this construction. そばから will follow verbs in either their dictionary or past-tense forms. Regardless of whether the dictionary or the past-tense form of a verb is used, as そばから means 'right after (A)', the meaning will not change at all. Caution そばから will almost always imply that (B) is something that always happens upon (A), rather than being a once-off situation.",N1
それぞれ,それぞれ,,"Each, Respectively","それぞれ is a noun in Japanese that is used similarly to 'each' in English. Like other nouns that can be used adverbially ( ほとんど , 沢山 , and かなり for example), それぞれ regularly comes before a whole sentence, or before a specific noun preceded by の. Fun Fact それぞれ comes from the same kanji as 其 , the word used to highlight 'that' (close to the listener) in Japanese. Due to this, the literal meaning of それぞれ is 'that and that' (interpreted simply as 'everyone', or 'each).",N3
それでも,それでも,,"But still, And yet, Even so, Nevertheless","それでも is a combination of the pronoun それ , and the adverbial particle でも . It is often translated simply as 'even so', or 'nevertheless'. Literally, it is a bit closer to 'even with that'. それでも is usually used between an (A) and a (B) phrase, to show that there is more information (usually surprising) to be considered. This grammar point primarily expresses that 'even with' what has been said previously, it is not all there is to think about.",N4
それで,それで,,"Because of that, So?, And then?, Therefore, With that","Like それに , それで is another conjunction that is regularly considered to be one word in Japanese, but is more correctly just a combination of the pronoun それ , and the case marking particle で . The thing that それ is 'substituting' for is the entire clause/sentence that came before it, while で highlights that 'with that', or 'by means of that'. In this way, it translates to 'therefore', 'because of that', or 'with that' where 'that' is the previous information. それで is frequently used at the beginning of a second sentence, to highlight the information from the first. Caution You may also see それでは . で in this case is the conjunctive form of だ (the auxiliary verb). Due to this, the meaning is closer to 'well then', 'in that case', or 'if so'. This では is also frequently shortened to じゃ .",N4
それとも,それとも,,"Or, Or else, Rather","それとも is a conjunction in Japanese that may be translated as 'or', or 'otherwise'. It is used to highlight alternative options or choices between (A) and (B). それとも is a combination of それ, and the particles と, and も. This grammar structure will only be used when the options are limited to either (A), or (B). それとも will appear either after a comma, or at the beginning of new sentences. In many cases, (A) and (B) will be opposites of each other. However, this is not a requirement for using それとも .",N2
それなのに,それなのに,,"And yet, Despite this","Being a combination of the substitute noun それ, な, and のに, the particle meaning 'although' or 'despite', それなのに acts as a conjunction meaning 'and yet', or 'despite that', and simply refers back to the previous statement made, when the following statement is in contradiction to it. Due to its use as a conjunction, それなのに will primarily appear at the beginning of a new sentence. Being that the (B) sentence is in contradiction to the (A) sentence, それなのに will often indicate something that is unexpected, or was somehow unpredictable based on (A).",N2
それなら,それなら,,"Then, If that's the case","Acting as a conjunction , それなら is a structure used for highlighting that if the previous statement is the case, then (B) will probably also be true, or will need to be considered. それなら may be interpreted as 'if that's the case, then (B)'. それなら is most often used when replying to some statement that the speaker has just heard from another person. In these cases, it will come before some sort of guess, suggestion, or consideration about what the speaker has just heard. だったら and それだったら may also be seen, and carry the same meaning.",N2
それにしても,それにしても,,"Nevertheless, Even so","それにしても is an expression used in Japanese as an extension of にしても 'even though', or 'even if'. This grammar pattern may be translated as 'nevertheless', or 'even so', and merely points out that despite what was said previously, the speaker's primary opinion is the following statement. In most cases, それにしても simply highlights that while the speaker accepts or acknowledges the previous statement as true, that is not all there is to be considered. それにしても will primarily appear at the beginning of sentences, or directly after a comma. Due to それにしても being used when the speaker is already aware of or accepts the situation of (A), (B) will frequently highlight something that is above or beyond that expectation.",N2
それに,それに,,"And, Besides, Moreover, In addition","The conjunction それに is regularly considered to be one word in Japanese, but is more correctly just a combination of the pronoun それ , and the case marking particle に . The thing that それ is 'substituting' for is the entire clause/sentence that came before it, while に highlights that extra information is about to be added. In this way, it translates to 'and to that', or 'and on that', where 'that' is the previous information. Often, it is translated simply as 'moreover', 'in addition', or 'and'. Because それに is 'adding' information with に , the (B) information itself must be something that would logically happen 'in addition to (A)', or 'as a result of (A)'. Therefore, それに will highlight something that has either all positive, or all negative connotations. Never both.",N4
それまでだ…,それまでだ,,"If… then it is all in vain, It's done, It is useless, No point, It is a waste, That's it, It is all gone,","ばそれまでだ is a hypothetical expression used when one wishes to indicate that ‘if (A) is reached, that’s as far as it will go’. This usually indicates that everything up to that point will unfortunately go to waste. Standard translations include ‘if (A), then it’s all been in vain’, ‘if (A), then all is a waste’, or ‘if (A), then there’s no point. Although verbs combining with the conjunction particle ば is the standard form of this grammar structure. The conjunction particle たら may also occasionally be used. Frequently this grammar structure will be seen in sentences that include ても or でも in the first half, with ばそれまでだ coming closer to the end. This indicates that ‘even if (A), if also (B), then there’s no point’. Caution と 言 われればそれまでだ is a set expression that means ‘while it is true that (A), (B)’, or ‘although certainly (A), (B)’. It is often used for politely expressing one’s personal opinion in relation to something. This phrase literally means ‘if It were to be said that it was (A), then that’s all there is to it, but (B)’.",N1
それ,それ,n,That,"Just like これ , それ is considered to be a pronoun in Japanese (more accurately it is a substitute noun ). それ translates roughly to 'that' and highlights something that is closer to the listener (physically or emotionally) than the speaker. In these sentences, we can see それ highlighting things that the speaker is identifying as being closer to the listener, or about the listener. それ is also used to point back to things that have been mentioned previously in the conversation. This can be something that was said earlier within the same sentence, or something that someone else said.",N5
そんなに,そんなに,,"So (much), That much, Like that","そんなに , like そんな , is one of the most common ways to express that one thing is 'like' something else in casual conversation. The addition of the particle に just highlights そんな as being the 'destination' of the 'like' amount. This construction is regularly translated as 'so much', 'that much', or simply 'like that'. As a word, そんなに is used adverbially. This means that it may come before any verb, い-Adjective , or な-Adjective . Almost any そんなに based sentence can be translated literally as 'to an extent like (A)', where (A) is the word that comes after そんなに , and に indicates 'to'. As そんなに is another example of こそあど 言葉 (words like これ , それ , あれ , and どれ ), it means that こんなに , あんなに , and どんなに may also be used. Despite this, そんなに is almost considered a set phrase, and is therefore the most common out of all of the possibilities (except for どんなに , which is often used when explaining/giving reasons for something).",N4
そんな,そんな・こんな・あんな・どんな,,"Such a・Kind of, Something like ~","One of the most common ways to convey that something is 'like' something else in casual conversation, is through the use of そんな , こんな , あんな , or どんな (when asking a question). These are not officially words themselves, but are abbreviations that come from その ような , この ような , あの ような , and どの ような . To use this casual expression, simply say it directly before the noun that you are describing, or enquiring about. Because these abbreviations originally come from a longer (more formal) variation, that form may also be used in situations where you would like to sound a little bit more polite.",N4
たい,たい,aux-v,Want to do,"たい is an auxiliary verb that is used to express things that you would like to do (want). To use たい , it needs to be added to the same conjugation base form of a verb that ます would be attached to. When using たい , the thing that is 'wanted' can either be marked with を , or が . The difference in nuance is that something marked with が is considered to be wanted more. たい is conjugated in the same way as い-Adjectives , meaning that the negative , past , or past-negative forms may also be used. たい is only used for expressing things that 'you' want, or repeating information/asking questions about what other people want. It may not be used to make guesses about what other people 'may' want, unless asking them directly. Caution たい is not used to tell other people that you want them to do something. This is done with ～てほしい . Caution たい is not usually used when giving invitations (asking someone if they want to do something with you). In these cases ～ませんか is far more natural.",N5
たがる,たがる,,To want to (Third person),"As we explored in our lesson about がる , this verb can be used with adjectives, to express the way in which people are acting. However, it can also be partnered with the auxiliary verb たい , to form たがる . This grammar construction is used when expressing that someone is acting like they 'want' to do something. To use this structure, attach たい to the ます stem form of any verb, then replace the い in たい with がる . Caution たがる is in contrast to てほしい which means 'to want someone to do (A)'. These differences will need to be practiced, and memorized. This is also in contrast to the い-Adjective 欲 しい 'to want (A)'. To describe that someone seems like they want something (rather than that they want to 'do' something), がる will be paired with this adjective.",N4
沢山,たくさん,n,"Many, A lot of, Plenty, Enough","There are many cases in Japanese where a noun will appear as an adverb, particularly with words that are describing amounts. たくさん , or 沢山 as it is regularly seen, is one of those words. たくさん means 'a lot', or 'many' in Japanese, and can be used before a phrase, or directly before a noun, when separated via の . Caution たくさん may be used before a noun without also using の . However, in this case, it will feel more like たくさん is describing the whole phrase, rather than just the noun it is in front of. If you strongly want to highlight the noun, using の would be best. In these examples, the only difference is that the sentence with の feels like the speaker is putting extra focus on the people, rather than the gathering that is happening.",N5
～たことがある,たことがある,exp,Have done before,"たことがある is a set expression in Japanese that is used for saying that 'there has been a time that I have done (A)'. The auxiliary verb た will be added to the verb indicating what you have done, followed by こと - が - ある . Like の , こと is regularly used for nominalization (creating a noun-like phrase). However, の cannot replace こと in this particular grammar pattern. From these examples, we can see that ない (the negative equivalent of ある ) may also be used, when you want to express that you have 'never' done something. Caution Just like English, many set phrases cannot be adjusted in Japanese (in the same way that こと cannot be swapped with の in this expression). Fun Fact In expressions where こと is followed by a verb phrase, の may not be used. When used for nominalization, の is almost always followed by a noun or adjective phrase. Here are some examples.",N5
ただ〜のみ,ただ〜のみ,,"Nothing but, Should, Have to, Only, All that remains,","ただ～のみ is an expression that is commonly interpreted as ‘(A) is all that is required’, or ‘(A) is all that remains’. It is a combination of the neologism ただ ‘merely’, and the adverbial particle のみ ‘just’ or ‘only’. のみ itself has the same meanings and uses as both だけ and ばかり, but is slightly more formal. Frequently, (A) will be a verb that indicates movement, continuation, or hope. This highlights that one has already done everything that is possible, and all that is left to do is hope for a good result, or that one is already doing all that is necessary, and all that remains is to continue. When する-Verbs are used with this expression, occasionally it will be replaced by ある. This puts more focus on the existence of the action, rather than the action itself. The replacement of する with ある is primarily literary.",N1
忽ち,たちまち,,"Immediately, Quickly, Suddenly, In a moment or flash","たちまち is an adverb in that is used to convey the feeling of something happening 'suddenly', or 'in a flash'. The primary nuance with たちまち compared to other similar structures is that たちまち indicates that something happened spontaneously, and was not able to be controlled. In many cases, たちまち will indicate something entering a new, ongoing state, or something being completed. たちまち will often appear directly before the verb phrase that it is describing as being the new state. Fun-fact たちまち originally comes from the kanji structure 忽 ち , with the kanji itself meaning 'without thought'. This nuance is kept with たちまち , as all actions associated with the word indicate a lack of planning or thought before happening. Despite this, the kanji itself is rarely used in modern writing.",N2
たったの,たった(の),,"Only, Just, No more than","たった is a common adverb in Japanese that originates from an emphasized alteration of 唯 'only', 'merely'. たった keeps the same meaning of ただ in that it just expresses that something is 'only (A)', 'just (A)', or 'no more than (A)'. This nuance is usually used when the actual number of (A) is exceptionally low compared to the speaker's expectation of anticipation. たった will often appear at the beginning of sentences, and will either modify the whole sentence, or a specific number when followed by の and then that number. As たった is an adverb that is usually used for emphasis, it often accompanies other similar grammar patterns like だけ, しか, etc. Fun-fact - The common expression ただいま 'now', or 'I'm home' may occasionally be seen in the emphasized form たったいま . This is primarily when the meaning is 'now', or 'just now' (right at this present moment), rather than 'I'm home'.",N2
たって,たって,,"Even if, Even though, No matter how","たって is a casual structure that carries the same meaning as 'ても' or 'でも', and can be used with a wide variety of words. Common translations include 'even if (A)', 'even though (A)', or 'no matter how (A)'. In the case of verbs, たって conjugates in the standard way that the た past-tense form usually would. For い-Adjectives, たって attaches to the conjugative く-form. For nouns and な-Adjectives, た will change to だ, and だって will then be used with the stem noun or adjective. Fun-fact Although たって is widely considered a casual form of ても, it originally stems from たとて, which is a combination of the auxiliary verb た, and the particle とて, which itself is thought to be an old-fashioned abbreviation of と 言 っても. In this way, the modern abbreviation of たって still reflects the original extended nuance of たと 言 っても 'even if (A) is said, (B)'.",N2
立て,たて,,"Freshly ~ed, Just ~ed","たて, coming from the verb 立 てる 'to stand' is a suffix in Japanese that is often used after the conjunctive form of verbs. たて conveys that something has 'just been finished', or is 'freshly finished'. As a suffix , たて transforms verbs into nouns. This means that they may be followed by a (B) phrase, or followed directly by the case marking particle の and a noun. Fun Fact たて is a suffix that is used to convey the moment in time directly after something has been finished, rather than the fact that it 'is' finished. Due to this, たて is most frequently used with verbs that indicate some sense of time based importance, where (A) will degrade in quality over time after completion.",N3
例えば,たとえば,,For example,"たとえば (or 例 えば in its kanji form) is an adverb in Japanese that is used at the beginning of a sentence, or an individual statement, in order to present an example. It can be translated almost directly as 'for example'. Fun Fact 例 えば should primarily be used when the 'example' that is being given is as simple as possible. If you want to explain something in further (in-depth) detail, 詳 しく 'in full' would be used as the adverb instead.",N4
たとえ〜ても,たとえ〜ても,,"Even if…is the case, Supposing that","たとえ, coming from 仮令 , an adverb meaning 'supposing that', is a word in Japanese that is often used with ても (or でも), in order to present possible circumstances, and their contradictory and/or (usually) undesirable outcomes. たとえ is primarily seen at the beginning of a sentence, before some kind of possibility, comparison, or supposition will be stated. たとえ tends to be used to present situations where 'even if (A) were true, (B) still may/may not happen'. This is called a 'contrastive' example. もし on the other hand tends to be used for examples in which (A) will directly result in (B). This is called a 'resultative' example.",N3
～た所だ,たところだ,,"Just finished doing, Was just doing","In a similar way to how ところ (sometimes shortened to とこ) means 'about to (A)', or 'on the verge of (A)', when following the non-past form of a verb, when following the auxiliary verb た, ところ will mean 'just did (A)'. To use this structure, make the past tense of any verb, and then add ところ . While this expresses 'just did (A)', ていた may be used when you would like to express that you were 'just doing (A)'. Caution When the kanji form of 所 is used, it is often referring to an actual physical location, rather than a situation/standpoint. However, this is something that native speakers will sometimes mistake. Therefore, seeing the kanji form and the hiragana form are both relatively common.",N4
～たところで,たところで,,"Even if ~ cannot or will not, Even though ~ not","～たところで is a grammar construction that combines the simple-past form of a verb, the noun ところ 'place', and the case-marking particle で. As with most other grammar patterns that ところ is seen with, the focus is on the situation of the verb occurring. ～たところで is often translated as 'even if (A), not (B)', or 'even if (A), it won't be (B)'. This 'even if' nuance is created by the fact that ～たところで sentences will never have something in the past tense in the second half of the sentence, despite using the past tense before ところ. This is similar to the English 'even if (A) were to happen, (B) would still not occur'. As can be seen by the examples above, ～たところで will convey things that are counter to what the speaker either wants to, or wishes would happen. Due to this, the (B) half of the sentence will almost always be something unfavorable. Fun Fact Due to ～たところで always marking some kind of negative result in (B), (A) will often be preceded by words such as 今 さら, いくら, or どんなに. These usually just emphasize the frustration that the speaker feels about the inevitable result.",N1
た途端に,たとたんに,,"The instant or moment, As soon as, Just as","たとたんに , frequently seen using its kanji form た 途端 に is a structure used to convey that something happens 'the instant', or 'the moment' that something else occurs. It is a combination of the auxiliary verb た (indicating the completion of a verb), and the noun 途端 'on the tip of' used adverbially (with に ). (A) た 途端 に (B) is used to express (B) things that are beyond the control of the speaker, and may be considered strange, or unexpected. As 途端 literally means 'on the tip of', any (B) action is considered to happen either directly upon (A), or even simultaneously with (A).",N3
～たなり...,たなり・なり,,"While... ~ing, Remaining, Not or ever since, Keep or leave","When following the た, past-tense form of a verb, the conjunction particle なり 'shape' indicates something existing in an ongoing state, similar to まま. This may be translated as 'while (A)', or 'remaining (A)'. Due to ～たなり sentences usually describing something happening while in the state of (A), it will often be followed directly by a comma, or by the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb だ, で. After this, the (B) phrase will then describe what is happening during (A). ～たなり will primarily be used to express an undesirable state continuing despite (A) having happened, although this is not a strict rule. As ～たなり indicates that (A) is something that is continuing to stay in the same state, it will often have the nuance of 'ever since (A)' in situations where a significant amount of time has passed. Caution This なり derives from the noun 形 'shape' in its hiragana form, and is different to the なり that is used as the classic copula.",N1
～たばかり,たばかり,,"Just did, Something just happened","As an adverbial particle , ばかり usually has one of three basic meanings. Degree: 程度 - Highlights the 'rough' amount/degree of something (similar to くらい). Limit: 限定 - Highlights the 'limit' of something (similar to だけ ). Completion: 完了 - Highlights the 'end', or 'completion' of something. In this lesson, we will focus primarily on the completion meaning. When connecting ばかり to the past form of a verb (using た), it will imply that a specific action has 'just finished', 'just stopped', or 'just been completed'. Fun Fact Despite having three different meanings, ばかり can be thought of as always highlighting how close one thing is to another. Degree: 程度 - Highlights (A)'s degree of closeness (to a stated amount). Limit: 限定 - Highlights (A)'s degree of closeness (to a description). Completion: 完了 - Highlights (A)'s degree of closeness (to a point in time).",N4
度に,たびに,,"Each time, Every time, Whenever","度 に is the adverbial form of the noun 度 , meaning 'time' (as in 'at the time of'). たびに is frequently paired with either verbs, or nouns, in order to show that something happens 'whenever (A)', or 'each time (A)'. After nouns, the case marking particle の will be required before たびに . Fun Fact Like ごとに , たびに means 'every'. However, たびに is most often used to convey the nuance of する ごとに 'every time doing'. Due to this, たびに will almost always be used to highlight some kind of action or event, rather than random amounts of time.",N3
～た方がいい,たほうがいい,exp,"It'd be better to, Should do","In Japanese, there are several ways to express that something 'should' be done. たほうがいい is one of the most common, especially when giving advice. This expression uses the past tense of a verb grouped with 方 , the particle が , and the い-Adjective , いい . As 方 can be translated closely to 'way', or 'direction', this expression is suggesting that one specific choice is simply the better 'way'. This expression is quite direct, and can imply that there may be some sort of negative consequence if (A) is not done. In that respect, this phrase could also be translated as 'It would be better if you did (A)'. たほうがいい may also be used with the base (dictionary) form of a verb, but will sound more like a general opinion in those cases, rather than giving advice. Caution Because this phrase is quite direct, it would be better to use a more polite expression like ばいい , if giving general advice.",N5
給え(),たまえ,,"(Please) do!, Ask to, Beg to, (Order somebody to do something)","Originally coming from the う-Verb 給 う 'to give', or 'to bestow', the imperative form たまえ may be seen attached to the ます-stem of verbs, in order to create a light order. It is often translated simply as 'please do (A)'. Despite this, たまえ is a structure that is only used to someone of lower status than the speaker, and primarily only by men. This 'lower status relationship' is usually one that is obvious between both the speaker and the listener, such as a boss and subordinate. Fun-fact In the past, たまえ was sometimes used to ask for favors or for wishes to be granted in prayers. However, this use will primarily only be seen in books in the modern era.",N2
～たまで,～たまでだ,,"Just, Merely, Simply, Only","In comparison to ～るまでだ, the grammar pattern expressing that 'one can only but (A)', ～たまでだ works in a similar way, with the past tense of the verb indicating that 'doing (A) was all it was'. This emphasis is usually translated as 'I simply (A)', or 'I only (A)', with nuance on the action not being something especially big. Like ～るまでだ, ～たまでだ may be replaced with ～たまでのことだ, depending on what the speaker is trying to emphasize. As this structure emphasizes that (A) is not a big deal, it will often be used in order to modestly highlight that one only did the bare minimum, and therefore praising them is unnecessary. Caution Both ～るまでだ and ～たまでだ are only used in reference to one's own personal actions, or the actions of a group they are affiliated with.",N1
為に,ために,,"Due to, Because of, As a result of","ため (or 為 in its kanji form) is a noun in Japanese that can be translated quite closely to 'sake' in English. However, it is classified as a non-independent word in Japanese, and must always be connected to another word which illustrates the 'sake' that ため is highlighting. The case marking particle に will often be added after ため, to show that (A) is a goal that something will done to reach. However, when used with verbs in the past tense, ために more frequently highlights that something happened 'due to (A)', rather than 'for the sake of (A)'. Because of this, a more accurate description of ため in all situations is 'in light of (A)'. This expresses that (A) is the primary or major event/thing that resulted in (B). To use ために as 'in light of', 'as a result of', or 'because of', attach it to the end of verb in its past form, or a noun follow by の. It may also be used after い-Adjectives or な-Adjectives in their attributive form . This 'in light of (A)' nuance can be used in reference to things that have already happened (as above), or in reference to something that is considered as the purpose of an action (as in our other ために grammar point).",N3
為に,ため(に),,"For, For the sake of, In order to","ため (or 為 in its kanji form) is a noun in Japanese that can be translated quite closely to 'sake' in English. However, it is classified as a non-independent word in Japanese, and must always be connected to another word which illustrates the 'sake' that ため is highlighting. The case marking particle に will often be added after ため , to show that (A) is a goal that something will be done to reach. Due to this, ために can be translated as 'for the sake of (A)', or 'in order to (A)'. To use ために , attach it to the end of verb in its non-past form, or a noun follow by の. Fun Fact Despite mainly being used to highlight goals, or things dictating an action, ため is also sometimes used to highlight events that have already taken place, and their results. Due to this, a more accurate translation of ため (in all of its uses) is 'in light of (A)'. This simply highlights that (A) is the primary or major event/thing that resulted in (B), or will result in (B). When ため highlights past events, it is often translated simply as 'due to', or 'because of'.",N3
～たものだ,たものだ,,Used to,"As mentioned the ものだ lesson, the combination of the noun 物 'thing', with the auxiliary verb だ forms a strong determination about whatever comes before it as being 'the way it is'. As an extension of this nuance, ものだ can be paired with verbs in the past tense, creating a phrase similar to 'I used to (A) in the past'. However, the literal meaning is closer to '(A) was the way it used to be'. Due to ものだ being a strong determination of something's existence/truth, this expression quite often carries the nuance that the speaker is nostalgic about (A), reminiscing about (A), or being introspective about (A). This means that it will not sound natural when describing things that are seemingly inconsequential, or have no meaningful significance. When highlighting things in the past that are not particularly important, たことがある will be used instead.",N3
といい,たらいい・といい,,"It would be nice if, It would be good if, Should, I hope","When any of the conjunction particles that carry the meaning of 'if' ( たら , ば , or と ) are paired with the い-Adjective , いい , they will express the desired result of the speaker. These all translate to 'it would be nice if (A)'. However, the speaker's level of certainty about the result being 'good' will change slightly, depending on the particle. ばいい - Hypothetically, (A) happening would be good. (Lowest strength/certainty) たらいい - When (A) happens, it will be good. (Medium strength/certainty) といい - The result of (A) is good. (Strongest/most certain) To use ば , たら , or といい , first add the conjunction particle to the end of any verb, and then attach the い-Adjective , いい .",N3
たらどう,たらどう,,"Why don't you...?, What if you did...?","When the conjunction particle たら is used before the adverb どう, it primarily presents a situation, then asks a question about it potentially happening. This construction can be translated as 'why don't you (A)?', or 'what if you did (A)?'. Realistically, it just means 'when (A), how about that?'. It is often used for giving advice. To use this expression, convert the verb that you want to use into its たら form, and then add どう. Sometimes たら is used by itself, with a tone that implies that it is a question (or simply by adding a question mark in written language). This is an abbreviation of たらどう , and carries the same nuance. だ or か may be added to the end of たらどう , to emphasize the 'question' even further. However, they are not required. Caution Despite being used for giving advice, たらどう may be interpreted as criticism. Due to this, care will need to be taken with your tone of voice.",N4
たら最後,たら最後,,"Once, Now that, As soon as","たら 最後 and たが 最後 are grammar structures that both share the meaning of 'once (A), definitely (B)'. (B) will always be something negative that is thought to inevitably occur once the action of (A) happens. These expressions may be translated as 'once (A), (B)', 'now that (A), (B)', or 'as soon as (A), (B)'. Both たら and が are being used as conjunction particles . たら carries its usual meaning of 'if' or 'when', while が has the meaning of 'however', or 'but'. This means that たが 最後 means '(A), but it will end up as (B)', while たら 最後 means 'when (A), in will end up as (B)'. Although this nuance is slightly different, they are used completely interchangeably. Because 最後 is primarily seen before the comma in these types of sentences, it can be easy to think that it is connected to the が or たら. However, it is actually more correctly connected logically to the (B) half of the sentence, and states that the 'final state' will end up being that way. Caution Occasionally, the (B) phrase will be omitted from these sentences when the negative result is obvious.",N1
たら〜で,たら〜で,,"Even if, If","たら〜で is an expression that appears with repeating words, and may be used either positively or negatively in order to show that 'if (A), then with (A), (B)'. It is often simply translated as 'even if (A), (B)'. たら〜で may use either the conjunction particle たら or ば when paired with verbs or い-Adjectives, but will use なら when paired with な-Adjectives. In たら〜で constructions, it is important to remember that the nuance will change depending on the first half of the sentence. Basically, the most common interpretations are as follows. In the good situation of (A), the problem of (B) will arise. In the problematic situation of (A), (B) can still be done. So in either case, it can be seen that (B) will be something that is contradictory to (A). Caution In this meaning, なら～で will only ever follow な-Adjectives. If you see なら〜で following another type of word, then it will be the meaning used for showing dissatisfaction, or telling people what to do.",N1
たら,たら,,"When, From when, Just when, If","The conjunction particle たら is used as a kind of 'halfway point' between 'if' and 'when' in Japanese. It expresses the completion of an (A) action, and then a (B) action that is considered to be the result of (A). It may be hypothetical, or it may be presenting a one-time result of something that happened in the past. To use たら , it will replace た in the simple past form of verbs, い-Adjectives , な-Adjectives , and nouns. Caution Despite appearing to be the past form of the word that it is attached to, たら itself does not actually carry the nuance of 'past'. Other words in the sentence will need to be examined to see whether たら is truly highlighting something from the past, or simply the completion of something (which may or may not happen in the future). Fun Fact Although たら is regularly used to mean 'if', it almost always has a nuance of 'when'. This is due to たら specifically highlighting the following situations: Completion: 完了 - Completion of (A). Materialization: 成立 - Coming to fruition of (A). These meanings are opposed to other 'if' structures like ば , and なら , which focus far more strongly on the hypothetical 'if' meaning.",N4
たり～たりする,たり～たりする,prt,Things like ~ and ~,"In Japanese, たり is a 'conjunction particle' that is used in exactly the same way as て . However, instead of having the nuance of 'then', or 'and', it has the nuance of 'and things like'. Basically, it is used for listing sequences of events that do not happen in a specific order. The last たり in any sequence will almost always be followed by する (or した for past tense). From these examples we can see that たり will sometimes be said as だり . This happens with the same verbs that usually use だ for past tense (like 読 んだ), or で for the て form ( like 泳 いで). This will not change the meaning at all, and is only to help make the words easier to say. To summarize, the difference between て form, and たり is as follows. Events in order - I did (A) て , (B) て , (C) て , (D) た. Events in no specific order - I did (D) たり , (B) たり , (A) たり , (C) たり した . たり is frequently used when there is only one verb in the sentence. This just means that the speaker did 'things like (A)', without specifically listing anything else. Caution In cases where a する verb is the last verb in a particular sequence, たり will often be omitted.",N5
たるに,たる,,"To be (in a position of), As a, For","たるに is a structure that indicates something that 'is (A)' in the same way as である, and will often be translated as '(B) in the position of (A)', or '(B) as an (A)'. たるに itself as a combination of たる, which is the attributive form of classical auxiliary verb たり, and the case marking particle に. たるに will appear after a noun marking some sort of position, with a statement about that position following after. It may be used either positively or negatively. たるに is not as common as たるもの , which is a combination of たる and the noun 者 , used to identify people. In these cases, (A) たる 者 will specifically mean 'a person in the position of (A)', and generally describes what is appropriate of that position. This use may be translated as 'for' or 'as'. Although this structure means 'to be' in the same way as である, the emphasis is far more on qualifications or expectations related to that position. Due to this, たる will not be used when simply stating that '(B) is (A)'. Caution Although たる does relate to the suitability of something being in a specific position, be careful not to confuse it with the う-Verb 足 る 'to be sufficient', or 'to be worthy'. Fun Fact たり itself is a contraction of the case marking particle と and あり 'to be'. This can be compared to なり, which is a contraction of に and あり.",N1
～た末,た末・の末,,"After, As a conclusion of","Appearing with verbs in their past form, or grouped with nouns after の is 末 , a word meaning 'end tip'. に will follow 末 , marking the 'tip' as the point from which something will result. While this grammar pattern is usually translated as 'after (A), (B)', or 'as a result of (A), (B)', the nuance is on various things having happened along the way, and then finally reaching the 'point' or 'conclusion' of (A). 末 に may highlight either positive or negative results, but will suggest that some long-lasting effort or struggle eventually resulted in (B).",N2
大体,だいたい,,"Most・mostly, Adequately・generally, For the most part, Roughly・approximately, In the first place","大体 is an adverb that is used to highlight the 'main point' of something in Japanese, and therefore has several different nuances. 大体 will regularly be translated as 'mostly', 'generally', or 'for the most part'. As with other adverbs that highlight amounts, 大体 can be used to modify entire phrases, or can be used directly before a noun as 大体 の + noun. In a similar way to そもそも, a noun/adverb which means 'in the first place', 大体 can also have this meaning. This nuance is frequently quite obvious, as the rest of the sentence will highlight a desired outcome that unfortunately did not happen. Although these 2 primary uses of 大体 may seem quite different, they are both just expressing what is 'essentially' correct, most common, the original, etc. Fun Fact A common synonym for 大体 is 根本 , a noun which means 'the source', or 'the origin' or something. In this way, 大体 just expresses the way something is, without receiving any alterations (regardless of whether any subsequent alterations are positive or negative). This is where the 'in essence' meaning comes from.",N4
だが,だが・ですが,,"But, Still, However, Nevertheless","While だが (or ですが as a polite equivalent) are classified as their own words, they are actually just combinations of だ , or です , and が . だが is usually used as a formal way of saying 'but', or 'nevertheless'. Due to this, we can see that だ is being used to 'determine' that a statement is true, while が simply shows that there is other important information to follow. In this way, だが is very similar to the expression 'that may be, but…' in English. だが may be used at the beginning of any phrase, or between sentences. Caution When using ですが , it will automatically mean that the rest of the sentence should also use polite speech . To make だが sound a little bit softer, sometimes ね is added. However, this is not so common in modern-day Japanese, and is more limited to the older generation. Fun Fact Due to だが and ですが using が (the formal equivalent of けど ), this phrase can sound quite stiff. Therefore, it is far more common to hear でも at the beginning of a sentence in casual speech.",N4
だけあって,だけあって,,"Is only natural, …Being the case, Because, As might be expected","Like だけに, だけあって is a phrase that is used to show that something is 'only natural for (A)', or 'as might be expected of (A)'. This structure includes the particle だけ 'just', or 'only', and the て-form of the う-Verb ある 'to be'. In this way, the more literal meaning may be interpreted as 'just being (A), (B)', and implies that the innate trait or traits of (A) led to the expected result of (B). だけあって will only be used when the expected result is something that is positive in relation to (A). Like most other grammar patterns that begin with だけ, this structure may be used with verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives followed by な, or nouns. Caution As だけあって emphasizes an innate or constant quality of (A), it will not be used for things that are not obvious, or have not yet happened. This means that だけあって will not appear in sentences discussing things that may happen in the future, and will also not often be utilized with phrases such as だろう, でしょう, かもしれない, or similar structures that express uncertainty.",N2
だけしか～ない,だけしか,,"To emphasize '~only', Nothing but","だけしか is a combination of two adverbial particles , だけ 'only', and しか 'nothing but'. This structure primarily follows nouns, before part (B) of the sentence will have a corresponding ない based word. Despite all of these possibilities, it should be noted that だけしか～ない is an expression that appears with negative verbs, far more than any of the other combinations. Fun Fact だけしか may appear as though it is saying 'only' twice, but each particle has its own specific nuance. These nuances are as follows: だけ - Removes one thing (from within a group), and presents it as the 'only' thing that fits a certain criteria. しか - Highlights something that exists by itself as not having any alternatives. Due to this, each meaning compounds together, with だけ saying 'just this', while しか adds 'and only this!'. Reversing the order and putting しか before だけ would not work, as the sequence of selection needs to be logical.",N3
だけでなくて～も,だけでなく(て)～も,,"Not only ~ but ~ also, Not just ~ but ~ also","As an extension of the standard だけでなく , meaning 'not only, but also', adding the adverbial particle も to the (B) part of a sentence will place extra emphasis on the thing that is being included in the same category as (A). だけ itself is an adverbial particle , so will primarily follow nouns. After this, the negative conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb だ (でなく) will create the 'not only' meaning. て is not strictly required as part of this structure, but will help to create a far more natural 'separation' between (A) and (B) when it is used. Either じゃなく or じゃなくて may also be used, as is the case with all でなく and ではなく based grammar structures.",N3
だけでなく,だけでなく,,Not only… but also,"だけでなく (an abbreviation of だけではなく ) is a common construction in Japanese which translates to 'not only (A), but also (B)'. Sometimes the (B) statement may be left unsaid. This expression may connect to any (A) phrase that だけ would usually be able to connect to. Caution The で in では is not the particle で , but the auxiliary verb だ in its conjunctive form . は is regularly dropped from では expressions, or it may also be changed to じゃ , for ease of pronunciation. The conjunction particle て should follow なく, as it is the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective ない. However, the て in this particular construction is very often omitted. Caution In writing, if there is no comma (known as a 読点 in Japanese) after なく, the full なくて construction will be required. When a comma is present, both forms are grammatically correct.",N4
だけで,だけで,,"Just by, Just with","だけで is a combination of the adverbial particle だけ , and the case marking particle で . This expression is regularly thought of as meaning 'just by (A), (B)'. However, the literal translation is a bit closer to 'with only (A), (B)'. This reflects the で particle's standard usage of showing a 'tool' that is being used to achieve a certain result. To use だけで , simply attach it to the end of any (non ます) form of verb, or noun. Fun Fact だけ differs from しか in one very important way. だけ highlights that there is/was more than one option, but that only one thing was chosen/used. However, しか implies that there is only one possible option to begin with.",N4
だけに,だけに,,"As might be expected, Because, All the more because, It's only natural","だけに is a grammar pattern that is often translated as 'as might be expected of (A)', 'it's only natural due to (A)', or simply 'because of (A)'. Being a combination of だけ 'just', and に 'to', the literal meaning is 'just in that it's (A)', and is similar to the counterpart phrase in English. だけに may be used when highlighting either positive or negative results that came about due to (A), and will appear after verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives that have been followed by な, or nouns. Also, だけに may be used when highlighting that specifically because of (A), (B) is considered a level above what would usually be expected. This can be in terms of difficulty, emotional reaction, volume, or anything else that is quantifiable. Fun-fact With any of these meanings, the equivalent 'just in that it's (A)' English expression can be utilized as an accurate interpretation, as both it and だけに often just draw the listener's attention to (A), in order to show that (B) is noteworthy because of it.",N2
だけのことはある,だけのことはある,,"No wonder, Not surprising that, As expected","だけのことはある is a grammar structure consisting of the particle だけ, の, こと, は, and the う-Verb ある. It is used when indicating that something about (A) is 'as expected', or 'not surprising'. As a literal translation, it can be thought that the meaning is close to 'just in that it is (A), (B)', and expresses that simply because (A) is (A), (B) is to be expected. だけのことはある will often appear with other words that add emphasis to the expectation of (A), such as さすが, やはり, or やっぱり. This grammar pattern may be seen following verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns. な will be required after な-Adjectives. In the case of nouns and な-Adjectives, it is also possible to see だっただけのことはある when highlighting that some particular result is not surprising. Caution だけのことはある is not used to indicate negative expectations, so will only appear when the overall sentence is a positive evaluation of what was expected of (A).",N2
だけは,だけは,,"To do all that one can, As much or many ~ as one could","だけは is another one of the many grammar patterns in Japanese that includes the particle だけ, meaning 'just' or 'only'. In this particular structure, だけ pairs with は, and presents a specific verb as the topic to indicate that it is being done 'as much as one can'. The same verb will be repeated both before and after だけは , with the one coming second usually appearing in its past-tense or ている form. Imagining that the target verb was 食 べる 'to eat', the literal translation of something like 食 べる だけは 食 べた would be 'I ate just what I could eat'. Because this pattern frequently discusses possibilities, it is also very common for the first verb to be in the potential れる or られる form. Caution It is also relatively common to see する omitted following the first verb, and only being used after だけは . In this kind of pattern, the target verb itself will not usually be repeated after だけは .",N2
だけましだ,だけましだ,,"At least, It's better than..., One should feel grateful for","だけましだ is a set phrase indicating that 'at least (A)', or that 'one should feel grateful for (A)'. This expression is often used in cases where the overall situation is negative, but it is still better than the alternative. This structure is a combination of the particle だけ 'only', and the な-Adjective 増 し, meaning 'better', or 'preferable'. Originally, まし is just the conjunctive form of 増 す, an う-Verb meaning to grow or increase (like 増 える). Due to this, the literal meaning is 'even just (A) is a plus, compared to what could have occured'. だけましだ will be used primarily after verbs, い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives followed by な. In the vast majority of cases, まし will simply be written in hiragana, or even katakana as マシ. The katakana version often further emphasizes that one should be grateful for (A). Caution - Although not as common, だけまだましだ may also be seen. As can be seen by the addition of まだ 'still', this form merely emphasized the point even further.",N2
だけ,だけ,prt,"Only, Just","だけ is used in Japanese in a similar way to 'only' or 'just' in English. The basic meaning of this word is that 'while there are/were several possibilities, only (A) is true/was chosen'. だけ is used by attaching it to the base (dictionary) form of any word, except for な-Adjectives , which require な when being used adjectivally. Due to な-Adjectives being able to be used as either a noun or an adjective, the meaning of a sentence will be different depending on whether だけ is used with the noun form, or the adjective form. Basically this difference just highlights whether something is being discussed in a measurable way (an adjective), or an immeasurable way (a noun).",N5
出す,だす,,"To suddenly begin, To start doing","だす , or 出 す in its kanji form is a verb that is regularly attached to the conjunctive form of other verbs. When it is connected in this way, it has the meaning of 'to suddenly do (A)', or 'to burst into (A)'. To use this construction, simply add だす to the ます stem (conjunctive form) of the verb that you want to highlight as happening 'suddenly'. Caution Unlike はじめる , another common structure which means 'to begin', だす quite often has the nuance of being unintentional, or something that the subject cannot avoid doing (or cannot be controlled). On the other hand, はじめる expresses the direct intention of the subject to do (A).",N4
だった,だった・でした,aux-v,"Was, Were (Past tense)","In order to say that something 'was' a certain way in Japanese, you will need to use だった (casual) or でした (polite) attached to the end of a noun or な-Adjective . This is simply a combination of two auxiliary verbs , だ (or です when polite) with た. For だった , we will need to add った to the base form of だ . For です , す will change to し before adding た. Caution The past form of い-Adjectives cannot be linked with だった or でした , as they have their own set of conjugation rules.",N5
でした,だった・でした,aux-v,"Was, Were (Past tense)","In order to say that something 'was' a certain way in Japanese, you will need to use だった (casual) or でした (polite) attached to the end of a noun or な-Adjective . This is simply a combination of two auxiliary verbs , だ (or です when polite) with た. For だった , we will need to add った to the base form of だ . For です , す will change to し before adding た. Caution The past form of い-Adjectives cannot be linked with だった or でした , as they have their own set of conjugation rules.",N5
だって,だって,,"I heard/was said, Because, But, Even or also, Even if or even though","だって is a colloquial combination of the auxiliary verb だ , and the adverbial particle とて in Japanese (a combination of the particles と, and て). It has a wide range of uses, but primarily exclaims that something is the 'premise' for whatever has been said, or will be said next. This 'exclamation' is usually translated as 'I heard', 'cause', 'but', or 'even if'. The meaning that will be conveyed is determined primarily by where だって appears in a sentence. When placed at the beginning of a sentence, だって highlights the speaker's (usually) displeasure about something that has just been said, before following it with an explanation or counterpoint. This だって is quite similar to でも . At the end of a sentence, だって is used to express hearsay, in a similar way to 'I heard that', or 'it was said that', in English. In these cases it will be preceded by なん. なんだって always appears after a noun, or a phrase that has been nominalized (with の or こと). Caution When used directly after a noun, だって has a similar nuance to the だって that appears at the beginning of sentences (emphasizing what has come before it, in order to explain further). This comes across as でも , and may not be used with なん. Fun Fact The adverbial particle とて itself is an abbreviation of expressions like と 言 って, and と 思 って. だとて (the full construction) may also be used, but is almost always replaced by だって, as it is far easier to say. Fun Fact When used at the beginning of a sentence, もん or もの will often come at the end of that sentence, in order to strengthen the opinion given by the speaker. This is more commonly used by women and children.",N3
だに,だに,,"Not even, Not at all, Never could have","だに is an adverbial particle that shares a similar meaning to さえ and すら 'even', but is more commonly found in classical literature. It will be paired with negative structures and presents 'minimum' or 'light' examples to which (A) does not apply, and therefore obviously also does not apply to anything greater than (A). It will be translated as 'not even (A), so not (B)', or 'not (B) at all'. だに will be seen following nouns or noun-phrases. Although だに often appears when the (B) part of a sentence is negative, だに itself is not limited to being used this way. When following verbs, and the (B) phrase is not negative, だに simply means 'just'. It is best to keep this in mind, as the core meaning of this adverbial particle will always be to mark the word or phrase before it as an extremely small amount or lower limit. Caution だに is only used in a very limited set of expressions in modern Japanese. Some example of these are 夢 にだに 'even in a dream', 想像 するだに 'even in my imagination', 考 えるだに 'even to consider', 聞 くだに 'even hearing', 微動 だに 'even a quiver'.",N1
だの,だの,,"Things like, And so on, Or something, And whatnot","Although originally a combination of the auxiliary verb だ, and the case-marking particle の, だの is considered to be a standalone adverbial particle in modern Japanese that is used in the same way as structures like など and とか in presenting examples. Due to this, it will often be translated as 'and things like (A)', or '(A) and whatnot'. だの will only be used when at least two examples are given, with each of those examples being followed by だの . Usually, these two things are either opposites of each other, or two things that share the same negative trait. だの may appear after verbs, い-Adjectives, nouns, or quotations. Caution In situations where the words that だの is attached to are opposites, it will be exhibiting a large range to which the same rule applies. However when the words are similar, it is usually expressing things within that specific category as being undesirable. Because of this, regardless of what the words are, the overall statement itself aims to emphasize the speaker's feelings of frustration or boredom in relation to things that fall under that category, or that scope.",N1
だらけ,だらけ,,"Completely covered in, Full of","だらけ is a suffix that is used in Japanese to express when one thing is 'covered in', or 'filled with' another thing. だらけ will be attached to the end of nouns, before (sometimes) being followed by the case marking particle の and a second noun. The second noun is frequently omitted if the place or thing that is 'covered in' something is obvious. Fun Fact だらけ is primarily used to express things that exist in a 'scattered' state (like stars in the sky). Due to this, it will not sound natural when used to describe a thing that is 'covered in' something that is not scattered in some way.",N3
誰,誰,n,Who,"誰 is a substitute noun that is used in Japanese to describe unknown people. Due to Japanese particles behaving in very specific ways, 誰 will be translated differently depending on the particle that follows it. 誰 が ・ 誰 で ・ 誰 に ・ 誰 を (who), 誰 の (whose), 誰 か (somebody), 誰 も (any/everybody). Caution Depending on the style of polite speech, there are several different words that will be used to indicate an unknown person. どなた is used in honorific language , while どちらさま is used in polite speech .",N5
だろう,だろう,aux-v,"Right?, Probably, Isn't it?","だろう is a conjugated form of だ , and can also be seen in the contracted form だろ (more casual). だろう expresses that the speaker thinks that something is true (assertion/expectation), and also that the listener would probably agree with them. This comes across like 'right?', or 'probably' in English. だろう carries exactly the same meaning as でしょう (the polite equivalent). However, due to だ being more casual than です , だろう is also considered to be more casual/masculine than でしょう . Caution While だろう is usually used when the speaker has some sort of information that would support their assertion, it can also be used simply when the speaker 'feels' that something is true. In this kind of sentence that expresses a 'feeling' or 'hunch', だろう comes across as quite low confidence. The speaker's tone of voice will often reveal how confident だろう is.",N5
段々,だんだん,,"Gradually, Little by little, Step by step","だんだん is an adverb that is used to express the slight, but constant, progression of something. Originally, it comes from the kanji construction 段々 , which can be thought of as meaning 'step by step', 'stepwise', or even 'steadily'. だんだん is similar to ほとんど , in that it can modify the meaning of entire phrases, rather than just single words. To use だんだん , simply put it before the phrase that you want to express as '(A) that is increasing steadily'. While だんだん can take the particle と , it is not required. In fact, と is very often omitted from adverbs/onomatopoeic words (words that represent a sound or motion) in Japanese. Caution Initially, it can be easy to mix-up だんだん , with どんどん . どんどん is an onomatopoeic word that represents loud banging (like on a drum), so is used to express fast changes/progression. This is unlike だんだん , which expresses slower changes/progression.",N4
だ,だ,aux-v,"To be, Is","For the most part, だ is the equivalent of 'is' in English. Its role is to strongly express determination or assertion. It is a casual grammar structure, which means that you won't see it in polite sentences. Technically, だ is an auxiliary verb , a group of words that attach themselves to other words to give them meaning. です has the same role as だ , but です is the one that will be used in polite sentences, and is also one of the first Japanese grammar patterns many people are exposed to. だ will always follow nouns, or words that behave like nouns, such as な-Adjectives . Caution だ should never be attached to the end of い-Adjectives . In these cases, it is considered more correct to attach a polite equivalent, like です . Caution While だ is often thought of as the 'casual form' of です , that is actually not entirely true. です is a polite speech word. The official 'formal version' of だ is である . We will learn this grammar point a bit later. である can often be seen in articles, and formal writing, while です is more common in polite speech .",N5
ちゃんと,ちゃんと・きちんと,,"Properly, Neatly, Orderly, Sufficiently, Decently","In Japanese, two 副詞 (adverbs) that are used to express very similar ideas are ちゃんと , and きちんと. These words may be used either at the beginning of a sentence (to modify the meaning of the whole sentence), or before verbs. ちゃんと and きちんと both translate quite closely to 'properly', or 'neatly'. Fun Fact Historically, ちゃんと was also used to convey 'quickly'. However, it is almost never used for this purpose in modern Japanese. Despite this, both ちゃんと and きちんと do have a slight nuance of doing something 'without dawdling'. This can mostly be attributed to the base meaning of 'properly' also implying that something is not done lazily.",N3
っけ,っけ,,"What is…again?, Was it... that... ?, Did you say...?","け is a sentence ending particle in Japanese that is used to convey when the speaker is trying to either remember, or confirm information that they have forgotten. In this way, it is very similar to the 'again' in 'what is (A) again?' け may only be used after the past form of the auxiliary verbs だ or た. This means that け (should) only be seen as だっけ or たっけ. It is also common to see のだ and んだ utilized to make verb tenses a possibility. Caution Despite the grammar rules related to っけ , the younger generation quite often uses it without the addition of んだ (especially with verbs). While it is important to understand that this is still っけ , it is not a grammatically correct form that may be used in writing (or formal speaking). Fun Fact け will sound equally natural when asking a rhetorical question to yourself, or when directly asking another person about something that you have forgotten.",N3
っこない,っこない,,"There is no chance of, There is no way of, Impossible","っこない is a combination of the suffix っこ, and the い-Adjective ない. When attached to the conjunctive form of verbs, it creates new い-Adjectives that express the impossibility of (A). (A) being whichever verb is used. Common translations of っこない include 'there is no chance of (A)', or 'doing (A) is impossible'. Caution Although extremely rare, as っこ stems from the kanji 子 , this grammar point may occasionally be seen in its kanji form.",N2
といっ,ったらない・といったらない,,"Cannot tell, describe, say or express how, Words cannot express, Too … for words, Extremely","といったらない is a casual expression used when something is at a level such that not even (A) is sufficient to describe it. It is usually translated as 'there are no words to express (A)', or 'too (A) for words'. This structure is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the conjunction particle たら 'when', or 'if', and the い-Adjective ない. It may be used in either positive or negative contexts. といったらない , or the shortened form ったらない may appear after adjectives or nouns in their standard form s. The ない in this grammar pattern is commonly thought to be an abbreviation of ありはしない, or ありゃしない, the conjunctive form of the う-Verb ある combined with the case marking particle は, and the negated form of する, しない. In this way, a more literal meaning can be thought of as 'if one were to say (A), it's not possible'. Caution As this expression highlights an extreme amount, い-Adjectives will often be used with the さ suffix added, specifically to indicate amount.",N1
ったら,ったら・といったら,,"Cannot tell, describe, say, express or find words for how, Words cannot express, Too … for words, Extremely",Error: Could not extract explanation,N1
ってば,ってば・ったら,exp,"I said...!, I told you...!, !","ってば and ったら are often used in casual Japanese to insist the speaker's own viewpoint or opinion about something. The structures are frequently translated as 'I said (A)!', or 'I told you (A)!'. ってば and ったら are contractions of といえば 'if it were said', and といったら 'if it were said' respectively. In these cases, the literal meaning is very similar to the English 'didn't I say (A)!?' when used sarcastically or aggressively. Either ってば or ったら may follow just about any word, but will require a だ to precede them when coming after nouns or な-Adjectives. Caution ってば and ったら may also directly follow nouns without だ. In these cases, the noun is generally a person (perhaps the speaker themselves), and the translation will be 'oh that (A)', 'that darn (A)'. (A) will primarily be people that the speaker is quite familiar with, and they are expressing some kind of real or playful frustration.",N1
って,って,,"As for, Speaking of, Casual は (Sentence topic marker)","Although って can be used as a casual quotation marker in Japanese (replacing と), it is also frequently used as a casual topic marker (replacing は). This is something that occurs primarily in spoken language, and will come directly after the sentence topic, in exactly the same way as the adverbial particle は usually would.",N3
って,って,prt,Casual quotation,"って is a casual variation of the と particle that is used for quoting something. This use is called 引用 in Japanese, which basically translates to 'reference', or 'citation'. って is almost exclusively used after direct quotations, and will be followed by a verb indicating what type of communication was used. 言 った, 思 った, 聞 いた, for example. Just like with と , the verb that comes after って is frequently omitted. This is even more true for って , as many things are omitted in casual language. Caution Although often heard, due to って being very casual, it can be considered unnatural to use in sentences that also use the です or ます polite structures. However, if the conversation is formal but friendly (like between a senpai and a kouhai), most people would consider it normal.",N5
っぱなし,っぱなし,,"Leaving something in a certain state, Left as is, Keep on -ing","っぱなし is a suffix that originally comes from the う - Verb 放 す 'to let loose'. When attached to the conjunctive form of verbs, it is used to indicate that something has been 'left' in a certain state. っぱなし is almost exclusively used negatively. Fun Fact Although 放 す means 'to let loose', っぱなし conveys a feeling that is closer to 'being unchecked'. This means っぱなし can be used to convey that 'the act of (A)' is continuing without anyone there to stop it, or that the 'state of (A)' is continuing without anyone there to stop it. Which meaning is conveyed will depend mostly on the (A) verb.",N3
っぽい-,っぽい,,"-ish, -like, Characteristic of, Typical of, Tendency to","っぽい (occasionally also seen as ぽい) is a suffix that may be attached to many different types of words, in order to create new い-Adjectives . In all cases, っぽい indicates something that is 'exhibiting characteristics of (A)'. This is most often in reference to the way (A) is acting, or the way (A) looks. In English, っぽい may be translated as '(A)ish', '(A)like', or 'tendency to (A)'. っぽい quite often carries a negative connotation. As っぽい creates い-Adjectives from other words, it may be used with the conjunctive form of verbs, or the 語幹 (stem form) of any other word. Caution As っぽい creates new い-Adjectives , っぽい itself may be conjugated in exactly the same way as regular い-Adjectives . Caution The fundamental meaning of っぽい will change depending on what type of word it is being used with. The general rules are as follows: Verb + っぽい - To have a tendency to do (A). Adjective + っぽい - To exhibit all the signs of being (A). Noun + っぽい - To obviously not be (A), although show signs of being (A). From this, we can see that っぽい is generally based on the opinion of the speaker, rather than the innate qualities of what is being observed. Thus, with verbs, adjectives, and nouns, the speaker feels like (A) is in excess, compared to what would be expected. This 'being in excess of what is normal' in the opinion of the speaker is what creates the negative connotation.",N3
序でに,ついでに,,"While you are at it, On the occasion","序 に is an adverb in Japanese that is used in a similar way to 'while you're at it', or 'on the occasion of (A)' in English. 序 itself is a noun that means 'precedence' (in terms of being the first thing to happen). Due to this, the literal meaning of 序 に may be thought of as 'with (A) as the precedence, (B)'. 序 に is commonly used with verbs, or nouns. In the case of nouns, it will need to be preceded by the case marking particle の. Fun Fact Just like 'precedence' in English, 序 に implies that (A) is the instigator for (B). Because of this, 序 に is a good way to convey that something is not urgent, but, if (A) is happening, it is the perfect chance to do (B) as well. Caution 序 に is more formal than 間 に or 時 に, so has more of a tendency to be used for 'one-off' things, rather than regular occurrences. Despite this, it still may be used to describe regular occurrences at times, especially when speaking formally or politely, such as to a senpai.",N3
つい,つい,,"Accidentally, Unconsciously, Against one's better judgement","Appearing most frequently at the beginning of sentences, つい is an adverb that may be translated as 'accidentally', 'unconsciously', 'absentmindedly', or 'against one's better judgment'. つい will often be paired with statements that use てしまう , to emphasize that something was unintentional. Fun Fact Although 'accidentally' is the most common meaning of つい , it actually may be used to convey three different nuances. These are as follows: はからず - Something that is uncalculated. 思 わず - Something that is not thought about. 距離 が わずかなさま - A small gap/interval. In each of these meanings, つい keeps a sense of time being the most important factor. Due to this, つい will give the impression that whatever resulted in the 'accidental' action, will be something that happened momentarily. This is very close to the meaning of 'lapse' in English. 'a lapse in time', 'a lapse in judgment', 'a lapse in forethought'.",N3
つつある-,つつある,,"-ing, Be -ing","When the particle つつ 'while doing' is combined with ある 'to be', it indicates that someone or something is in the ongoing process of (A). (A) will be a verb in its ます-stem form. This formal grammar structure primarily highlights that (A) is slowly but surely continuing or changing. This 'change' is often in regard to an increase, decrease, expansion, contraction, or something similar. This pattern can be translated simply as 'to be (A)ing'. Caution Compared to ている, つつある tends not to be used in relation to noticably physical motions, but rather highlights actions that indicate an ongoing state of change (such as the blooming of a flower), rather than simply 'continuing'. This is especially true for verbs that have an obvious end or completion point.",N2
つつも,つつ(も),,"Even while ~ing, Even though ~ing, Despite ~ing, Although ~ing","In addition to the base meaning of つつ 'while doing (A)' when used by itself, the addition of も simply adds the nuance of 'even'. This is often translated as 'even while doing (A), (B)', or 'although doing (A), (B)'. (B) will almost always be something that is somehow contradictory to (A). Like つつ , つつも will appear after the ます-stem of a verb that is the original ongoing action. Caution Like つつ , つつも will usually include a non-physical action in (A), such as reading, listening, looking, thinking, etc. (B) may be either physical or non-physical. Also, in the same way as つつ is similar to ながら , つつも is similar to ながらも . Despite the similarities, it will be important to remember that つつ only appears with verbs, while ながら can be used after almost any type of word.",N2
つつ,つつ,,"While, And","つつ is a particle in Japanese that appears after the ます-stem form of verbs. When used, it indicates that (B) is an action that is happening at the same time as (A). This usually translates simply as 'while (A), (B)'. つつ is a formal grammar structure and will appear in writing more than in speech. Caution Unlike ながら , つつ is used more often when the (A) action is an ongoing state, rather than an actual physical action that involves movement. ながら may be used for both physical motions and states. Despite this, the (B) action in つつ sentences may either be physical movements or ongoing states.",N2
続ける,つづける,,To continue,"By attaching the verb 続 ける 'to continue' to the conjunctive form of another verb, we will be able to express that '(A) is continuing'. Let's have a look at a few examples of this structure. Caution There is a difference in nuance between connecting one verb to another verb through the conjunctive form , or through the use of the conjunction particle て . The former implies that '(A) is being done in the way of (B)', while the latter implies that '(A) is being done, and then (B)'.",N4
つまり,つまり,,"In short, To sum up, In other words","つまり (or 詰 まり) is a word in Japanese that is often used as an adverb . It takes a previous statement (said either by the speaker or by someone else) and summarizes it. This translates as 'in short', 'in other words', and similar expressions in English. Fun Fact つまり comes from verb 詰 まる meaning to become 'packed', or 'condensed'. This means that the literal translation is of つまり is quite similar to its English interpretation.",N3
つもりだ,つもりだ,n,"To plan to, To intend to","つもり だ (or です ) is a grammar point that can have several meanings in Japanese, but is often translated simply as 'intend to (A)', or 'plan to (A)'. It can be used after the plain (dictionary) form of verbs, or after the ない form. In the last two sentences, there is quite a large difference in nuance, and can be thought of as similar to the difference between 'to intend not to' ない つもり , and 'to have no intention of' つもり は ない in English. The former will mean that (A) is being actively avoided, while the latter will indicate that one simply has no plans to (A). Fun Fact The literal meaning of つもり comes from the verb 積 もる, which means 'to pile up', or 'to load'. Due to this, つもり is regularly used to describe people that are doing something that is out of character for them, meaning that they have 'piled up' whatever feeling was required to act that way. In this example, the nuance of つもり is 'so you're really going to act like you're apologizing?!' However, the literal meaning is closer to 'so you've really piled up enough (nerve) in order to act like that's an apology?!' Caution The は in つもり は ない is interchangeable with が or じゃ (usually では is not used). The difference in nuance is that が gives the impression of being 'uninterested' in (A), while じゃ simply expresses that (A) is not the intended result.",N5
つもりで,つもりで,,"With the intention of doing, Instead of..., Act as if or pretend, Believing that..., Thinking that...","つもりで , being a combination of the noun つもり 'intention', and the case marking particle で 'with', this structure is used in several different ways, depending on what comes before it. When combined with verbs, な-Adjectives or nouns in their plain forms, it implies that (B) is being done with the intention of (A). As つもり is a noun, の will be required before it when grouped with other nouns, while な will be required when linked to な-Adjectives. However, when paired with verbs in the past form, つもりで implies that the speaker is 'acting as though (A)', 'pretending that (A)', or 'is convinced that (A)'. This meaning simply comes from the intention of something being contrary to what is actually true.",N2
つ,つ〜つ,,two contrasting actions,"つ is a conjunction particle in Japanese that is used in constructions where it will appear twice, highlighting contrasting verbs. This つ～つ structure is often translated as 'to be doing (A) and (B) over and over', where the actions are happening repeatedly one after the other. つ will connect to the conjunctive form of verbs, with (A) and (B) generally appearing in direct sequence. Additionally, it is also quite common to see the same verb being repeated in both places. When this happens, the (A) verb will be in the standard form , while the (B) verb will be in the passive form. This just translates as 'to do (A) and to have (A) done to oneself'. Caution This grammar pattern is only used with a limited set of words in modern Japanese. Here is a list of some standard combinations. 行 きつ 戻 りつ - To go back and forth. 浮 きつ 沈 みつ - To surface and submerge (to bob). 見 えつ 隠 れつ - To go in and our of sight. とつおいつ (from 取 りつ 置 きつ) - To waver between. 矯 めつ 眇 めつ - To take a good look. 組 んず 解 れつ - To intertwine and release (to grapple). 抜 きつ 抜 かれつ - To pull away and be pulled away from (to be neck and neck). 持 ちつ 持 たれつ - To have and to be held (to give and take). 押 しつ 押 されつ - To press and be pressed. 追 いつ 追 われつ - To overtake and be overtaken. 差 しつ 差 されつ - To pour and be poured (to take turns exchanging drinks).",N1
～てあげる,てあげる,,"To do something for someone, As a favor for","When joining the conjunction particle て , with the る-Verb あげる (to give), it implies that someone is doing something for the benefit of someone else. Literally, this expression means 'to give/bestow the action of (A) upon (B)', but translates more naturally as 'to do (A) for (B)', or 'to do (A) as a favor for (B)'. The receiver of the てあげる action will be marked with に , while the doer will be marked with が (if mentioned). Caution Unfortunately, てあげる can sound quite patronizing in modern Japanese, and should be avoided in situations where someone may take offence to having something done for them (for example, doing something for someone of higher status). This is primarily due to やる (a casual variation of 'to give') being phased out. Fun Fact Originally, やる was used when referring to giving water to plants, or feeding animals. However, some people started using あげる for these purposes as well, believing that it sounded 'nicer'. Historically, this actually achieved the opposite result, and some people began to think that あげる was insulting, as it was being used for plants/animals. These days, てやる is almost never used, unless you have a very close relationship with someone and are using it jokingly.",N4
～てある,てある,,"Something is done, Has been done, Remaining state","Like 'verb + ている ', 'verb + てある ' is a structure that will convey an ongoing state. However, that is where the similarities stop. てある may only be used with transitive verbs, and highlights the object itself as being the subject of the sentence (rather than the initial person/thing that performed the action). Because ある is being used, it highlights the object as being inanimate (or unable to undo the action that was performed on it). Due to this, てある is regularly translated as 'to be left (A)', or 'to remain (A)', where (A) is the original verb that somebody performed on the object. が may mark the object in these sentences when the action itself involves some kind of preparation. Examples are as follows: 予約 - Reservation (requires time investment to reserve). 準備 - Preparation (requires time investment to prepare). 録音 - Recording (requires time investment to make the recording). In situations that involve no real preparation (opening a door, for example), を will be preferred when marking the object.",N4
～ていく,ていく,,"To ~ and go, To go on, To start","This grammar construction is a mix of the conjunction particle て , and the verb 行 く 'to go'. To use this grammar point, you will need to attach て to any verb, and then follow it with いく. This nuance is usually that '(A) happened and then went', or 'will happen, and then go'. In other words, it will depend on whether いく is in present, or past tense. ていく can be used when representing time, or when representing a physical place. When representing a physical place, it is more likely that the kanji structure, 行 く will be used. However, this is not a set rule, and depends on the writer. When used in relation to time, the nuance is usually that something has already started/is about to start, and then will continue to progress in the same way. This is the opposite of てくる , which indicates that something has finally reached a certain state, after progressing in that way for some time. Fun Fact When compared to English, ていく is very similar to the phrase 'to go on to (A)', in relation to time. It focuses on the fact that the speaker is required to make some type of journey to arrive at a specific point. For example, 'She went on to become a doctor after university'.",N4
～ていただけませんか,ていただけませんか,,"Won't you, Could you please (Humble request)","ていただけませんか is the humble speech form of てもらえませんか, which itself is the negative potential form of てもらう 'to have (A) done by someone else'. This structure is a combination of て (the conjunction particle), the う-Verb いただく 'to be topped with', the polite-negative auxiliary verb ません, and the question particle, か . Generally, it is translated in a similar way as てもらえませんか 'won't you (A)', or 'could you please (A)'. This construction and いただく itself can regularly be seen as 頂 く, its kanji form. Due to this kanji literally meaning 'to be topped with', it is just acknowledging that the person that is doing the action for you (or someone in your group), is doing so from 'above' (sounds more respectful). Here we can see how the 'to be topped/capped with' meaning is used in a standard sentence.",N4
～ていた,ていた,,Was doing ~,"To convey that '(A) was happening', or that somebody 'was doing (A)' in Japanese, ていた (or ていました) will be used. ていた is a construction which uses the conjunction particle て , and the ichidan verb いる (to exist), in its past tense form いた. Sometimes ていた is used to express things that are still ongoing, but the speaker is not sure about, or would like to politely advise the listener about. This is very similar to the way in which English uses '(A) was doing (B)'. In this example, although the action of 'sitting' is not finished, we can imagine that the speaker is suggesting that 'dad was sitting here, and he still is, but he just went to get a drink'. The same kind of sentence could be used when the speaker has walked away from where their dad was sitting, and doesn't actually know if he is still sitting there or not.",N4
ていては,ていては,,"If one keeps doing something, When, If something is...","ていては is a structure often seen with verbs that will express that 'if one continues with (A), (B)'. In most cases, this will indicate a negative outcome. ていては is a combination of the て-form of a verb, 居 る 'to be' in its て-form, and は. The final ては is often considered its own conjunctive structure that may either exhibit hypothetical situations, or repetitive actions. In this case, it's a bit of a mix of both, depending on the verb it is attached to. Fun-fact Apart from the inclusion of ている to the base verb in order to show continuation, the ては in ていては is the same ては that appears with other set patterns such as てはいけない , てはならない , and てはだめ when expressing something negative.",N2
～ている間に,ているあいだに,,"While, During the time that ~","When (A) ている is paired with 間 に (B), it expresses that '(B) is happening/happened within the timeframe of (A)'. These events do not need to be related in any specific way, but the (B) action must happen somewhere within the duration of (A). This construction translates naturally as 'during the time that (A), (B)'. ている 間 に will often be used when the (B) action is somehow beyond the control of the speaker. However, this is not always the case. Fun Fact 間 literally means an 'interval', and therefore highlights the (A) event as being the 'whole' span of time, within which (B) happened/will happen at some point.",N4
～ている所だ,ているところだ,,In the process of doing ~ right now/at this moment,"In the previous grammar point, we learned that たところ (or ていたところ ) will mean 'just did (A)', or 'was just doing (A)'. ているところ works in a similar way, but expresses that someone is right in the middle of doing something. It is regularly translated as 'doing (A) right now', or 'in the process of (A)'. Caution Using ているところ will indicate that someone is 'busy with (A)', and would therefore not be used when changing actions suddenly. In these cases ているところ だった would be used, before the (B) phrase would further explain what happened next.",N4
～ている,ている①,prt,"Is, Am, Are (~ing)","ている is a construction used in Japanese to convey that someone or something is existing in a constant state of 'doing' the verb that comes before て . In English, depending on the verb, this can be translated as 'is (A)', 'am (A), or 'are (A)~ing'. The expression is made by adding いる to the て form of either る-Verbs , or う-Verbs . Due to いる being one of the verbs for 'existing' in Japanese, the ている form means something closer to 'continuing to exist in a specific state', rather than (A)~ing in English. This is why verbs like 死 ぬ , and 知 る , appear as the ている form in Japanese, when they would appear as the past form in English.",N5
～ている,ている②,prt,"State of being, Has (have) done","As mentioned in our first ている lesson, this construction is used to convey that someone or something is existing in a constant state of 'doing' the verb that comes before て . Here we will take a closer look at several of the verbs that will be used with ている , to express 'existing in a state of (A) having been done'. All of these verbs would appear as the past form in English, after the initial thing has 'started', 'come', 'died', or 'gotten angry'. However, this is not the case in Japanese. In Japanese, once something is angry, it exists in the state of being angry, once something has started, it exists in the state of being ongoing, once something dies, it exists in the state of being dead, and so on. Fun Fact One of the easiest ways that you can tell whether a verb will use the ている form, or the past form, is to think about whether it can happen twice. Something cannot 'start' twice, so it will use ている . Something cannot die twice, so it will use ている , etc. This does not work with every verb, but will help with over 90% of the verbs that require this form. Something has fallen and is already on the ground, so it cannot fall again. ている will be used.",N5
～ている,ている③,prt,"Has/have done, Is ~ing (Repetition)","The 3rd most common meaning (in no specific order) that ている is used for in Japanese, is the repetition of common activities. This is for things that are not 'continuing', but happen so often that they are considered to be continuous (like going to work, having a hobby, and similar things). Due to いる being one of the verbs for 'existing' in Japanese, the ている form is closer to 'continuing to exist in a specific state', rather than (A)~ing in English. In this construction, it can be thought of as 'to be existing in the state of performing a regular activity'. Caution With this meaning of ている , to make it easier to understand, expressions of time are often used. This can be things like 毎日 , 毎晩 , 毎週 , and similar phrases. Fun Fact Regularly in novels, manga, and specifically some parts of Japan, とる may be used instead of ている with the same meaning.",N5
～ておく,ておく,,To do something in advance,"When the conjunction particle て is followed by the う-Verb 置 く in Japanese, it regularly has the meaning of 'to do (A) in advance'. 置 く as a verb itself means 'to place something' (down), but also has the nuance 'to leave something alone', or to 'drop something' (like a topic). In this way, ておく can be thought of as meaning 'to do (A) and leave it (until later)'. When using ておく , the 'future event' that the (A) action is being done for may be something that is coming soon, or may be something that the speaker doesn't want to ever come. Due to this, ておく is also regularly used when the speaker is doing something specifically to prevent another thing from happening. Caution ておく is sometimes contracted to とく (or どく in verbs where て would usually be said as で ). Although this is not excessively common in conversation, it is very common in drama, manga, and similar media.",N4
てからでないと(),てからでないと,,"(Not) unless ~ cannot, (Not) until ~ cannot","Constructed from the て-form of verbs, から 'from', で, ない, and と, てからでないと is a grammar pattern that expresses that 'unless (A), (B) will not happen', or 'until (A), you cannot (B)'. Due to this, the (B) part of sentences that use this grammar pattern will always be negative. This structure simply indicates that (B) must come after (A). This could be in relation either to (A) and (B) being finished, or simply to (B) becoming possible after (A). Alternatively, the hypothetical ば form may be used instead of と. This will appear as てからでなければ . てからでないと can be thought of as an extension of the base てから grammar pattern that expresses that (B) only happens after (A).",N2
～てからと言うもの,てからというもの,,"After, Since, Ever since then","てからというもの is an extension of the grammar point てから meaning 'after (A)', and partners と 言 う 'that which is' with もの 'thing'. It is often translated as 'ever since (A)', and will always express a new state of (B) that has been ongoing since (A). Although the literal translation is 'with that which was from (A)', the fact that (B) is ongoing is simply implied. As with てから, this structure will be seen following verbs in their て-form. Although not quite as common, からというもの may be seen following それ, when それ is at the beginning of a new sentence. In these cases, それ will linked to what was stated in the previous sentence. Caution As this phrase implicitly highlights something that has remained ongoing ever since (A), it will not be used when (A) is something that only happened in the very recent past. However, because length of time is subjective, it usually depends on what is considered 'long' based on any specific outcome.",N1
～てから,てから,exp,"Once...is done, Once...happens, After doing","In order to specifically express that one thing happens/begins to happen after another thing, てから will be used. This expression is regularly translated as 'once (A) happens, (B)', or 'after doing (A), (B)'. The difference between てから , and the regular て form followed by another verb, is that てから puts more emphasis on the (A) action 'enabling' the (B) action. Caution から can come after almost any form of verb. てから is the only form that translates as 'after (A), (B)'. た から , and るから will translate closer to 'because', or 'since'.",N5
～て下さい,てください,exp,Please do (Polite request),"てください is a polite expression that is used for asking people to do something. It is most often translated as 'please do (A)'. ください is actually classified as honorific language , a type of polite speech that is used to refer to the actions of other people. くださる itself is the base form of this verb. While ください is exclusively used for making requests. くださる is the honorific language equivalent of くれる . In friendly conversation, ください can be omitted from this expression, and the て form itself can be used as a very casual way of saying 'please do (A)'.",N5
～てくる,てくる,,"To come to, To become, To continue, To be starting to, Has been ~ing","This grammar point is a combination of the conjunction particle て , and the verb 来 る 'to come'. To use this grammar point, you will need to attach て to any verb, and then follow it with くる . This nuance is usually that '(A) happened, and then came', or 'will happen, and then come'. In other words, it will depend on whether くる is in present, or past tense. てくる can be used when representing time, or when representing a physical place. When representing a physical place, it is more likely that the kanji structure, 来 る will be used. However, this is not a set rule, and depends on the writer. When used in relation to time, the nuance is usually that something has already come to pass, or will start to happen from now. This is the opposite of ていく , which indicates that something will change from the way that it is now, or will continue progressing in a certain way. Fun Fact When compared to English, てくる is very similar to the phrase 'to have come to (A)', in relation to time. This means that it focuses on the fact that the speaker will 'become (A)', should things continue in a specific way. In practice though, it is used like 'gotten' in most situations.",N4
～て,てくれない・てもらえない,,"Won't you?, Will you?, Could you?, Can you?, Would you?","When used in the negative, てくれない (coming from てくれる ),  and てもらえない (coming from てもらえる ), are similar to the negative question form of じゃないか . They express the following: てくれない - Would you not do (A) for me? てもらえない - Could I not have you do (A) for me? In both of these constructions. か (the question particle) may be omitted. However, they do sound slightly more polite when か is used. Let's examine the following list, for a scale of the level of politeness. てくれ , てくれる , てもらえる , てくれない（か） , てもらえない（か） Caution Despite the above list, てくれ may be considered a bit rude, and should be avoided in most situations.",N4
～てくれる,てくれる,,To do something for someone (usually you),"The verb 呉 れる in Japanese, is very similar to 与 える (to bestow). The primary difference is that 呉 れる (primarily written in hiragana) means to 'bestow to the speaker' (or someone in the speakers inner circle). In this way, てくれる is the opposite of てあげる , which conveys that someone (usually the speaker) gives (an action) to another person that is outside of their inner circle. てくれる is commonly translated as 'would you do (A) for me', as a question, or 'someone did (A) for me', as a statement. When asking for a favor, てくれる can be shortened to てくれ . However, this is very casual, and should not be used with strangers (or anyone that you do not know well). As an English equivalent, てくれ sounds similar to phrases like 'would ya do (A)', or 'could ya do (A)?' Fun Fact てくれる is one of the most casual ways to ask for a favor, with てもらう being slightly more polite. ていただく (the humble speech variation of てくれる ) is even more polite than either of these!",N4
てご覧(),てごらん,,"(Please) try to, (Please) look","てご 覧 is an honorific language expression in Japanese that is used in a similar way to なさい . It is usually translated as 'please try to (A)', where (A) is the verb that ご 覧 is connected to, through the use of the conjunction particle て. However, despite being translated as 'please try to (A)', the literal meaning of 覧 is 'to look', or 'to peruse' (to look at one's own leisure, without needing to rush). Due to this, てごらん can be thought of as being quite similar to てみる 'to try', but with the added emphasis of 'try as you like, when it suits you'. Caution As ご 覧 is honorific language , it cannot be used to refer to your own actions, or things that you will 'try'. It will only ever be used to make suggestions to other people about what they should try. Caution Sometimes ごらん and なさい will be paired together. This slightly increases the strength of the suggestion, and may be perceived as a very light command. Because of this, ごらんなさい is primarily used by superiors/elders, when requesting that a subordinate/younger person try something.",N3
～てしまう,てしまう・ちゃう,,"To do something by accident, To finish completely・totally, Unfortunately","By combining the conjunction particle て , with the verb しまう (sometimes written as 終 う ), you are able to express that something was done 'by accident', 'completely', or 'unfortunately'. These meanings may seem quite different, but we will discuss their similarities in a moment. Let's look at a few examples of てしまう first. As we can see, verbs that usually take で instead of て will be no different when using てしまう . Sometimes, てしまう or でしまう will be shortened to a more casual form, which are often used in speech. These forms are as follows: てしまう will become ちゃう でしまう will become じゃう Fun Fact While て 終 う is most frequently written in hiragana, て 仕舞 う may also be seen. There is a slight nuance difference between these two kanji structures, but the primary meaning of しまう will always be that 'something has come to the point where ending/ending up in a specific state cannot be avoided'. This 'no turning back point' may be temporary (likely to be written as 仕舞 う) , or it may be permanent (likely to be written as 終 う ). Due to this 'cannot be avoided' nuance, しまう often comes across as 'totally', as in 'ah… I totally left the chicken in the oven for too long'. In these cases, it is simply expressing the speaker's exasperation that something is 'too late' to change. However, despite regularly being used negatively, てしまう can also be used positively. In these cases it still has the nuance of 'no turning back'.",N4
～てしょうがない,てしょうがない,,"Extremely, Very, Really, It can't be helped","てしょうがない , is a common colloquial expression used when '(A) cannot be helped', or something is 'extremely (A)'. This structure is simply an abbreviated version of 仕様 , a noun meaning 'way' or 'method', as しょう is easier to say than しよう. Literally, the meaning is close to 'it's (A), and nothing can be done about it'. Generally, this just implies that the extent of (A) is so high that it cannot be overlooked, or cannot be avoided. This structure may be seen following the て-form of verbs, い-Adjectives, of the で-from of な-Adjectives. Alternatively, 仕方 がない may be used, but there is an extremely small difference between these two structures, with the noun 仕方 also meaning 'way' or 'method'. Traditionally, 仕方 がない is perceived to be slightly more polite, so may be more likely to be found in literature.",N2
～てすみません,てすみません,,I'm sorry for,"てすみません is a grammar construction that expresses the speaker's regret about (A). It is often translated directly to 'I'm sorry for (A)'. As discussed in one of our previous lessons on て , we examined the 'since', or 'due to' meaning that it can have. Let's look at a few examples. Phrases that use this particular (A) て (B) nuance of the て-form primarily express something that is beyond the control of the speaker in the (B) statement. Coming from the verb 済 む (to finish), すみません (the negated form) means 'to be unfinished'. In this way, てすみません literally means that the speaker feels that something is 'unfinished due to (A)'. This is very similar to phrases like 'having unfinished business' in English. Although the translation is 'I'm sorry', perhaps it would be easier to remember this grammar structure as highlighting someone's regret/unfinished feelings about (A), and simply showing that to the person that is being apologized to.",N4
～て堪らない',てたまらない,,"Can't help but want to, Very, Extremely","てたまらない is made up of the conjunction particle て, and the negated form of the う-Verb 堪 る meaning 'to bear', 'to endure', or 'to tolerate'. Common translations include 'to not be able to help wanting to (A)', or 'extremely (A)'. The primary difference between both meanings is that the 'can't help but want to (A)' nuance is seen attached to verbs conjugated with たい, while the 'extremely (A)' nuance is seen conjugated with both い and な-Adjectives. In both of these situations, the more literal interpretation is 'to be unbearably (A)'. As always, で will replace て when な-Adjectives are used.",N2
～てでも,てでも,,"Even if I have to, By any or all means, No matter what","てでも is a combination of the conjunction-particle て, and the prefix adverbial particle でも. Regular interpretations include 'no matter what', or 'even if I have to (A)'. When connected to verbs, てでも just emphasizes that 'even if (A) needs to be done, it will be', and expresses the speaker's strong determination to do something, regardless of what the consequences are, or how difficult it might be. Due to てでも expressing strong will, it will often be seen in sentences that include other phrases that mark desire or intent, such as ほしい, たい, and ようと 思 う. Fun-fact Although てでも is considered a fairly slang expression due to the use of てでも rather than the usual ても that would be expected of a verb, the construction itself of て-form partnered with an adverbial particle is quite common, and often marks emphasis or comparison. This can be seen very regularly with ては in patterns like てはいけない or てはだめ.",N2
～てならない,てならない,,"Very, Extremely, Can't help but do","てならない is a construction made up of the て-form of a verb or adjective (で for な-Adjectives), and the negated form of the う-Verb なる, 'to become'. This expression describes the word that is attached to it as being 'extremely (A)', or that one 'can't help but do (A)'. In most cases, てならない will be used when (A) is something that occurs naturally, such as feelings. Due to this, a more literal translation is close to 'to not be able to move on from (A)'. In this way, it just indicates that (A) is so intense that the person affected by it cannot do anything about it. Caution In addition to being spontaneous and uncontrollable, (A) will almost always be something that is ongoing, rather than just being momentary.",N2
～てはいけない,てはいけない,v-unspec,"Must not, May not","てはいけない is used in Japanese to express that (A) 'cannot', or 'must not' be done. It is the combination of a verb in て form, the は particle, and the negative potential form of 行 く (to be able to go). In this way, it literally means '(A) cannot/is not able to go'. Although は can be dropped from many phrases and expressions, the は in this particular grammar point is usually not. This is because いけない would then become the second action in a sequence of events (the usual function of て form). However, to make this more casual, て は is often changed to ちゃ (ては becomes ちゃ), or じゃ (では becomes じゃ), as this is easier to say. Caution Apart from いけない ; ならない and だめ are also frequently used to get across the same meaning. However, they are used in different situations. いけない - Fairly neutral. Used in both spoken and written language. ならない - Fairly formal. Used mostly in written language. だめ - Very casual. Used almost exclusively in spoken language.",N5
～ては居られない',てはいられない,,"Can't afford to, Unable to","てはいられない is a grammar pattern which consists of the conjunction-particle て, は, and the negated-potential form of the る-Verb いる 'to be'. Common translations include 'to be unable to (A)', and 'cannot afford to (A)'. The literal meaning of 'to not be able to be with (A)' just reflects the impossibility of the word that this structure is attached to. This structure is almost exclusively seen with verbs, but may occasionally be seen with い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns as well. The verb that てはいられない is connected to is often considered to be something that cannot continue on due to either some time-based or feeling-based limitation. In this way, it regularly has the nuance of '(A) cannot continue due to (B)', with the reason of (B) mentioned in another part of the sentence. When appearing with い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns, the nuance will change slightly, and simply reflects the meaning of いられない itself in conveying that (A) 'cannot be', or is 'impossible' in some way. As always, ては will be replaced by では in the case of nouns and な-Adjectives.",N2
ては叶わない',てはかなわない,,"It's unbearable when, It'd be unbearable if, I can't stand it when, I couldn’t stand it if","In order to convey that something is undesirable, the grammar structure てはかなわない may be used. This combines the conjunction particle て, the adverbial particle は, and the negative form of the う-Verb 叶 う ‘to grant (a wish)’, or ‘to realize (a goal)’. This may be interpreted as ‘it’s unbearable when (A)’, or ‘I can’t stand it when (A)’. However, the literal translation is ‘it’s not a dream come true for (A)’. When used following verbs, the (A) verb is often in the passive. This indicates that the speaker does not like being the target or victim of (A). However, standard verb structures may also be seen. In addition to this, てはかなわない may follow the conjunctive form of い-Adjectives, or appear as ではかなわない when following な-Adjectives. Caution Although many grammar structures frequently appear in hiragana, making their original kanji hard to identify, it will be important not to mix up 叶 う ‘to grant’ with 敵 う ‘to be a match for’. Grammatically, these verbs are both used quite differently.",N1
～ては成らない,てはならない,,"Must not, Cannot, Should not","Although なくてはならない 'must do' is introduced to many learners early on, てはならない by itself carries the meaning of 'must not do', or 'cannot do'. This structure is a combination of the conjunction particle て, は, and the negated form of the う-Verb なる. Despite this ならない by itself is often considered a standalone word which may indicate that something is 'not possible', 'not permitted', or 'cannot be helped', depending on what type of word it is following. When following verbs and ては, ならない can only mean 'cannot', or 'must not'. Caution As a reminder, in the order from most casual to most formal, てはだめ, てはいけない , and てはならない will often be seen in sentences with no significant difference in meaning. Due to the ならない variant being the most formal, it is also the most likely to be seen in writing or polite speech.",N2
～ては〜ては,ては〜ては,,"Repeating action, If, Since","Another structure making use of the combined て and は particles is ては～ては . This grammar pattern highlights that the actions of (A) and (B) are continuously being repeated and can be interpreted as 'doing (A) and (B) repeatedly'. The (A) and (B) actions will often be things that contrast each other in some respect, such as starting and stopping, walking and running, going forwards and then backwards, etc. ては～ては will be used with verbs in the て-form, so will occasionally appear as では. The abbreviated versions of ちゃ and じゃ may also be seen with the grammar point, but it may be considered unnatural if the same abbreviation is not used both times. This is mainly due to the level of formality being required to stay the same within sentences. Caution ては may sometimes appear only once, without any change to the meaning of repetition. This is usually when there is some indication in the rest of the sentence that the action is something that is being repeated over and over.",N2
～ては,ては,,"If, With, Since, Because","When the particles て and は are combined, they form a regular composite structure that is used primarily to highlight repeating actions, or to make assessments or judgments about potential situations. In this grammar structure, we will be looking at the nuance that is used with potential situations. This may be interpreted simply as 'if (A), (B)', 'when (A), (B)', or 'because of (A), (B)'. At times when used as 'if', ては will generally express some sort of negative expectation or comment. Depending on what ては appears after, では may be used instead. This is the case when following nouns, な-Adjectives, or verbs that require で to be used instead of て when conjugating. As with many other structures that use ては or では , it will often be shortened to じゃ or ちゃ .",N2
～て欲しい,てほしい,,I want you to,"As mentioned in our lesson about 'saying that you want something' with がほしい , sometimes ほしい can be used as auxiliary adjective (an adjective that needs to be connected to another word in order to have meaning). In these cases, it will follow the conjunction particle , て . When used this way, てほしい expresses that the speaker 'wants somebody to do something'. To use てほしい , simply change the verb that you 'want someone to do' into its て-form , and then add ほしい. Caution てほしい can also be used to ask questions/explain about what other people want you (or somebody else) to do. Due to this, we will need to be careful when trying to identify who wants who to do what.",N4
～てみる,てみる,,To try to,"In order to express that you will (or someone else should) try something, the conjunction particle て will be paired with 見 る (almost always without kanji). While this is translated as 'to try to (A)', the actual meaning is closer to 'to do (A), and see (whether the result is good or not)'. This grammar construction is usually only used when someone tries something for the first time. As mentioned above, this phrase is also used when suggesting that someone else should try something. In these situations, (A) + てみて , or more formally, (A) + てみてください will be used. Sometimes, in very casual situations, even the て will be dropped, and (A) + てみ will be used by itself. This usually has the nuance of 'come on, just give it a go!' Caution When てみた appears in the past tense, it will imply that the attempt was successful, unless specifically stated otherwise by the speaker. Fun Fact While the kanji for 見 る may be used in this grammar point, it will result in the 'see' meaning being heavily stressed (rather than 'try'). This may cause a misunderstanding on the part of the person listening/reading.",N4
～てもいい,てもいい,exp,"It is alright/fine/okay even if, Can/may, ~ is also okay","Noun, い-Adjective , or な-Adjective + てもいい is a construction in Japanese that is used to express that something is 'okay', or 'alright'. It is also frequently used as a question to ask if you 'can', or 'may' do something. As can be seen, with い-Adjectives , we will need to use the conjugation form. This is created by removing the い and then replacing it with く. This phrase is also regularly used without the も , but is considered a bit more direct/casual in those cases. It is best to remove the も only when talking to people that you know well. てもいい is an expression that literally means て (noun, etc) も (also) いい (is good). Similarly to the てもいい grammar point that is used with verbs, this variant may also be used as a question. To do this, you simply need to follow てもいい with です か , or the more casual の .",N5
～ても構わない,てもかまわない,,"It doesn't matter if, I don't mind","ても 構 わない is often used to express that something 'doesn't matter', or that the speaker 'doesn't mind'. This structure is a combination of ても (with verbs and い-Adjectives ), or でも (with nouns and な-Adjectives ) grouped with the negative conjugation of the う - Verb 構 う, which means 'to brace'. Literally, this expression can be thought of as being similar to 'to not be uptight'. However, it is almost always simply used to convey that there is no issue with something. ても 構 わない may be used with any type of word that appears in its ても or でも conjugation form. Fun Fact 構 う is usually translated as 'to brace', but the kanji 構 often has the nuance of 'to posture', or 'to pose' (into some type of strong/resistant shape). In the ても 構 わない grammar structure, this translates as (A) simply being something that will not cause the speaker to 'posture', 'position', or 'pose' themselves in a resistant way.",N3
～てもらう,てもらう,,"To get someone to do, To have someone do","Being slightly more direct than てくれる , てもらう removes the meaning of 'to bestow' (to the speaker), and focuses on the meaning of 'to receive' (from the giver). With てもらう , に will mark the person that 'did something' for the subject, while が (or は ) will highlight the receiver themselves. In English, this grammar structure is regularly translated as 'to have (someone) do (A) for you', or 'to get (someone) to do (A) for you'. Literally, it means 'to receive the action of (A)'. てもらう is also regularly used when receiving a service from someone, as てくれる would imply that the action was a favor.",N4
ても差し支えない,ても差し支えない,,"May, Is bit a bother if, Do you mind if, Is it a problem if","ても 差 し 支 えない is a polite expression used in a similar way to てもいい 'may I', or 'do you mind'. This is a combination of ても (or でも when following nouns or な-Adjectives), and the る-Verb 差 し 支 える 'to interfere', or 'to hinder' in its negative form, 差 し 支 えない. It may be used either for asking for or granting permission. Due to this pattern being polite, ありません will almost always be used in place of ない by itself. The more literal translation is 'it is not a hindrance if (A)'. In cases where permission is being asked for, か will be added to the end of ありません. Caution Although ても 差 し 支 える is used in polite sentences, the verb 差 し 支 える itself is not strictly reserved for use in polite language, and will appear in sentences when implying that (A) has or will have a negative impact on (B).",N1
～ても～なくても,～ても～なくても,,Whether ~ or not,"Like かどうか , another way that Japanese conveys 'whether or not' is through the use of ～ても～なくても. This grammar structure literally means 'even if (A), even if not (A)', to show that whatever the result is will not change, regardless of (A). ～ても～なくても is used primarily with verbs, and will always have the same verb appearing both before ても and なくても.",N3
～ても,ても,,"Even if, Even though","The combination of the conjunction particle て (or the case-marking particle で ), with the adverbial particle も , often has the nuance of 'even if (A)', or 'even though (A)'. To use this structure, simply conjugate a verb or い-Adjective into its て-form , and then add も . For nouns and な-Adjectives , でも will be used instead. This grammar pattern may also be used for highlighting negative sentences, and will translate similarly to 'even if not (A)', or 'even though not (A)' in these cases. Fun Fact でも (the form after nouns and な-Adjectives ) is often considered to be an adverbial particle itself, and there is often debate amongst native speakers as to whether でも is actually a word, or simply a standard grouping of で , the case marking particle and も , the adverbial particle . However, It may be easier to remember でも as its own word, for learning purposes.",N4

～て止まない,てやまない,,"Never cease to, Always, Sincerely, Greatly, From the bottom of one's heart","～てやまない is a formal construction that combines the て-form of a verb with the negative form of the う-Verb 止 む 'to cease', or 'to desist'. The literal meaning of 'to not stop (A)', or 'to not desist (A)' is often translated as 'to always (A)', or 'to (A) from the bottom of one's heart'. It is an expression that is used exclusively in relation to feelings and emotions. Common words that may be partnered with やまない include 愛 'love', 敬愛 'love and respect', 願 う 'to wish for', 祈 る 'to hope for', 望 む 'to have ambitions for', 希望 'wish', 期待 'anticipation', 尊敬 'respect', 信 じる 'to trust', and several more. Either positive or negative emotions may be used. Caution As やまない emphasizes the continuation of something, てやまない will not be used with feelings that are temporary, such as (temporary) anger, or (temporary) disappointment.",N1
～てやる,～てやる,,"Just wait and see, Just you wait, To do a favor, For you, Definitely, For sure","The う-Verb やる, occasionally seen in the kanji form 遣 る, primarily means ‘to do’, but can also mean ‘to give’ as the casual form of あげる. When attached to the て-form of verbs, it acts as a subsidiary verb . When substituting for あげる, it will often sound patronizing, or that the speaker is doing an action because it is unavoidable, and the person they are doing it for cannot do it themselves. This will be translated as ‘to do for’. In other cases, やる acts more like 見 せる ‘to show’, and indicates the speaker’s strong will to perform an action. In these cases, it will be translated as ‘I will do (A), just wait and see’, or ‘I’ll definitely do (A)’. However, in either the place of あげる or みせる, the underlying meaning is just ‘to do’, with emphasis on the doer being the person that is in power over the result of the action due to their superiority.",N1
～てよかった,てよかった,,I'm glad that,"When て (or で when following ない) is paired with the past form of the い-Adjective , いい ; てよかった , なくて よかった , or ないで よかった will have the meaning of 'I'm glad that (A)' (when positive), or 'I'm glad that I didn't (A)' (when negative). The primary difference between なくて よかった and ないで よかった in this expression, is that ないで よかった will be used far more frequently in casual speech. Comparatively, なくて よかった tends to be reserved for books, and may even be considered old-fashioned by some people.",N4
～て初めて,て初めて,,"For the first time, Not until, Only after, Only when, Only because","て 初 めて is an expression in Japanese that highlights one verb as being the catalyst for some particular result/state. Verb て 初 めて literally means 'with (A) done, for the first time (B)'. Often, this translates similarly to 'only after I (A) did I (B)', or 'not until (A) did I (B)'. In this structure, it should be noted that the (A) verb is not necessarily being done for the first time ever, just that this time resulted in the speaker's first experience of (B). Caution Originally, 始 めて 'commencing with' and 初 めて 'starting with' were both used with this expression. However, this is considered incorrect in modern Japanese, as only 初 めて strictly carries the meaning of 'for the first time'.",N3
～て当然だ,て当然だ,,"Natural, As a matter of course","て 当然 だ is a commonly used expression which indicates that '(A) is natural', or '(A) is a matter of course'. This is a combination of the て-form of either verbs of い-Adjectives (or で when used with nouns), the noun 当然 'naturally', and だ. て 当然 だ is a fairly strong phrase, and will often be used when pointing out things that the speaker considers to be obvious facts.",N2
である,である,,"Formal or literary だ, Authoritative, Copula","である (or であります ) is a construction in Japanese that is considered to be the formal equivalent of だ . This should not be confused with the polite speech word です , as である is simply a combination of the conjunctive form of だ , and the う - Verb, ある. である may be used in any place that だ would usually be used, but is most likely to be found at the end of sentences/statements. Fun Fact Because the な that is used with な-Adjectives is simply the attributive form of だ , である may replace な or の when connecting one noun to another. The attributive form just means the form of a word that can be directly linked to a noun. As ある's attributive form is just ある, it does not need to be modifed at all. However, although this is grammatically correct, it would sound quite stiff in many circumstances, and should be avoided in standard speech. Caution であります (as opposed to である ) is very formal, and will almost exclusively be used by people within jobs that absolutely require this level of formality (politics, police force, military, etc). Due to this, its use within regular conversation will sound stiff, or perhaps even like the speaker is jokingly being over polite.",N3
であれ〜であれ,であれ〜であれ,,"Whether or, Or, No matter which, In either case","Functioning as an extension of である, the formal copula that is a combination of the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb だ, and the う-Verb ある, であれ or であろうと will be used in order to express strong will or conviction. あれ is simply the imperative form of ある, while あろうと is the positive volitional form combined with the case marking particle と. Both structures are usually translated as 'even if (A), (B)', or 'no matter if (A), (B)'. Despite this, the more literal meaning of each is closer to 'so it's (A), (B) still won't be affected'. This just emphasizes the fact that (A) is of no relation to the result, like saying 'so what if it is' in English. When used consecutively, であれ shows that regardless of whether something is (A) or (B), the result of (C), will not change. Both であれ and であろうと will primarily attach to nouns in sentences that express some kind of question or assumption through words like どんな or たとえ. Caution Although ～であれ～であれ implies 'no matter whether it is (A) or (B)', both (A) and (B) in these types of sentences usually fall under the same category, as (C) needs to be something that links them logically. For example (A) may be 'a plane', and (B) may be 'a submarine', while (C) will be describing something about them both being vehicles.",N1
であれ,であれ,,"Even if, Even, No matter","Functioning as an extension of である , the formal copula that is a combination of the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb だ, and the う-Verb ある, であれ or であろうと will be used in order to express strong will or conviction. あれ is simply the imperative form of ある, while あろうと is the positive volitional form combined with the case-marking particle と. Both structures are usually translated as 'even if (A), (B)', or 'no matter if (A), (B)'. Despite this, the more literal meaning of each is closer to 'so it's (A), (B) still won't be affected'. This just emphasizes the fact that (A) is of no relation to the result, like saying 'so what if it is' in English. Both であれ and であろうと will primarily attach to nouns in sentences that express some kind of question or assumption through words like どんな or たとえ. As both であれ and であろうと use structures that indicate strong will, these grammar patterns will frequently be used in sentences where the speaker is expressing their opinions or resolutions.",N1
できれば,できれば・できたら,,If possible,"Remembering that する has no potential form, the replacement る - Verb できる 'to amount to' will often be used in conjunction with particles, to indicate whether the possibility of amounting to something exists. The conjunction particles ば or たら will most frequently be used. できれば and できたら are usually translated simply as 'if possible'. Both できれば and できたら will come at the start of a sentence, before the following statement will express some (desired) outcome. Caution As ば and たら are the only 'hypothetical' indicators that can express the process toward potential outcomes, using なら or と would be be illogical. This can be visualized as follows: (A) できると - Will express the result after achieving (A), not what is required to get there. (A) できるなら - As なら is just the hypothetical form of だ, It is used to make guesses about what could happen if the situation of (A) exists, not how that situation can be used to produce some other result.",N3
で御座います,でございます,,"To be, Polite copula","As mentioned briefly in the ございます lesson, でございます is a structure which can be used as a replacement for であります , the polite form of である (which itself is the formal equivalent of だ ). Both です and でございます are considered polite speech . However, でございます is the more polite of the two. Let's take a look at a few examples. でござる may also be seen, as it is the base form of で + ございます a (special-class) verb. However, in modern Japanese, this is primarily restricted to historical dramas, or characters that have a somewhat 'quirky' personality. Fun Fact Using でございます to introduce yourself is considered quite polite, however, when referring to other people, いらっしゃる 'to be' is preferred, as honorific language is more respectful than polite speech .",N4
でしかない,でしかない,,"Merely, Nothing but, No more than","でしかない is a construction comprised of the conjunctive form of だ, で, the particle しか, and the い-Adjective, ない. Like all other しか based structures, it is used to indicate that the target word is 'no more than (A)', or 'merely (A)'. The primary difference with でしかない compared to other similar grammar patterns is that it will only appear directly after nouns. Although でしかない can be used with either a positive or negative nuance, it tends to be seen more frequently with a slightly negative nuance in relation to (A), indicating that it has no value or significant meaning beyond (A).",N2
でしょう,でしょう,aux-v,"Right?, Probably, Isn't it?","でしょう is a conjugated form of です , and can also be seen in the contracted form でしょ (more casual). でしょう is regularly translated to 'right?', or 'probably' in English. In a broader sense it just expresses an assertion about something (like です ), that the speaker assumes the listener would probably agree with. In the above, we can see that, in both examples, the speaker is looking for confirmation that/affirming that the listener agrees with them. As でしょう is a conjugation of です (the polite form of だ), it usually follows the plain form of words, rather than words using ～ます. However, in very formal situations, or older literature ～ます でしょう may be seen. Caution Despite sounding relatively low confidence, using でしょう implies that the speaker has some form of information that makes them believe that the (A) statement is true.",N5
です,です,aux-v,"To be, Is","Similarly to だ , です is an auxiliary verb that is an expression of determination or assertion. It states that something 'is' a certain way. です is considered to be the polite variation of だ . Keep in mind though that although their roles are similar, both だ and です are standalone structures. です connects to words in exactly the same way as だ , but is also regularly seen attached to the end of い-Adjectives . Caution Although です is regularly attached to the end of い-Adjectives , some may actually consider this incorrect Japanese, and it should not be used in formal writing. In daily spoken language/texting, however, it is completely normal. The above example technically should not be used in formal writing. Despite this, in recent years, it is starting to become the norm.",N5
でできる,でできる・からできる,,"Made of, Made from, Produced from, Come from","でできる , or からできる are two structures that share very similar meanings. Basically, they both mean '(B) was made from/out of (A)'. These constructions highlight the 'ingredients', or 'materials' that something is/was made out of. Let's look at some examples. から and で are both case marking particles in this grammar point, and while they express much the same thing when translated into English, there is a slight nuance difference. These differences are as follows: から - Literally 'prepared from'. Tends to be used more frequently when the material is not obvious at first glance. May also put focus on the ingredients/materials before there was any alteration. で - Literally 'prepared with'. Tends to be used more frequently when the materials are more obvious. Despite this, recent generations use で in most situations, regardless of if the material is visible at first glance or not. As a result, でできる and からできる are almost indistinguishable in modern Japanese. Caution There is also a small nuance difference between できる , and できている , when used as part of this construction. できる is usually used when talking about something broadly 'everything in category (B) is made from (A)', while できている is used more frequently when examining a specific item 'this particular (B) is made from (A)'. Like the difference between で and から though, they are largely interchangeable.",N4
でなくてなんだろう,でなくてなんだろう,,If … is not … then what is?,"でなくてなんだろう is a formal pattern that appears following nouns that the speaker is certain is something which is true. It can be translated as 'if it's not (A), then what is it?'. でなくてなんだろう is a combination of the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb だ, で, the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective ない, なくて, the prefix なん 'what', and the volitional form of だ, だろう. As can be seen, the literal and common translations are quite similar. Occasionally でなくてなんだろう will be followed by the sentence-ending particle か. This just emphasizes the point further, without changing the nuance. In most cases, でなくてなんだろう will be used to ask a rhetorical question, or to strongly assert the speaker's own opinion about something.",N1
ではなくて,ではなくて・じゃなくて,,"Not A but B, Conjunctive","When the auxiliary verb だ is seen in its negative conjugated form, it states that (A) is not correct, but (B) is. This form is ではなく , and may appear either with or without the conjunction particle て attached to the end. ではなくて is commonly seen grouped with nouns, or other words that have been nominalized through the use of の or こと. In ではなくて , the adverbial particle は is not strictly required. However, as this expression is comparing what (A) is 'not' to what (B) 'is', the contrast that は provides means that the phrase will sound far more natural with its inclusion. Caution て sometimes performs in a similar way to a 'comma' in Japanese, allowing structures to appear together that usually wouldn't. Due to this, if て is omitted from ではなくて , ではなく may not be linked directly to the next word, and a comma will be required. Regarding adjectives, this く form is known as the conjunctive form , and may only be linked directly with other 用言 (conjugatable words), altering or adding to their overall meaning.",N3
それでは,では・それでは・じゃあ,,"If so, Well (then), In that case","では and じゃあ are both abbreviations of それでは , and used as conjunctions in Japanese. This structure may be considered as a combination of それ , the case marking particle で, and the binding (adverbial) particle は, but is commonly treated as a single word. それでは has two primary functions. It can be used to continue in the same topic, showing that '(B) is a result of (A)'. Or it may be used to change the conversation topic completely, showing that '(A) is at a good point to become (B)'. In each of these cases, it can be translated as 'and with that' in English. 'If so', 'well then', and 'in that case' are also common translations. The translation of 'in that case' is most commonly used when one person is making an assumption/drawing a conclusion about something that someone else has just said. Fun Fact それでは , では , and じゃあ are also frequently used as a polite way to say 'goodbye'. In these situations, it comes across in a similar way to 'well…. I best be off' in English.",N3
でもある,でもある,,"Be also, It also is","As an extension of the formal version of the auxiliary verb だ, である , でもある simply conveys that something 'is also (B)'. However, as も often shows something that is surprising or unexpected, でもある will primarily be used to describe additional facts about (A) that may be unexpected. Due to this, でもある usually fills the (B) role in sentences like 'while (A), it is also (B)', or 'in spite of (A), it is also (B)'. でもある may be used after nouns, or な-Adjectives .",N3
でもなんでもない,でもなんでもない,,"Not at all, By no means, Definitely not, Nothing like that, Not really","でもなんでもない is a structure seen after nouns or な-Adjectives in Japanese to indicate that something is 'definitely not (A)', or 'not (A) at all'. This is a combination of the adverbial particle でも 'even', the adverb 何 でも 'whatever' or 'anything at all', and the い-Adjective ない 'not'. Due to this, the literal translation of 'not even (A) or anything of the sort' reflects the desired nuance. でもなんでもない may be used either positively or negatively. When being used positively, it often has the translation of '(A) is no big deal'. Caution Although not as common, some sources list the conjunctive form of い-Adjectives partnered with もなんでもない as another possibility.",N1
でも〜でも,〜でも,,"Whether ~ or, Neither ~ or","When the adverbial particle でも is used more than once in a sequence, it is an extension of one of its regular meanings, analogical reasoning . However, several 'analogies' are being presented. This use of でも is regularly translated as 'whether it is (A), or (B)', or 'neither (A) nor (B)', depending on whether the rest of the phrase is positive, or negative. Literally, the translation of 〜でも〜でも is closer to the following: Even if it's (A), even if it's (B), (C) is the result. (In a positive sentence) Even if it's (A), even if it's (B), (C) is not the result. (In a negative sentence)",N4
でも,でも,,"Or something,  Any... (with question words), No matter (who)","でも is one of many adverbial particles in Japanese. These are particles that behave like a regular 助詞 (in that they appear after the words that they are referencing), but their role is a little bit more specific. でも itself has several uses, and the use that we will examine in this grammar point is called 例示 . Basically this means 'presenting examples'. In English, this results in a translation similar to 'even', or 'or something'. To use this structure, simply attach でも to the end of any noun , or pronoun . When grouped with a standard noun as above, でも is just showing that the noun is an example/suggestion, and that there are other choices/possibilities available. However, when the noun is a word like 誰 , どこ , 何 , or いつ, the translation becomes much closer to English words like 'anyone', 'anywhere', 'anything', or 'anytime'. Fun Fact There is debate among Japanese native speakers about whether でも should be considered its own word, or if it is actually just a combination of the particles で and も (or て and も in the case of verbs, but we will cover that later). As で and も together could be translated as 'even with (A)', it would also be correct to consider it this way. Caution When grouped with 何 , the pronunciation will almost always change to なん. This is purely to make なんでも easier to say.",N4
で良ければ,でよければ,,"If it is alright, If you don't mind, If you would like, If possible","でよければ is an expression that is constructed with the case marking particle で, and the potential form of the い-Adjective いい , よければ. The literal meaning of 'if with (A) is good/fine', or 'if by (A) is good/fine' is quite similar to the standard translation, which is 'if (A) is ok'. でよければ will always follow nouns or noun-phrases. でよければ is a phrase that is often used in relation to oneself, in order to politely offer some sort of help, advice, or service. As で is being used in its standard meaning of 'with' or 'by', でよければ implies that the speaker is enquiring whether the quality/ability of (A) is good enough to achieve some specific result.",N3
で言うと,で言うと,,"In, Of, According to","でいうと is an expression in Japanese that is commonly used to ask questions, or to give information about how one thing corresponds with another. It is a combination of the case marking particle で meaning 'with', and 言 うと meaning 'if said', or 'if we say'. This structure will be seen after nouns, and can be translated as 'if said with (A), (B)'. でいうと will often be seen in sentences with に 当 たる 'to be equivalent to', another common grammar structure used for drawing connections between things. Fun Fact 一言 で 言 うと is a set expression that means 'to put it in a word', 'in short', or 'to sum up'.",N3
で,で,prt,"With, By (using)","で is a particle that has several different uses in Japanese. At its core, it is always used to highlight something that is 'required' to perform some sort of action/reach some kind of goal. One of these uses relates to 'things'. This comes across as 'by' or 'with' in English. In these sentences, the item is considered essential for the action to be performed. While other items may be used, で simply highlights the one that was chosen. で is also used when groups of people perform actions together, this is something that many people learning Japanese have trouble with initially (because と may also be used as 'with' for people). However, the use of で is actually the same as this by/with, meaning that the speaker considers the group as the tool used for performing the action. The difference between と and で as 'with', is that で is used when everyone in the group has the same objective/end goal. と is used when each person is performing the action toward each other, not toward an external objective.",N5
で,で,prt,"At, In","で is a particle that has several different uses in Japanese. At its core, it is always used to highlight something that is ' required ' to perform some sort of action. One of these uses relates to places, and translates roughly as 'at', or 'in' in English. In these sentences, the place is considered essential for the action to be performed, or the result of the action to be achieved. This is unlike the particle に , which marks the location itself as being the destination or target of an action. Basically, で means (A) 'place' allows (B) 'action' to occur. While に means (A) 'place' is the target for (B) 'action' occurring. In the first example, we can see that に marks the place that the person exists during an action, but the action itself is not dependent on the place. In the second example, the action is considered dependent on being at that place, as there are possibly no barbeques in other areas.",N5
とあって...(,とあって,exp,"Since...(it is no wonder that), Because...(it is no wonder that), Due to...(it is no wonder that)","とあって is a formal grammar expression that combines the case marking particle と with the て-form of ある 'to be'. It is used to present an unusual situation from which an obvious result will or has occurred. It is often translated as 'since (A), it is no wonder that (B)', or 'because of (A), it's natural that (B)'. とあって is usually seen following almost any word in their standard forms , but な-Adjectives will require a だ to come between them and とあって . This construction can be thought of as similar to として 'as', but with focus more on 'what (A) is or is viewed as', emphasized through ある, rather than 'how (A) conducts itself or is conducted', emphasized through する. Caution とあって is only used objectively, and will not refer to the speaker or writer themselves.",N1
とあれば(),とあれば,,"(Emphatic) if, If it is the case that, As (you wish)","とあれば is a grammar pattern in Japanese that is used as an emphatic version of なら 'if'. It will primarily be used in formal situations, or for literary effect, such as in a novel. It may be translated as 'if (A) is the case, then (B)', or 'should (A) be true, then (B)'. This is a combination of the case-marking particle と, and the hypothetical form of the う-Verb ある 'to be', あれば. とあれば will primarily follow nouns, but is occasionally also seen after other structures such as verbs and adjectives when the と is being used as a quotation . (A) is often some special circumstance or condition that leads to the conclusion or assumption of (B), were (A) to be accurate. As this expression is emphatic, (B) will usually indicate something that must be done, or can't be avoided with structures like しかない, なければならない, ざるを得ない, etc. Fun Fact とあれば tends to appear with のため before it quite often. This can be translated as 'if for the purpose of (A)', and will describe the lengths that the speaker is willing to go for (A) in (B).",N1
といい,といい,,"I hope, I wish, You should, It would be good","One of the regular uses of the と particle is to express 'if'. However, unlike some other structures (like なら , たら , and ば ), と implies that the 'if' result of と is something that will definitely happen, or is a natural consequence of (A) happening. When combined with the い-Adjective いい, it means 'if (A), it would be good'. This construction may be used with any phrase ending in a word in its standard form . Because と expresses a 'certain' outcome, the 'good' in this grammar construction often sounds quite strong, leading to といい regularly being translated closer to 'I hope (A)', or 'I wish (A)'. There are several situations in which this grammar point can be used to express that you are hoping something for yourself, or hoping something for someone else. This is primarily determined by the use of な, or ん だけど (hoping for yourself), or ね (hoping for others/mutual benefit). Caution When this expression finishes with けど , けれども , or が , it can imply that there are some external factors that will make the desired result difficult to achieve.",N4
と言う事だ,ということだ,,"I heard that, Rumor has it that, It is said that, It means that","Like ということ, an expression used for nominalizing a phrase in the fashion of 'the ~ that ~', ということだ makes use of the auxiliary verb だ (or です ), and stresses that the nominalized phrase 'is' the case. This phrase is often translated as 'I heard that', or 'it is said that', but literally, it is closer to 'it is that it's ~'. The だ is what gives this expression a high degree of certainty, therefore implying that the speaker has heard the statement elsewhere, and is sure of its validity. ということだ can be added to the end of any phrase that the speaker wants to highlight as being something that is known. ということだ is regularly paired with other expressions that show the 'source' of information, such as によると, or によれば . When ということだ is being used to express hearsay (statements that cannot easily be proven), it can be rephrased as とのことだ. The literal difference between these two phrases is as follows: ということだ - It can be explained that (A) is ~ (more emphasis on the information). とのことだ - The statement of (A) has been applied to ~ (more emphasis on the source that 'applied' the information). Caution ということだ is considered to be more formal than そうだ when reporting information that has been heard from another source. This is primarily due to ということだ expressing something that is thought to be a fact, while そうだ retains the nuance of being something that is a speculation/guess.",N3
と言う事は,ということは,,"That means, That is to say","ということは is a phrase in Japanese that often appears in the middle of sentences, expressing that the previous statement is something that is about to be clarified. This can be translated as 'that means', or 'that is to say'. ということは based sentences will often finish with ということだ , although it is not limited to appearing this way. The more literal translation is something similar 'that which is said to be (A), (B)'. In this way, it simply presents (A) as a thing that requires further explaining. Additionally, ということは will appear at the beginning of sentences, when the speaker is confirming their understanding about something that has just been said. Often in the form of a question. In these cases, the translation is similar 'so you mean to say that (A)?'. As can be seen from the breakdown of という, こと, and は, this statement just expresses that the 'thing' which is 'classified as' (A) is 'in general' understood to be (B).",N2
と言う事,ということ,,"~ing, The ~ that ~ (Nominalization)","One of the ways to perform nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun) in Japanese is through the use of the expression ということ . This grammar point is a combination of と (the particle), 言 う (the verb), and こと (the noun). Together, the literal translation is close to 'that (A) is said to be'. However, in reality, it sounds far less formal than this. To use ということ , attach it to the end of any phrase (without です , or ます). In most cases it will be written using hiragana. In conversation, という is regularly shortened to simply って . This form will be heard/seen much more frequently in conversation/manga and similar things. ということ is also frequently used when clarifying what someone else has said. In these cases, it translates very similarly to 'you mean that (A)?', or 'you mean to say that (A)?' Caution Although the kanji 言 う and 事 may be used in this expression, the most common form does not use any kanji at all. This is a regular occurance in Japanese, as many set grammatical structures will not use kanji, simply because it makes the pattern easier to identify.",N4
と言うところ,というところ,,"I would say (about), I guess (about), It could be said that, About, at best","というところ is a grammar expression that is used when highlighting an approximate number or degree for something. It is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the う-Verb 言 う 'to say', and the noun ところ 'place', which often marks situations. Common translations include 'I would say about (A)', 'I guess about (A)'. A more literal translation is 'To be at the point where saying (A) is accurate'. It is most common for this structure to appear following either verbs or nouns, but may also occasionally follow adjectives. Coming primarily at the end of sentences, というところ will often be followed immediately by the auxiliary verb だ or です. Occasionally, という will be replaced by the past-tense form, といった. However, the meaning does not change at all in these cases. Caution というところ has a tendency to be used when the number being given is the theoretical maximum for something, rather than the theoretical minimum. Due to this, it may sound unnatural when wanting to present an approximate minimum.",N1
と言うのは事実だ,～というのは事実だ,,"It is a fact that ~, There is no doubt that","～というのは 事実 だ is a phrase used to strongly express that (A) is something that is 'true', 'a fact', or has 'no doubt'. というのは may be used after almost any phrase, before the noun 事実 'truth', paired with the auxiliary verb だ (or です ) will determine that phrase to be a fact. The literal translation というのは 事実 だ is 'that which is (A) is true', as (A) is just a nominalized phrase. It is also quite common to see this expression with という omitted, the only difference being that it sounds slightly weaker.",N3
と言うのは~,というのは,,"~ Known as ~ is, ~ Called ~ is, ~ Means ~, Because","というのは is a phrase that combines the case marking particle と,  the う - Verb 言 う,  and the nominalizing particle combination のは. Together, they are usually translated as 'the ~ known as ~ is ~', or 'the ~ called ~ is ~'. Sometimes, it can even simply be '~ means ~'. In essence, というのは is just a way to turn an entire phrase into a noun, before explaining that noun further. This explanation of (A) will either be to give a definition of it, or to give a reason for it. To use というのは , attach it to the end of a phrase that you would like to indicate as being something that will be explained further '(A)', and then follow it with your definition/reason, '(B)'. Caution Unlike というのは, which is mainly used to strongly present facts, or highlight points of discussion, replacement of は with the adverbial particle も can be used either as a rebuttal or as an extension of the original statement. This is when someone wants to show that (B) has equal weight when compared to (A). It may also be used to give the reason or cause for (A). Caution というのは is sometimes used at the beginning of a new sentence, when the speaker wants to add extra information about what has already been said. In these situations, the translation is similar to 'what I mean to say is ~', or 'because of that, ~'. Caution というのは is regularly abbreviated as とは, or って. This can be a little bit hard to identify in casual speech, but the '(B) explains (A)' concept will still almost always apply, so should be identified that way.",N3
と言うものだ',というものだ,,"Speaker's impression, Criticism or conclusion","というものだ is a fairly strong expression in Japanese that indicates that the speaker has the impression that (A) is the way it is, based on their objective judgment. This is usually translated as 'my impression of (A) is that'. However, the more literal translation is closer to '(A) is just a thing that'. This emphasizes that the speaker has high certainty that what they are saying (based on their experience) is the true nature of (A) in most cases. というものだ is constructed of という, the noun 物 'thing', and だ. It will be seen at the end of phrases that the speaker or writer is making a judgment about. As this grammar pattern is quite direct, it is often used when criticizing something. However, this is not always the case, so will need to be judged based on context. Caution In casual conversation, という may be shortened simply to って, without any change in meaning.",N2
と言うものでもない,というものでもない,,"There is no guarantee that…, Not necessarily","というものではない is an expression in Japanese that indicates that 'there is no guarantee that (A)', or that it is 'not necessarily (A)'. As this structure is just a combination of と, the う-Verb 言 う 'to say', もの 'thing', and ではない 'isn't', the literal meaning can be thought of as being similar to 'it's not a thing that one can say is (A)'. は may be replaced with も, with only a slight change in nuance. As with many grammar patterns, the version with も will be considered a bit more emphasized. というものではない may follow any word in its standard form, but may occasionally be preceded by だ when used with nouns or な-Adjectives (despite not being required). In most cases, this grammar pattern will indicate that while most of the time (A) might be something that is expected to be true, there are exceptions. Fun-fact - Although not specifically limited to it, というものではない sentences are often preceded by phrase including であれば. These sentences merely emphasize the fact that 'even if it's (A), it doesn't necessarily mean that (B)'.",N2
と言うより...,というより,,"...is more of a... than a..., Rather than saying that...","When combining the quotation use of the case marking particle と with the う - Verb 言 う 'to say', and the case marking particle より 'comparing', というより presents a phrase that is being compared through further evaluation/reconsideration. This may be thought of as similar to 'rather than saying (A), (B)' in English. というより may be used after any type of word. However, due to phrase that comes before it 'determining' something that will then be compared, nouns and な-Adjectives will require だ (despite being omitted in casual speech). だ may also be omitted if the sentence finishes with a だ that is describing the same thing in a different light. Caution It should be remembered that より (in all of its uses) will highlight something that is 'less'. This means that the (B) part of というより sentences will always describe something that is 'more', 'closer', 'more accurate', etc.",N3
と言う訳ではない,というわけではない,,"It is not that, It doesn't mean that, It is not always the case","と 言 うわけではない is often considered an emphasized version of わけではない in stating that something 'doesn't mean that (A)', '(A) is not always the case', or 'it's not that (A)'. Being that という often presents (A) as a matter for discussion, or an important quotation structure, it will regularly be used to refer back to something that another person has said, in order to clarify that it may not be 100% accurate. というわけではない may be used after any structure that could usually be paired with という, and a more literal translation may be thought of as 'it is not so that (A) can be said'. Although not required, だ will often be seen before nouns and な-Adjectives, and というわけではない. と 言 うわけではない will regularly be used when the speaker is denying that something said earlier is the reason for something. This could either be a misunderstanding that they themselves want to avoid, or something that the listener asked them to clarify. Fun Fact When used in the positive form, という 訳 だ is often attached to the end of statements that are considered to be either obvious, or clear due to context or common sense. This form will just be translated as 'so that means (A)', or 'so the reason is (A)'.",N2
と言う点から考えると,という点から考えると,,"From the standpoint of, From the perspective of, From the viewpoint of, Think in terms of, Viewed from the angle of","と 言 う 点 から 考 えると is a set phrase which indicates that something is being discussed from the 'point of view of (A)'. This may be translated as 'from the viewpoint of (A)', 'speaking in terms of (A)', or 'when viewed from the angle of (A)'. The noun 点 'point' can be thought of as directly indicating the aspect of (A) that is being focused on. Literally, the meaning is 'if considered from the aspect of (A), (B)'. This expression often follows either verbs or nouns, However, when following nouns, の may occasionally replace という, especially in cases where it is a simple noun, rather than an entire quotation that just happens to finish with a noun. Fun-fact Although a combination of the quotation particle と and the う-Verb 言 う 'to say', という is mostly written in hiragana and considered to be a set phrase which simply indicates that the contents of the phrase preceding it requires explaining in some way.",N2
と言う理由で,という理由で,,"For (that) reason; on the grounds of (that), With the reasoning, Under the pretext of, Due to","という 理由 で is a phrase that is used when giving reasons for (A). (A) may be a range of different things, from what happened, to what one's opinion is. Due to という quoting the previous statement as being the 'reason', という 理由 で puts quite a bit of emphasis on the reason itself. Because of this, the expression is quite similar to 'being that' in English. The case marking particle で will be used after 理由 to show that 'with' or 'by means of' that reason, (B). Fun Fact Almost all cases where という 理由 で will be used may be replaced by というわけで. However, the reverse is not true. The reason that わけ may be used for 理由 , but 理由 cannot always be used for わけ (especially at the beginning of sentences) is because わけ is another way of reading the kanji for 理由 . However, the more common kanji for 訳 will never be read as りゆう.",N3
と言う風に,という風に,,"As if to say, As if to suggest that, In such a way that, Things like","Like ふうに , the grammar point indicating that something is being done 'in the way of (A)', というふうに uses the same suffix of 風 'wind', 'air', to express that something is being done 'as if to say (A)', 'as if to suggest (A)', or 'in such a way that (A)'. As this construction is just a combination of という 'to say', and ふうに 'in a manner', the literal meaning of this expression is similar to 'in a way that would say that (A)'. This simply highlights the speaker's uncertainty about what the actual situation is, and that they are only commenting on appearances. というふうに may be seen directly after verbs, or after nouns expressing the way in which something is being done. The (B) portion of these phrases will then indicate exactly what is being done 'in a way as if to say (A)'. Caution Because という often quotes the entire statement before it, it will be important to remember this when figuring out exactly what というふうに is emphasizing.",N2
と言う,という,,"Called, Named, Known as, As much as","という is a combination of the case marking particle と, and the う - Verb 言 う. It is a set expression that primarily uses only hiragana. という connects two nouns, and means 'the (B) that is called (A)', or 'the (B) known as (A)'. Fun Fact という (and the verb 言 う itself) is often quite misunderstood, as the closest translation in English is 'to say'. In Japanese, 言 う actually refers to the information about something that cannot be discovered by simply 'looking at' it. For example, if you look at a man, you cannot know that his name is Bob, or that he works in an office, but you can know whether he is 'short', 'tall', etc. Due to this, という should only be used to express information that requires intimate knowledge, and not simple observations. It is possible to see (A) という (B) in sentences where (A) is describing something that seems 'obvious'. However, in these cases, the speaker is usually implying that something about (A) is not exactly as it seems, or that their opinion/knowledge differs. This particular nuance is not limited to nouns, and may be seen with almost any word type.",N3
と言う,という,,"Every single, Each and every, Emphasis, Everything that could be called","One of the uses of the extremely common という structure in Japanese is the pairing of identical nouns in order to convey the meaning of 'every single (A)'. In many cases, this expression will simply be used for emphasis, but the literal meaning is 'every (B) that could be called an (A)'. という will be used between the same noun repeating itself. Caution When this structure is seen with abstract expressions like 今日 'today', it will generally mean '(A) of all (A)'s'. This just implies that 'of anything that can be called (A), this particular one has something special about it'. What that special thing is will usually follow immediately after in the sentence.",N1
といえども,といえども,,"Even (if), Although, Even though","といえども is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the hypothetical form of 言 う, 言 え, and the conjunction particle ども, which is used in much the same way as けれども, or ても. Due to this, despite the more literal translation of 'even if one were to say (A)', it is usually translated simply as 'even if (A)', or 'although (A)'. といえども will be seen following nouns, い-Adjectives, or verbs in any of their standard form . といえども may also follow な-Adjectives, but だ will precede といえども in these cases. Despite the nuance being slightly different, といえども can be thought of as a very old-fashioned way of saying といっても. Due to といえども being old-fashioned, it is often used for emphasis and will frequently be paired with expressions like いくら, いかに, どんなに, etc. Fun Fact Although very rarely used, sometimes いえども is seen as 雖 も. In these cases the kanji 雖 , which means 'however', is simply paired with も. This creates a slight difference between 'however even (A)', and the more modern 'even if one were to say (A)'. Despite this, the meanings are used interchangeably in modern times.",N1
といえば,といえば,,"Speaking of, If it were the case that","と 言 えば, と 言 うと, and と 言 ったら are all expressions that are translated quite closely to 'speaking of (A)', or 'if it were the case that (A)'. Each of these structures has a slightly different nuance, but are largely used in the same situations. と 言 えば - More hypothetical, 'were it (A)'. と 言 うと - More concrete, 'if it's (A)'. と 言 ったら - More situational, 'when it's (A)'. These constructions are most commonly used after nouns, in response to something that has already been mentioned in the conversation (usually by someone else). The thing that has already been said is quite often the 'trigger' for someone remembering something, causing them to interject with と 言 えば. Caution Although these phrases are used in response to something that has already been mentioned, their purpose is to change the topic of the conversation somehow (or to add new information), rather than continuing along with the same subject.",N3
と言おうか,といおうか,,"How to put it, How shall I put it, How should I put it, Or perhaps, Or maybe, Call it … or","と 言 おうか is an expression that combines the case-marking particle と in its quotation use, the volitional form of the う-Verb 言 う, 言 おう ‘to say’, and the adverbial particle か used for mid-sentence questions. It may be translated as ‘how to put it’, or ‘perhaps it’s (A), or perhaps it’s (B)’. However, the more literal ‘shall I say it is (A), or shall I say it is (B)’ is also a common interpretation. This expression will be used twice, where both the (A) and the (B) phrase are being questioned by the speaker. As with many other uses of と of a quotation , the preceding word may be almost anything. と 言 おうか is interchangeable with the more common と 言 うか, but it is advisable to only use it when specific emphasis needs to be made, or for some type of dramatic effect. In many cases, it will sound unnatural in daily speech. と 言 おうか will frequently be used with fairly vague or imprecise descriptions, in order to avoid but hint at what the speaker actually wants to say. Often, this will be something negative, and will therefore be omitted.",N1
といった,といった,,"Such as, Like, So much as","といった is a fairly casual expression which indicates lists in the same way as structures like などの, or のような. Stemming from と, and the past-tense form of the う-Verb 言 う, といった is often translated as '(B) such as (A)', or '(B) like (A)'. といった will always be followed directly by a noun expressing the general group that (B) belongs to, with the literal translation being similar to '(B) that can be called (A)'. といった will appear with nouns both in (A) and (B). As can be seen in the last two examples above, constructions such as や and とか may be used if there is more than one (B) that fits in the category of (A).",N2
と言ってもいい,といってもいい,,"You could say, You might say","と 言 ってもいい is a common expression in Japanese which literally means 'even if you say (A), it is good/ok'. This is translated more naturally as 'you could say (A)', or 'you might say (A)'. As the と at the beginning of the phrase is the 'quotation' use of the と particle, と 言 ってもいい may be used after almost any statement that the speaker wants to quote. Fun Fact Most grammatical structures in Japanese that use 言 う will often appear without kanji. This is simply to make them easier to recognize as a grammar pattern, rather than a standard word in a sentence. This is also true for patterns that include 行 く, or 来 る .",N4
と言わず,といわず,,"Not only A or B but every-; A, B and every-; Not only A or B but all over;  A, B both, whether a or B","When used in succession, と 言 わず indicates that something is not limited to either (A) or (B), but applies to everything in a specific category or group. It may be translated as 'not just (A) or (B), but all', or '(A), (B) and everything else'. It is a combination of the case-marking particle と in its quotation use, the negative stem of 言 う, 言 わ, and the literary form of the classical auxiliary verb ぬ, ず. The literal translation is simply 'without saying (A), and without saying (B), (C)'. This 'without saying (A)' just means 'without limiting it to (A)'. This structure will follow both an (A) and a (B) noun before going on to explain what applies to everything. It will be important to remember that both (A) and (B) must be some part of a logical group when using this grammar structure, in order for it to sound natural. For example, the hands and the feet are part of the body, the morning and the afternoon are parts of a day, the chorus and the melody are parts of a song, etc. と 言 わず～と 言 わず is a fairly formal expression, and will rarely be used in everyday speech.",N1
と言われている,といわれている,,"It is said that, Is known as","といわれている is often translated as 'to be said that (A)', or 'it is known that (A)'. Like とされている , it is another construction that links the case marking particle と , with the passive form of another verb, to mark a commonly held/public opinion. The verb in this case being 言 う. However, unlike とされている which expresses a 'result', といわれている expresses 引用 a 'quotation'. To use といわれている , add it to the end of a phrase that you would like to express as being a common thing that is said. This particular grammar point is regularly seen both with, and without the kanji for 言 う, as the meaning will not change depending on its usage.",N4
到頭,とうとう,,"Finally, After all","とうとう is an adverb that is used to express that something 'finally' happens. In Japanese, there are a few ways to do this, but とうとう is one of the more common. Coming from the kanji 到頭 , this structure literally means 到 (to arrive at), 頭 (the head of/crux of) something. Due to this, 'finally', and 'after all' are the two most common translations of とうとう . Like many other adverbs in Japanese, とうとう is often used at the beginning of a phrase/sentence. While とうとう is written in hiragana the majority of the time, knowing the kanji will help when trying to remember the expression's nuance. That nuance is that something has 'ended', usually after some sort of long journey/effort. This adverb may be used to express either positive or negative outcomes, as it focuses more on the time required to achieve the result, rather than the result being good or bad. Caution とうとう is not used in situations where you expect something to happen/start, but there has not actually been a period of time in which some sort of effort was made to achieve a result. A good example of this is the changing of seasons. You might want to say 'finally, it's summer!', but this is not something that anyone has done anything to achieve. Rather, it came naturally. In these cases, いよいよ will be used, and has the nuance of 'finally', or 'at last' (in relation to something starting/happening).",N4
と思う,とおもう,,I think,"To express that you 'think' something in Japanese, the common expression と 思 う is regularly used. As you can probably guess, this is just a combination of the particle と , plus the う-Verb 思 う. とおもう can be used after any verb, い-Adjective , な-Adjective , or noun, but will require だ after a noun or な-Adjective . Although this structure usually requires だ after nouns and な-Adjectives , it is often omitted in casual speech. Caution If you want to express what somebody else is thinking, と 思 っている will be used. This is due to と 思 う having a sense of 'permanence', and thus not something that the speaker could know about another person. と 思 っている can also be used to express your own thoughts when they are currently happening.",N4
通り,とおり,,"In that way, Exactly, Precisely, Just as","Often, the noun とおり carries the meaning of 'in that way', or 'just like that'. In its kanji form, とおり will be written as 通 り, and literally means 'street', or 'way'. However, it is regularly used to indicate the level of 'sameness' one thing has with another. This 'sameness' meaning appears when とおり is used as a suffix . とおり (or どおり) may be used with verbs or nouns. In the case of verbs, it is common to see it being used after both the plain form, and the simple-past form. Both どおり and のとおり may be used directly after nouns. However, とおり will only be used when the case marking particle の comes between the noun and とおり . While both of these structures may be used interchangeably, どおり is more common, especially in speech. Fun Fact Constructions like 言 った 通 り and その 通 り are used very frequently, simply as a polite way to agree with what has been said by another. In these cases, it translates similarly to 'that's exactly right', or 'that's it!'.",N3
と考えられている,とかんがえられている,,"Is considered, Is thought of as","In its citation usage, the case marking particle と is often used with verbs in the passive form. Two of these regularly occurring verbs are 考 えられている 'to be considered', and 思 われている 'to be thought'. This grammar point is used after a phrase, and translates as 'it is considered that (A)', or 'it is thought that (A)'. It is generally used to highlight a commonly held opinion that most people agree on (not your personal opinion). The primary reason that these constructions are used in their displacement ( passive ) form, is to show that the thought itself is not something that is related to the speaker's own opinions. However, people will often use this form as a way to strengthen their own opinions, in a similar way to how English speakers would say 'everyone knows that (A)'.",N4
とか,とか～とか,,"Among other things, For example, Such as","とか is a word that belongs to a unique family of particles in Japanese called listing particles . As the name suggests, these particles are used for listing groups of items that share similarities. とか can be used after verbs, or nouns, to express 'among other things, (A)'. When multiple things are listed, the last item in the list can (and often does) have とか omitted. Caution とか is used to list items in a non-exhaustive way. What this means is that the listener will assume that there are other items in the list, apart from what is stated directly. The speaker is just providing a few examples of a (potentially much larger) category. Fun Fact As we have seen, とか may be used with verb phrases. This is in contrast to や , a similar grammar point that can only be used for listing nouns.",N4
とか,とか,,"I heard that… something like, They said ... or something","Being a combination of the particles と and か, とか 'quotes' the previous statement as being something that has been heard, but is unconfirmed or uncertain. In English, this translates as 'I heard something like (A)', or '(A) or something was said'. とか may appear after verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns. This meaning of 'or something' when using とか is fairly casual and will often be heard in everyday conversation. Caution This combination of と and か may appear the same as the とか used to indicate lists, but the former is simply a combination of the case-marking particle と, and the adverbial particle か, while the latter is a single listing particle . Despite this, both structures are originally combinations of と and か, and may be thought to have some overlap in meaning.",N2
と聞いた,ときいた,,I heard that,"When the particle と is used for citation in Japanese, it is regularly partnered with other verbs, to form set phrases. One of these set expressions is と 聞 いた , which means 'I heard that (A)'. と 聞 いた may be used after any phrase expressing the thing that was heard. Caution だ is often omitted after nouns and な-Adjectives when used with ときいた in casual conversation. While this sounds perfectly normal, it is technically not correct Japanese.",N4
と来たら,ときたら,,"When it comes to, That or this … of mine, That or this darn …, That or this blasted …","ときたら is an expression used casually when expressing mild frustration toward (A) in a lighthearted manner. This structure is a combination of the case-marking particle と, and 来 る combined with the conjunction particle たら 'if', 来 たら. It will often simply be translated as 'that blasted (A)', or 'that damn (A)'. Despite this, the literal meaning is just 'when it comes to (A)'. ときたら will directly follow nouns. This grammar pattern will almost exclusively appear in kana, so memorizing the stem verb it comes from will help to remember the meaning. Fun Fact In line with the literal meaning of 'when it comes to (A)', ときたら may also be used when the speaker wants to highlight something about (A) that is 'to be expected', or 'only natural'. Determining whether ときたら is being used in this way, or to express frustration, is usually quite clear in the second half of the statement. Despite having two almost opposite nuances, it may help to think of ときたら as just 'when it comes to (A)' in all situations, with the (B) part of the phrase indicating whether it is positive or negative.",N1
と来たら,と来（き）たら,,"For …(is the best), When it comes to, Concerning","When used in the more literal sense, ときたら is a grammar pattern that means ‘when it comes to (A)’, or ‘concerning (A)’. It is a combination of the case-marking particle と, and 来 る combined with the conjunction particle たら ‘if’, 来 たら. This is not to be confused with the alternative translation of ときたら which is ‘that damned (A)’ when used for criticism. ときたら will attach to the end of a phrase marking what the conversation is ‘concerning’, before that topic will then be explained further. In other words, (A) will present the topic, while (B) will indicate the speaker’s first instinctive thoughts about that topic. For the speaker, (A) is usually something that strongly makes them think of (B). However, it may just be that the relationship between (A) and (B) is a thing that the speaker is implying as obvious, or that goes without saying. Due to this, the (B) phrase often begins with やっぱり or やはり ‘sure enough’.",N1
時,とき,,"When, At the time of","とき , or 時 in kanji, is a noun that is regularly used to signify 'when' something happened (a verb). However, unlike some other time expressions, とき is mainly used to express things that happen at regular intervals (habits, hobbies, etc.), or at broad times/individual events (when it rains, when there is a sale at the shop, etc.) Using とき is quite easy! You just need to attach it to the end of any independent word (verbs, nouns, or adjectives). As with most cases where a noun will be attached to another word in Japanese, we will also be required to use な after な-Adjectives , and の after nouns. The case-marking particle に will generally come directly after 時 , signifying that another verb is about to follow. Caution As discussed previously, ときに is primarily used to discuss when things happened. What this means is that it will not be used to highlight ongoing states that were true during the first action. For example 'the time you tripped over a log on Tuesday'. When とき is used, the nuance will be that it is describing one thing leading to another, rather than a static thing.",N4
ところが,ところが,,"Even so, However, Even though, But","ところが is a conjunction in Japanese that is a combination of the noun, ところ 'place', and the conjunction particle が. It is used to highlight that (A) was expected, but the unexpected result (B) occurred. It is usually translated as 'however', or 'despite that'. ところが is most often used at the beginning of a new sentence, before highlighting something that is contrary to what was described in the previous sentence. This use of が in Japanese is referred to as 確定 の 逆接 , which basically means 'a contradictory conclusion'. Caution Because ところが highlights a result that is unexpected, it can only be used for things that are beyond the control of the speaker. However, if the speaker is trying to do something, but assumes that their attempt may result in failure, ところが can be used to show that they were unexpectedly successful. Fun Fact Sometimes, ところが is referred to as a conjunction particle itself, disregarding the combination of ところ and が. This is similar to ところで, another conjunction particle that has a slightly different meaning, and is frequently translated as 'by the way'.",N3
ところだった,ところだった,,"Almost, Nearly, About to, On the verge of","As explained in the ところ grammar point, ところ is a noun that is often used to highlight the situation within which a verb is 'about to' happen (when that verb appears in its non-past form). However when followed by だった , it emphasizes that the thing that was 'about to' happen never actually eventuated (or that another more important event happened at that moment). This can be translated as 'to almost (A)', or 'to be on the verge of (A)'. The verb that ところ is paired with may also be seen grouped with the auxiliary verb ない. In this case, it implies that something was 'about not' to happen (but then did).",N3
ところだった,ところだった,,"Was just about to do something, Was in the middle of...","When combined with the dictionary form of verbs, ところだった will indicate that something was about to happen, and will regularly be translated as 'was just about to do (A)', or 'was in the middle of (A)'. In many cases, ところだった will indicate either a positive or negative result that came about from 'not doing (A)'. As this grammar pattern is a combination of ところ 'place', and the past tense of だ, だった; it will put emphasis of 'having been in the place or situation of (A)', before something happened that caused the expected result to change. In cases where a positive result was narrowly missed out on, のに will often appear directly after ところだった. This can be interpreted as 'despite almost doing (A), (B)'.",N2
ところで,ところで,,"By the way, Incidentally","ところで is a conjunction particle that is made up of the noun, ところ 'place', and the case marking particle で. It is used in a similar way to 'by the way', or 'incidentally' in English, but will only be used for introducing new topics, not continuing within the same topic. ところで will primarily appear at the beginning of a sentence, before making a statement or asking a question about something unrelated. The literal translation of ところで is closer to 'and with that', and implies that something (within the previous topic) suddenly reminded the speaker of another thing (that happens to be a new topic). Caution When ところで appears after the past tense of a verb as たところで, it carries a different meaning, and will express that something isn't the case, despite (A). This is an advanced grammar point that will be covered at another stage.",N3
ところを見ると,ところを見ると,,"Judging from, Seeing that","ところを 見 ると is a set phrase in Japanese that highlights the situation or place of (A), before examining it subjectively. This often comes across simply as 'judging from (A)', or 'seeing that (A)'. Literally, it can be thought of as 'if looking at the aspect of (A)', before the speaker will then go on to state what their judgment is. This grammar pattern will appear directly following verbs in any of their standard forms. Due to ところを 見 ると expressing primarily subjective opinions based on single observable actions, the (B) part of sentences including this structure will often include things like だろう, かも, でしょう, ね, etc, in order to show that the speaker is not actually claiming anything factually.",N2
ところを,ところを,,"When, While, In spite of (the circumstances), Regardless of (the circumstances)","Being a combination of the noun ところ 'place' or 'situation', and the adverbial particle を, ところを is a grammar construction that will be used in order to express 2 primary meanings. The first is 'in spite of (A)', or 'regardless of (A)'. This nuance of ところ will be that the speaker is politely acknowledging the situation that someone else is in, and apologizing for interrupting them in that moment. ところを may come after any structure that could pair with a noun. This means verbs in their standard forms , い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives followed by な, or nouns followed by の. The second meaning that ところを is often used for will simply be 'when (A)', or 'at the time of (A)', with a focus on being a situation in which the action of (A) is interrupted by (B). This may have either a positive or negative nuance. This use of ところを will appear exclusively after verbs in any of their standard forms . The を itself may be omitted when used to express either of these meanings. Fun Fact ところを is occasionally split into two different grammar points depending on the source. However, it is important to remember that the underlying meaning of both of these is the same. ところ marks the place or situation, while を marks how that situation is being utilized either positively or negatively. When it comes to apologizing, the speaker themselves is the one 'using' that moment with を, and is therefore acknowledging that.",N1
とされている,とされている,,"To be considered, To be deemed, Be regarded as, Be accepted as, To be said, To be accredited with","とされている is an expression that is commonly translated as 'to be considered as (A)', or 'to be regarded as (A)'. Conceptually, it is similar to にする , which means 'to decide on (A)'. However, due to する being in the passive form in this construction, it is closer to 'to be decided on', and expresses the general opinions/thoughts of large groups of people. The と in this expression is a case marking particle , and expresses the result nuance of this particle. Caution The main difference between と as a case marking particle and と as a conjunction particle is that the case-marking particle will always link a single word/phrase to one specific word/result. The conjunction particle on the other hand, will often be followed by a 読点 (Japanese comma), as it is separating two distinct thoughts within the sentence, rather than just a simple 'result'.",N4
とすると,としたら・とすれば・とすると,,"If it were the case that, Assuming that...","When partnered with several of the assumption based expressions that are used in Japanese, the case marking particle と may be used to show a hypothesis about a certain result. This is one of the result highlighting uses of と. Structures that may be seen are as follows: (A) としたら (B) - When (A) is the result, (B). (A) とすれば (B) - If the result is (A), (B). (A) とすると (B) - A result of (A) will be (B). Although these nuances are slightly different, realistically they are used in almost exactly the same way, to express a possible (undetermined) result. This can be translated to 'assuming that (A)', or 'if it were the case that (A)'. To use these expressions, simply attach と and your chosen variation of したら to the end of any verb/ い-Adjective , or noun/ な-Adjective followed by だ .",N3
としては,としては,,"As a, For a, As for","Like として , a grammar point meaning 'as', としては functions as an extension of this, with the は particle merely emphasizing the (A) subject as a stand-alone entity that is about to be compared with something, or that the speaker is assuming the result of (B), from the standpoint of (A). としては may be translated as 'as (A)', or 'for an (A)'. (A) will frequently highlight a person or organization in cases where the speaker is making an assumption from that standpoint. This structure will be used after nouns, and is a combination of と, the て-form of する, and は. The literal translation is something similar to 'going off that (A) is (A), (B)'. In cases where the noun connected to としては is not a person or organization, the translation will often simply be 'as for'. In these sentences, としては is merely highlighting the broad topic of (A), before the speaker offers their thoughts about what applies to that topic. In contrast to にしては , としては is more frequently used to make broad judgements taking into consideration all aspects of (A), and what would usually be expected of (A), rather than for giving personal opinions.",N2
としても,としても,,"Even if (we assume), Assuming,  Also as","としても is a structure used in Japanese for expressing thoughts about (A), assuming that it were what is being described. This may be translated as 'even if we assume that it's (A)', or 'assuming that (A)'. However, the literal translation is quite close to 'even going off that it were (A), (B)', as としても simply expresses that despite (A) not being true, the speaker is willing to say that it is for arguments sake, before giving their thoughts about that hypothetical situation. としても will be seen following verbs and い-Adjectives, or nouns and な-Adjectives that are followed by だ. In some cases, としても just functions as an extension of として 'as', and can be interpreted as 'even as (A)'. This nuance primarily highlights people or organizations in the position of (A), and states that 'even for (A), it will still be (B)'. Unlike the previous nuance, this としても will only be used with nouns.",N2
として,として,,"As (i.e. in the role of), For","When the case marking particle と is used to highlight a result , it regularly translates to 'as' in English. This nuance of 'as' simply assumes that (A) is a plain or unchanging fact from which something (usually an opinion or evaluation) is based. Combining this nuance of と with して (the conjugation form of する ), として will present (A) as the base point from which (B) can be determined. Despite being a combination of several individual parts, として is often considered to be a 副助詞 (adverbial particle) by itself, meaning that it will most often be seen connected directly to nouns. As として works in the same way as a 副助詞 , it may be connected directly to a second noun to express that (B) is something functioning as (A). Fun Fact This result use of と regularly appears when one particular aspect of something is being highlighted (while other aspects still exist). This simply means that nothing apart from (A) is being considered when expressing (B).",N3
疾っくに,とっくに,,"Already, A long time ago, Long ago","疾 っくに , seen primarily as とっくに , is an adverb that can be translated roughly as 'long ago'. This word is an emphasized version of 疾 うに, a literary form which is not used much in modern Japanese. とっくに is a sentence altering adverb, so will appear most often at the beginning of sentences, or before the verb it is describing as having happened a long time ago. When compared with structures like すでに and もう , とっくに will either indicate something that has happened much further in the past, or may be used simply for exaggeration. Fun-fact It is uncommon to see とっくに listed with an exact time, as the stem (old Japanese) word 疾 し already means something close to 'far earlier', or 'at a much earlier time'.",N2
とても～ない,とても～ない,,"Not ~ at all, Cannot ~ at all","When seen in sentences containing verbs negated with the auxiliary verb ない, とても carries the nuance of 'not (A) at all', or 'cannot (A) at all'. とても is supposed to only be used when expressing 'impossibility', 不可能 . Due to this, it will primarily appear alongside the potential form of verbs. Fun Fact As long as some part of the sentence expresses the speaker's view about the impossibility of (A), the verb is not always required to be in the negative form.",N3
との,との,,"That, To","との is a compound particle made up of the case-marking particle と in its quotation use, and the case-marking particle の. Effectively, this marks the previous statement as a quote, before の then indicates that the whole statement is an attribute of the following word. In many cases, this will simply be translated as ‘that’, or ‘to’. As always with the quotation use of と, it will appear after almost any word, and may or may not be separated from nouns and な-Adjectives with だ. This expression indicates that the preceding information is information of some type, and will therefore usually be followed by a noun that highlights what type of communication it was. Common examples include 提案 ‘proposal’, 知 らせ　’notice’, 意向 ‘inclination’, 依頼 ‘request’, 見方 ‘point of view’, 指摘 ‘pointing out’, 報告 ‘report’, etc.",N1
とは言え,とはいえ,,"Though, Although (I admit that), Be that as it may, Nonetheless","とは 言 え is one of the standard grammar patterns in Japanese that makes use of the imperative form in order to strongly state a point. It will often be translated as 'although (A), (B) will not change', or 'be that as it may, (B)'. Literally, it is just making use of the case-marking particle と in addition to the adverbial particle は to present (A) as a quote that the speaker acknowledges, but may not actually accept. As this structure begins with と, it may be used at the end of any standard statement. In most situations, the way that とはいえ will be used is like the English 'say that it is (A), that still doesn't change (B)'. (A) will generally be something that is true, or true as far as the speaker knows.",N1
とは比べものにならない,とは比べものにならない,,"Nothing compared to, Cannot be compared to, Much more, Way better, Above comparison (beyond comparison), Far greater than","In order to emphasize that something is far beyond what could possibly be compared to (A), the emphatic phrase とは 比 べものにならない will be used. This is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the adverbial particle は, the neologism 比 べもの 'a comparable thing', the case-marking particle に, and the negated form of the う-Verb なる 'to become', ならない. This may seem like a lot, but it is just expressing that '(A) will not be a comparable thing'. This structure will be used before nouns, where that noun is the thing that cannot be compared. This is usually due to quality, quantity, or some other feature that is easily measurable. As this grammar pattern is emphatic, it will indicate that the difference between (A) and (B) is quite large, without specifically expressing the amount. Additionally, like in the final example, we can sometimes see the use of the adverbial particle は a second time before ならない. This just adds further emphasis or highlights contrast. Fun Fact As a reminder, a neologism is just a set word or phrase which has come to be used a certain way due to habits or customs. 比 べもの itself is just a mix of the conjunctive form of the る-Verb 比 べる 'to compare', and the noun もの 'thing'.",N1
とは言うものの,とは言うものの,,"Although, But, Although I say, Although it is said, Having said that","とは 言 うものの is a set expression that may be used after most types of words, it is a combination of と as a case-marking particle, は as an adverbial particle , the う-Verb 言 う, and the conjunction particle ものの 'although'. Its literal translation of 'although it is said that (A), (B)' is the same as how it will usually be interpreted in English. When used after either nouns or な-Adjectives, だ will precede とは 言 うものの . This phrase may also be used at the beginning of sentences when acknowledging a statement that was made, but then pointing out that there is other important information as well. In all cases, the (B) phrase that comes after ものの will be considered the important or defining detail.",N1
とは限らない,とは限らない,,"Not necessarily so, Is not always true, There is no guarantee that","とは 限 らない is regularly used to convey the meaning of '(A) is not necessarily so', or 'there is no guarantee that (A)'. This expression utilizes the case marking particle と in its use for highlighting results , the adverbial particle は, and the negated form of the う - Verb 限 る 'to limit'. This structure may be used with verbs, い-Adjectives , な-Adjectives , or nouns. However, だ will be required after な-Adjectives and nouns. 限 らない literally means 'to not be bound', or 'to not be limited'. Therefore, despite と highlighting a result, that result is then being clarified as 'not the only possibility'.",N3
とは...,とは,,"That..., (Surprised) that..., (Never expected) that..., (Shocked) that...","とは is an emphatic structure that is regularly seen at the end of sentences, and will imply that the statement before it is shocking, appalling, or unexpected. In English, it translates very similarly as 'to think that (A)' in that it expresses a strong emotional response without expressly saying what that exact response is. とは is a combination of the case-marking particle と in its quotation use, and the adverbial particle は. In this way, it is just marking the whole statement of (A) as what is being highlighted as the topic, without actually stating anything else about it. とは may sometimes be seen following など or similar structures, and in these cases will just imply that 'something like (A)' is what is shocking. Caution Although it is common for とは to come at the end of a sentence with the actual feeling word omitted, the speaker may expressly state their reaction afterwards.",N1
とばかりに,とばかり（に）,,"As if (to say), Seeming that","とばかり is a construction that is often used to show that something is being done 'as if to say (A)', or 'seeming that (A)'. It is a combination of the case-marking particle と in its ' quotation ' use, and the adverbial particle ばかり, exhibiting that something is 'basically exactly as described'. Due to this, とばかり simply indicates that while (A) is as described, it is not literally the case. とばかり can appear after almost any word, as the と is creating a quote. に will often follow ばかり when the sentence is going on to describe what is actually happening. とばかりに is an abbreviation of と 言 わんばかり 'to only just not be at the point where (A) is said', which itself will still be seen quite often. In this case, 言 わん is an abbreviation of 言 わぬ, making use of the classical auxiliary verb ぬ used for negation. Caution As とばかりに will be used to describe the way that something 'looks like it is about to say', it won't be used for describing the speaker themselves. However, it may occasionally be seen being used about the speaker if the sentence is in third person.",N1
と見える,とみえる,,"It seems that, It can be deduced, One can conclude that","とみえる (primarily written only in hiragana) is a phrase that combines the case marking particle と , with the る-Verb 見 える 'to appear', or 'to be visible'. This use of the と particle in Japanese is called a result , and marks when (A) is something that has come to a conclusion, or can be concluded. In this way とみえる literally means 'from the way it appears, one can conclude that it's (A)'. However, this translates a bit more smoothly as 'it can be deduced that (A)', or 'it seems that (A)'. This expression is always used directly after the phrase that it is drawing as a conclusion. However, nouns and な-Adjectives will require だ before とみえる . While this phrase is conjecture (making a guess about something), it usually implies that the speaker has done some sort of research, or has some reason that led them to 'draw (A) as a conclusion'. Due to this, it appears reasonably confident. Fun Fact と always 'sums up' things. As a quotation , it sums up the phrase before it as either something that was said, or thought. As 一緒 'being together', it sums up groups of things that are existing/performing actions mutually. Lastly, as a result , it sums up causes, and then illustrates their effects.",N4
ともあろう,ともあろう,,"Of all people, Such,","ともあろう is a grammatical structure in Japanese which highlights either the skill or responsibility that a particular person or organization has, and what they are doing despite that, or that contradicts that. It will be interpreted as ‘(A) of all people’, or ‘such as (A)’. Often, ともあろう will be followed by the speaker's opinion about how (A) is being ignorant of what is expected of them. This construction is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the adverbial particle も, and the volitional form of the う-Verb ある, あろう ‘to be’. The literal meaning is ‘even a (B) such as (A), (C)’, with (C) being something unexpected or unwanted. ともあろう will be seen after nouns, and may be followed by the conjunction particle が ‘but’, or a combination of the noun もの and が for further emphasis. もの is primarily used for emphasis, and other words such as 方 ‘individual’, or 人 ‘person’ may also be used. Caution Occasionally, this grammar pattern may be used sarcastically towards someone of the same position or lower. The context of the sentence is the only thing  that would clarify whether it is criticism or sarcasm.",N1
とも無く,ともなく・ともなしに,,"Absentmindedly, Mindlessly, Unconsciously, Without paying attention","ともなく and ともなしに are structures used to indicate that (A) was being done absentmindedly when (B) happened. It will be translated as 'unconsciously (A) when (B)', or 'without paying attention to (A), (B)'. This pattern is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the adverbial particle も, and the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective ない. It will be seen after the dictionary form of verbs, and can be thought of as literally meaning something similar to 'even while not intending to (B), while (A), (B)'. ともなしに is similar, but pairs the noun なし 'without' with に, instead of using the conjugative form of ない. ともなく and ともなしに will often be seen in sentences that use たら. This puts emphasis on the specific time that something happened while performing another action absentmindedly. Despite translating this way, the action that precedes ともなく itself will be intentional, but the thing that comes about as a result of performing that action will not be what the doer was aiming to achieve.",N1
となると,ともなると・にもなると,,"When, If, Once, As","となると is a strong expression in Japanese that focuses on highlighting that once some relatively high threshold is reached, (B) will occur. While となると may be seen in several different forms, the base structure is a combination of the particle と, the う-Verb なる 'to become', and the particle と repeated in its use of highlighting a certain outcome. Standard translations are 'once (A), (B)', and 'when (A), (B)'. A more literal translation can be thought of as 'once (A) happens, it is sure to follow that (B)'. The other forms that となると may be seen in are ともなると , となれば , and ともなれば . The primary difference being that も adds slight emphasis. While ば and と do have slightly different nuances by default, in terms of this specific grammar point, they are used completely interchangeably. となると may be seen following nouns, or verbs in any of their standard form . も may also be used following the subject of ともなると sentences, and simply places emphasis on that subject. Fun Fact The emphasis that is seen in this grammar pattern is partly due to the function of the first と, and is one of the reasons that になると will not be used to convey a similar meaning. に and と are regularly used in this way in Japanese, with と almost always indicating that the outcome of something is unavoidable, cannot be controlled, is as to be expected. に merely focuses on the transition from (A) to (B).",N1
とも,とも,,"Even if, No matter","とも is a particle that can be used either as a sentence-ending particle, conjunction particle, or adverbial particle. Despite this, the meanings are often interchangeable, and it depends mostly on what type of word they are grouped with as to which type of particle it is. Common interpretations of とも in almost any situation are 'even if (A)', or 'no matter if (A)', and it will basically always simply highlight that 'in spite of (A), still (B)'. As a conjunction particle, とも will be paired with any words that are followed by the auxiliary verbs う, or よう, or after い-Adjectives in their conjunctive form. The adverbial particle usage only appears after い-Adjectives in their conjunctive form, and a select number of adverbs. It is recommended not to use this structure after adverbs unless you have already seen it used this way in native material.",N2
と並んで,と並んで,,"In line with, Comparable with, Along with, Just like, As … as","Often, when the case marking particle と is used alongside the conjunction particle て containing form of the う - Verb 並 ぶ 'to line up', the meaning of 'to be comparable with (A)', or 'to be in line with (A)' will be conveyed. と 並 んで will be preceded by nouns, or noun phrases. Occasionally, the plain form of 並 ぶ can be seen alongiside ほど , to show that (B) is 'at the extent of being in line with (A)'.",N3
と共に,と共に,,"Together with, At the same time,  As well as","共 is a noun in Japanese that is frequently used as a either a prefix , or a suffix . In the case of と 共 に , it is used in conjunction with the case marking particle と as an adverb. と 共 に expresses that (A) will happen 'together with (B)', or 'at the same time as (B)'. と 共 に may be used after verbs, い-Adjectives , な-Adjectives or nouns. With な-Adjectives , it will sometimes be preceded by である . Fun Fact と 共 に is a structure that is used when two things are 'existing' in the same way. This means that it may be used to show mutual actions, or that it may be used to show mutual qualities (states of existence). Because of this nuance 'to be mutually (A)' is one of the closest literal translations of と 共 に . (A) may be an action, an adjective, or even a noun!",N3
と同じくらい,と同じくらい,,"About the same as, About as, No less","As a combination of the case marking particle と, the noun 同 じ 'the same', and the adverbial particle くらい. と 同 じくらい is an expression used to highlight that something is 'about the same as (A)'. To use と 同 じくらい, attach it to the end of a noun that you want to highlight as being the prime example, with whatever is comparable to it coming later in the sentence, or directly attached through the case marking particle の. If you want to express that an action is being performed in 'almost the same way' as (A), に may replace の, after くらい.",N3
とおなじで,と同じで・と違って,,"Like, Similar to, Unlike, Dissimilar to","Two regular expressions that are used in Japanese for conveying similarity, and dissimilarity are と 同 じで 'the same as (A)', and と 違 って 'different to (A)'. While both of these structures use the case marking particle と to mark (A), 同 じ is a noun, while 違 って is the て form of the う - Verb, 違 う. Due to this, the auxiliary verb だ is required after 同 じ, in order to link (A) and (B). だ will appear in its conjunctive form . Both と 同 じで and と 違 って will be preceded by a noun or noun phrase, before the (B) part of the sentence will describe the similarity/dissimilarity. In this structure, as the conjunction particle て, has a similar role to the conjunctive form of だ (で), both expressions are simply stating that (B) is existing in a state of 'having sameness', or 'having difference' with (A).",N3
とちがって,と同じで・と違って,,"Like, Similar to, Unlike, Dissimilar to","Two regular expressions that are used in Japanese for conveying similarity, and dissimilarity are と 同 じで 'the same as (A)', and と 違 って 'different to (A)'. While both of these structures use the case marking particle と to mark (A), 同 じ is a noun, while 違 って is the て form of the う - Verb, 違 う. Due to this, the auxiliary verb だ is required after 同 じ, in order to link (A) and (B). だ will appear in its conjunctive form . Both と 同 じで and と 違 って will be preceded by a noun or noun phrase, before the (B) part of the sentence will describe the similarity/dissimilarity. In this structure, as the conjunction particle て, has a similar role to the conjunctive form of だ (で), both expressions are simply stating that (B) is existing in a state of 'having sameness', or 'having difference' with (A).",N3
と同時に,と同時に,,"At the same time as, The instant, The moment, As well as","To convey that things are happening at the same time in Japanese, と 同時 に will often be used. This is a combination of the case marking particle と in its listing particle use, 同時 , a noun meaning 'the same time', and に, the case marking particle marking a location. と 同時 に translates as 'at the same time as (A)', 'the instant that (A)', or 'as well as (A)'. In sentences that use this grammar structure, (A) is considered to be the primary event, but any (B) or (C) events are not considered any less important. In the case of nouns and な-Adjectives , である is often omitted. While the literal meaning of と 同時 に is 'at the same time', this expression is also regularly used when listing multiple roles or functions that someone/thing has. This comes across as 'as well as', but still carries the 'at the same time nuance'.",N3
と思いきや...,と思いきや,,"Thought...but, When...thought that...but, Despite having thought...","と 思 いきや is an expression used in Japanese for indicating that something is not as one had thought, and will often be translated as 'despite having thought (A), (B)', or 'when I thought that (A), it was actually (B)'. と 思 いきや is a combination of the case marking particle と, the conjunctive form of the う-Verb 思 う, 思 い, the classical auxiliary verb き, which indicates past tense, and the classical binding (adverbial) particle や, which marks actual or rhetorical questions in the same way as か. Due to this, a more literal translation is 'I thought it had (A), but I guess (B)'. Despite the origin of the phrase, in modern Japanese と 思 いきや is just thought of as an emphatic structure that highlights the speaker's surprise in relation to something not being as they had expected. と 思 いきや may follow any word in its standard form . The particle か may appear before と 思 いきや , but this just further emphasizes the same rhetorical question, as や itself has the same role. Caution A past tense phrase will always appear in (B), as it is considered to be the actual situation which has come about, or has been realized by the speaker.",N1
と考えられる,と考えられる,,"Can be considered as, Is thought to be, One can think that, It is conceivable that","In order to express an objective opinion in Japanese, the expression と 考 えられる will often be used. This is a combination of と, and the passive-indicating auxiliary verb られる. Common translations for this structure include 'can be considered as (A)', 'is thought to be (A)', or 'it is conceivable that (A)'. As と 考 えられる begins with と, this structure will frequently appear at the end of entire phrases, converting them into a quote. When wanting to express a subjective opinion, と 思 われる will be used instead. Fun-fact The primary difference between a subjective and objective opinion is that an objective opinion is primarily based on observable facts about the topic (unbiased and focuses on the object), while a subjective opinion is based more on emotions, feelings, or preferences (may be biased, regardless of what is actually true about the topic). Caution Compared to と 考 えられている , と 考 えられる focuses more on judgements, while the former is primarily used to illustrate widely accepted opinions.",N2
と言える,と言える,,"Would or could say that..., Can probably say that..., Fair to say that...","と 言 える is a common expression that utilizes the potential form of the verb 言 う 'to say', to highlight that it is possible for something to be said. This phrase is often used to express a general idea about something that the speaker believes to be correct. と 言 える translates as 'it is fair to say (A)', or 'one could say (A)'. As the case marking particle と is being used in its 引用 (citation) use, と 言 える may follow any direct phrase/statement. と 言 える is regularly seen paired with grammar patterns like だろう , or でしょう . This makes the overall statement more friendly, by considering the listener's thoughts about the issue being presented. と 言 えるだろう can simply be translated as 'can we not say (A)?', or '(A) can be said, right?'. Caution When the potential form of 言 う is linked with the auxiliary verb よう, it creates a much stronger phrase that is similar to 'let it be said that (A)'. Fun Fact The speaker is usually relatively confident about their statement when using と 言 える, but the usage of a form that expresses conjecture shows that they are open to the possibility of being wrong, thus softening the tone.",N3
と言っても,～と言っても,,Although ~ might say that ~,"As a construction that combines と 言 う (presenting the previous statement as a quotation) and ても, meaning 'even if (A)', or 'even though (A)', と 言 っても will mean 'even if I say (A)', or 'although I say (A)'. This expression is used when the speaker wants to highlight (A), but draw the listener's attention to (B), in order to clarify something. This expression may be used after any word in almost any tense, due to the case marking particle と is being used in its quotation role. However, な-Adjectives and nouns will sometimes be followed by だ (although it is regularly omitted). Fun Fact 言 う is a う - Verb that focuses on what can be said about something, rather than specifically what one person is saying. Due to this, if no speaker is identified with が, then と 言 っても could mean 'although some might say (A)', or 'even though it is said that (A)'.",N3
と～と、どちらが,と～と、どちらが,,Between ~ which one,"と～と、どちらが is an expression in Japanese that is made from the following parts: と - The particle (x2) in its meaning of 'and'. どちら - The polite speech form of 誰 'who', and a slightly newer form of どっち that basically means 'which'. が - The case marking particle . This structure is used when the speaker is asking a question about whether someone will choose (A) or (B). It is only used when there are no more than two possible choices. As can be seen above, verbs may be used as part of this structure if they are nominalized with こと , or の . Additionally, the polite form does not specifically need to be used, and どっち may be used instead. The second と itself is quite often omitted, as どちら (or どっち) implies that both (A) and (B) are part of the same structure. Fun Fact As どちら is the polite speech form of 誰 , it is also frequently used as a polite way to ask questions about unknown people. Caution どちらのほう (or どっちのほう) may also be used, but this does not really change the overall nuance. It merely puts slightly more emphasis on the 'direction' of the choice. This is similar to expressions like 'which one are you leaning towards?' in English.",N4
と,と,prt,And,"と is a particle that is often thought of as meaning 'and' in English, which is usually how it can be translated. In a broader sense, と simply shows that there is a relationship of 'compilation' between (A) and (B). That relationship could be existing together (translated as ' and '), or performing an action together (translated as ' with '). In this case, we will focus on the 'and' translation. A full description of と as 'with' can be found here . と is required after every noun that it is grouped with. However, the last と in a sentence will often be omitted, if there are several. In this example, we can see that the last noun in the group (pencil) does not require the particle と , although it is considered more correct to have it. In conversation, the last と will almost always be omitted.",N5
と,と,,"If, When, Whenever, And, [Conditional]","In the same way as the case marking particle と means 'and', sometimes it is translated as 'if'. In these cases, it is considered to be far stronger than ば , なら , or たら (which express hypothetical outcomes). This is because one of the primary uses of と is highlighting a result . In these cases, と is actually a conjunction particle , and shows one of three things. 仮定 の 順接 - A result that is assumed to be true, and obvious. 確定 の 順接 - A result that is known to be true. 仮定 の 逆接 - The opposite of a result that is assumed to be true. Due to this, the (B) part of a phrase using と as 'if', will always occur when (A) happens, as it is considered to be the result of (A). と may not be used in situations where the (B) result 'might' happen. It must be definite (or close to definite). In this particular nuance of と , despite being translated as 'if', the actual meaning is much closer to 'and', as と is expressing that (A) and (B) will always go together.",N4
と,と,prt,With,"In our second lesson about と , we will look at the common translation of 'with' that is associated with this particle. と shows that there is a relationship between (A) and (B), regardless of if that relationship is translated as ' and ', or ' with '. In either case, the nouns that are marked with と are usually all performing some mutual action (that mutual action may simply be existing). When と is used as 'with', it means that both/all people or objects are equally involved in the action. However, に highlights that one person is the target (destination) of an action, so will result in something sounding a lot more one sided. Here we can see that both people are talking when と is used. It is a mutual conversation. When に is used, however, the person marked by に is being talked 'to', and is usually not actively participating in the conversation.",N5
と,と,prt,Quotation,"One of the regular functions of と in Japanese is as a quotation particle. This use is called 引用 in Japanese, which basically translates as 'reference', or 'citation'. This way of using と can appear after almost any type of word (or phrase), but requires だ when used after nouns or な-Adjectives . と as a quotation marker will almost always be followed by a verb that shows what type of 'quote' it is. This can be words like 言 う, 思 う, 考 える, 聞 く, etc. However, at the end of a sentence, the verb will often be omitted. As with other instances of the particle と being used, this use simply expresses the relationship between (A) 'what was communicated', and (B) 'how it was communicated'.",N5
どうしても,どうしても,,"Regardless of, No matter what","どうしても is a construction in Japanese that is often considered to be a stand-alone adverb meaning 'no matter how', or 'regardless of anything'. Originally, it is a combination of the adverb どう 'how', and the ても form of する , しても 'even doing'. どうしても will regularly be used at the beginning of sentences before conveying something that is considered by the speaker to be 'absolutely true'. Alternatively, どうしても may be used after verbs, following the case marking particle と. This will express that 'if (A) happens, (B) is unavoidable'. Fun Fact As the closest literal meaning of どう in English is 'any', どうしても also translates quite accurately as 'in any case'.",N3
どうせ,どうせ,,"Anyhow, At any rate, In any case, I have no doubt that, Probably","どうせ is an adverb used in Japanese to express that some particular state or condition of (A) will result in (B). Usually, there is no way to stop (B) from happening, and it is considered a natural consequence of (A). In English, this translates closely with phrases like 'at any rate', or 'in any case'. Being an adverb, どうせ most often appears at the beginning of sentences, before going on to describe the inevitable situation. どうせ often carries the nuance of frustration or resignation that (A) cannot be changed. In these cases, it is often paired with other grammar structures such as なら or だから. This shows that if (A) cannot be changed, then (B) is a good idea. This usage translates similarly to 'if (A), you might as well (B)'. Fun-fact This grammar structure comes from a combination of どう 'how', and the imperative form of する, せよ. In this way, it is just emphasizing that no matter 'how (A) is done', the result cannot be changed.",N2
どうにも,どうにも,,"Cannot, There is no way one can, Nothing one can do, Cannot possibly not by any means, Cannot do no matter how hard one tries, Nothing will come out, It is meaningless to","どうにも is an expression that is often paired with negative structures such as できない 'cannot', ならない 'won't happen', or ようがない 'no way'. It is a combination of the adverb どう 'how', the case marking particle に, and the adverbial particle も, and may be translated as 'even however (A), still not (B)'. The whole structure itself is usually interpreted simply as 'it is meaningless to (A)', 'there's nothing one can do about (A)', or nothing will come of (A)'. どうにも will primarily be seen either at the start or end of sentences, after or before going on to explain a situation which seems impossible due to some specific reason. This grammar pattern emphasizes the speaker's feelings of resignation, frustration, or regret in relation to something that is out of their control. Due to this, it often highlights the actions of someone other than the speaker. Occasionally, どうにも is further emphasized by the addition of こうにも.",N1
どうやら,どうやら,,"Apparently, Looks Like, Seems like","どうやら can be translated as 'apparently', or 'it seems like', and is often grouped together with other phrases of speculation such as ようだ, そうだ, and らしい. Due to this, どうやら simply strengthens the uncertainty of things that the speaker is already unsure about. This is in a similar fashion to phrases like 'in some way it seems like (A)'. Like many adverbs that express amount or speculation, どうやら will appear at the beginning of sentences and modify the meaning of the entire phrase. Fun-fact While classified as a standalone adverb, どうやら is originally a combination of どう 'how' and やら, a 助詞 (particle) that is used for denoting uncertainty about singular things or lists. With this in mind, it is similar to the way that 'or whatever', or 'or some such' may be added to a sentence in English in order to emphasize that (A) is not certain.",N2
どころか,どころか,,"Far from, Anything but","どころか is a combination of the noun ところ 'place', and the sentence ending particle か. The change from ところ to どころ is a consistent sound change that is seen regularly in sentences that use 所 negatively. どころか may be translated as 'far from', 'let alone' or 'anything but'. It strongly negates any statement before it, while also emphasizing what comes after it. どころか may be paired with the attributive form of any other word. However, this is not a strict rule, as it can also be seen with the 語幹 stem form of な-Adjectives , and directly attached to nouns. Sentences that use どころか must always have a part (B) that emphasizes some type of far more important information (in the speaker's opinion). Fun Fact As か simply transforms どころ into either a question, or a statement of doubt, the literal translation of どころか is similar to 'it's not even remotely (A)' as a statement, or 'do you honestly think it's (A)!?', when asking a direct question.",N3
どころではない,どころではない,,"This is not the time for…, Far from, Out of the question","When the voiced form of ところ 'place', どころ appears in Japanese, it will very often be part of a set phrase expressing some kind of negative situation or evaluation. どころではない is no different, and highlights that it is 'far from (A)', or that '(A) is out of the question'. These translations appear when the actual situation is considered to be even more remarkable than the phrase that どころではない is attached to. This grammar pattern will be seen at the end of phrases indicating some situation which is not ideal. Additionally, ではない may be replaced with じゃない in more casual settings. どころではない may also sometimes be translated as 'it is not the time for (A)'. In sentences that use this interpretation, (A) is considered to be something that there is no allowance for due to there being far more important matters. This use will reflect the personal opinion of the speaker.",N2
どこ,どこ,n,Where,"どこ is one of the forms of the どれ family of words used to enquire about unknown things. In this case it asks about a place. Just like どれ represents 'which', どこ represents 'which place', or simply 'where'. Caution どこ should not be confused with どっち, a similar word which is also sometimes translated as 'where'. どっち focuses more on the direction that one is/is going, where どこ focuses purely on 'which place'.",N5
どの,どの,adj-na,"Which (of three or more), What (kind)","どの is classified as a 'pre-noun adjectival' in Japanese. These are a special type of word that do not conjugate, which means that they will always appear in the same form. どの comes from the same family of words as どれ and どこ , and is used for asking about 'which' thing someone will choose. In these examples, we can see that どの may be used to ask a question, or it may also be used in a similar way to 'whatever', or 'whichever' in English. Caution どの is only used when there are 3 or more possible choices, and どっち （ の ）・ どちら （ の ） will be used when there are only 2 possible choices. In the first example, the speaker is asking specifically about 2 options 'red or blue', so どっち will be used. However, in the second example, since the answer could be any color, どの will be used instead.",N5
どれ,どれ,n,Which (of three or more),"どれ is from the same family of words as これ , それ , and あれ . These words are called こそあど 言葉 in Japanese. Unlike the other 3, which all point to a specific thing, words starting with ど are designed for enquiring about something unknown. どれ can roughly be translated as 'which' in English, and is used for enquiring about a group (of 3 or more things). From these examples, we can see that the particle が is often used with どれ , especially when preceding questions. However, when どれ follows a noun, は will be used. When there are only two choices to select between, どちら + の ,  or どっち + の will be used instead of どれ . This is a habit that has become part of the language over time, and was not originally how these words were used.",N5
どんどん,どんどん,,"Progressively, Rapidly increasing, More and more","どんどん (or ドンドン) is one of the countless words in Japanese that represent a particular sound or sensation. These words are known as onomatopoeia (オノマトペ in Japanese). どんどん represents the sound of banging (like on a drum), or the pounding of feet. In this way, it is regularly translated as 'rapidly', or 'quickly'. Like だんだん , どんどん may be used before almost any phrase. While どんどん can take the particle と , it is not required. In fact, と is very often omitted from adverbs/onomatopoeic words in Japanese. Caution Initially, it can be easy to mix-up どんどん , with だんだん . だんだん is used to express slower changes, and may be thought of as similar to 'steadily', or 'step by step' in English. Fun Fact When the と particle is used with onomatopoeic words, it is very similar to one of と 's main usages as a quotation marker in Japanese. This means that と has a similar role to words like 'went', or 'goes' in English. For example, In English, we would say: The door 'goes' BANG with the wind. However, the door doesn't actually 'go' anywhere. This is similar to what と is doing here.",N4
どんなに～ても,どんなに〜ても,,No matter how,"As explained in the そんな grammar point, the こそあど言葉（こと ば ） may occasionally be seen in the forms こんな, そんな , あんな , or どんな . どんな itself is an abbreviation of どのような, meaning 'in what way', or 'what kind of'. When partnered with に (creating an adverb), and ても , どんなに～ても is used express a extent of something that is insufficient. It can be translated as 'no matter how (A), (B)'. どんなに may be attached to any type of word, so long as that word is then followed by でも (in the case of nouns or な-Adjectives ) or ても (in the case of い-Adjectives or verbs). どんなに～ても can literally be translated as 'even if (A) is in however/whatever (way), (B)'.",N3
ない内に,ないうちに,,"Before it becomes, Before ~ occurs, Without","In contrast to うちに, which is often used to express the 'optimal', or 'best' time within which something should occur, ないうちに expresses the time within which something 'does not' occur, and results in (or causes) something negative, or will cause something negative if not dealt with. This means that 'before (A) happens (B)', or 'without (A) happening, (B). うちに will be paired with verbs in their ない (negative) form, before the (B) phrase highlights something that 'is done to prevent (A) from happening', or 'happened unfortunately during (A)'. Fun Fact 前 に and ないうちに are used in very similar situations, with the primary difference being that ないうちに focuses more on unfavorable results.",N3
ない事には～ない,ないことには～ない,,Unless you do something,"ないことには～ない is a 2-part structure in Japanese that is used to express that 'unless you do (A), (B) will not happen or exist'. This is a combination of ない, こと, に, は, and then something followed by ない in the (B) part of the sentence. Literally, it just means 'within the situation of (A) not being a thing, neither will (B)'. This structure may appear with verbs and い-Adjectives in their ない forms, or nouns followed by でない. In sentences that use ないことには～ない , (A) can be considered the condition for (B) being able to occur or proceed. Caution Occasionally, ないことには will be seen in sentences that do not finish with a word in the negative form. In these cases, ないことには implies that not being in the state of (A) will negatively affect (B). This translates similarly to 'without (A), unfortunately (B)', and often has structures like しまう following (B).",N2
ない事はない,ないことはない,,"Is not impossible, It doesn't mean that it isn't","ないことはない is an expression that utilizes either the auxiliary verb ない, or the い-Adjective ない, depending on what type of word it is used with. This structure may literally be translated as something similar to 'not (A) is not all there is'. However, the common translations are '(A) is not impossible', or 'it doesn't mean that it isn't (A)'. This expression may be used with the ない form of any verb, い-Adjective , or な-Adjective . Let's have a look at a few examples before exploring the meaning further. By itself, ことはない highlights something that is unneeded, or never happens. This is partly due to the adverbial particle は expressing something as being 'complete'. In this way, 'there is no situation in which (A)', is quite an accurate translation of ことはない. By adding ない to the (A) verb, all ないことはない is doing is simply changing this nuance to 'there is -not- no situation in which (A)', a double negative expressing that (A) is actually possible. Fun Fact ないことはない often appears with verbs in the potential form. This usually implies a lack of effort, or feelings of half heartedness toward the completion of (A). It is similar to 'it's not like I can't (A)' in English.",N3
～ないで下さい,ないでください,exp,Please don't (Polite request),"ないでください is an expression that is used to politely ask someone 'not' to do something. It is a combination of the casual negative form of a verb, the で particle, and ください (the conjunctive form of くださる). ください is classified as honorific language , a type of polite speech that is used to refer to the actions of other people. The ください form of くださる is used almost exclusively for making requests. くださる is the honorific language equivalent of くれる . In friendly conversation, ください may be omitted from this expression, and the で form itself can be used as a very casual way of saying 'please don't do (A)'. Caution Although ください is the polite form of くれる , ください is considered the base form of this phrase, and ないでくれ (the conjunctive form of くれる ) would be considered far too casual in most situations.",N5
ないではいられない,ないではいられない,,"Cannot help doing something, Cannot resist doing something","In order to express that something cannot be helped or cannot be resisted in Japanese, the phrase ないではいられない will be used. This is a structure that is comprised of verbs in the negative form connected to で, は, and the negative-potential form of the る-Verb 居 る 'to be'. In this way it just means 'to be unable to be without (A)'. ないではいられない primarily expresses the inability of the speaker to tolerate (A) not happening, due to wanting to do it. It may also indicate that they will unfortunately do it despite knowing that they shouldn't. ないではいられない may also be used to highlight that in the situation of (A), some particular emotion, feeling, or reaction cannot be repressed. (B) is something that happens naturally as a consequence of (A).",N2
ないでもない,ないでもない,,"Kind of, Might, Slightly, It’s not (impossible) that, Somewhat, In some respects","ないでもない , and なくもない are structures that have the literal meaning of 'to not not be (A)', and are used to express that something is 'a little (A)', or 'kinda (A)'. These structures are used primarily when the speaker can neither confirm or deny (A), but may also be used simply when not wanting to directly disagree with something that another person has said. Both ないでもない and なくもない may be used after either the negated form of verbs, or nouns followed by the case marking particle が. ないでもない and なくもない are completely interchangeable, with the primary difference simply being that なくもない is less frequently used. Additionally, ないものでもない may also be seen, but just like なくもない , it is far less common.",N1
ないで,ないで,,"Without doing, Not ~ and ~","There are two primary ways in which ないで is used with verbs in Japanese. The first is to express 'without doing (A), (B)'. The second is to request that someone 'not do (A)'. We will examine the first in this write-up. ないで is a combination of the auxiliary verb ない, and the particle で . Due to this, で keeps its standard meaning of 'with/by', in relation to 'not' doing something. When ないで is used to express that '(A) has not been done before doing (B)', this is usually contrary to some kind of expectation. Because of this, ないで is often used to express something that may be surprising to the listener. Caution Be careful of the following two structures: (A) ないで (B) - Without doing (A), (B). (A) なくて (B) - Without doing (A), (B). Technically, these two constructions share a similar meaning. However, in modern Japanese ないで is used more frequently when the (B) action is being highlighted as being done without (A). On the other hand, なくて is used when (A) is being given as a reason for why something else was/wasn't done.",N4
ないと,ないと,,"Must, Have to","As an extension of the 'if' meaning of と , attaching the auxiliary verb ない to the verb before it will express 'if (A) is not done, (B)'. (B) is most frequently いけない 'cannot go', which makes ないといけない a double negative phrase, which translates to 'must do (A)', or 'have to do (A)'. いけない may be replaced with だめ, to make the phrase more casual, but ならない is generally not used with ないと . ないといけない is regularly abbreviated to ないと , but has exactly the same meaning in these cases. Caution As と has the 'and' nuance, it gives ないと a level of strength that is not seen in similar phrases like なければいけない , or なくてはいけない . Because of this, ないと is often used to highlight things which absolutely 'must' be done (obeying the law, adhering to customs, using common sense, etc.).",N4
ない方がいい,ないほうがいい,exp,"It'd be better not to, Shouldn't do","Like たほうがいい , ないほうがいい is used in Japanese for giving advice. However, this expression suggests that it is better 'not' to do something. This phrase is constructed by using the negative form of a verb grouped with 方 , the particle が , and the い-Adjective , いい . As 方 can be translated closely to 'way', or 'direction', this expression is suggesting that one specific choice is simply the better 'way'. This expression is quite direct, and can imply that there may be some sort of negative consequence if the (A) verb is done.",N5
ないまでも,ないまでも,,"May not … but (at least), Even though not, Even if not","ないまでも is a combination of the negated form of a verb, the case-marking particle まで 'until', and the adverbial particle も 'even'. It will often be translated as 'even though not (A), (B)', or 'it may not be (A), but (B)'. This structure usually presents some form of extreme (A) which has not yet been reached, but the lower extent of (B) cannot be denied. The literal translation is 'even though not reaching (A), (B)'. Depending on the source, this structure may occasionally be used with nouns. In this case, it will need to follow ではない, or the casual じゃない. This grammar pattern will be used in both positive and negative situations. For example, (A) may be the best outcome, where (B) is something just below that which is desirable, or (A) may be the worst outcome, where (B) is just below that, but still quite bad. Often, the (B) phrase will express some kind of wish or demand that the speaker wants to meet with structures like たい, てほしい, てください, たらどう, つもり, といい, etc.",N1
ない訳にはいかない',ないわけにはいかない,,"Can't not, No way to avoid","As an extension of the grammar pattern 訳 にはいかない 'can't afford to do (A)', or 'impossible to do (A)', ない 訳 にはいかない creates a double negative which is frequently translated simply as 'can't not (A)', or 'no way to avoid (A)'. As this is a combination of the negated form of a verb, 訳 'reason', or 'logic', に, は, and the negated form of 行 く, the literal meaning is just 'there's no reason that (A) can't be done', or 'it cannot be so that (A) won't be done'. Compared to other similar structures like なければならない, ないといけない, and various others, ない 訳 にはいかない implies that there are some circumstances as to why (A) cannot be avoided, so will often be used when giving an excuse or reasoning as to why one must do (A).",N2
ない～はない,～ない～はない,,There is not ~ that is not/does not,"～ない～はない is an example of a double negative in Japanese, and is a grammar construction that requires careful attention in order not to incorrectly interpret. Both the い-Adjective ( 形容詞 ), and auxiliary verb forms of ない may be used in this construction, depending on what type of word is being negated. Let's take a look at a few examples. Literally, this grammar pattern is very similar to 'there isn't an (A) that doesn't (B)' in English. Caution This term is not to to be confused with なくはない , a more advanced grammar pattern which means 'It's not that it isn't (A)'.",N4
直す,なおす,,"To do over, To redo","直 す is a verb that means 'to fix', or 'to redo'. It is used when saying that something needs to be done a second time (usually due to the result/quality being insufficient the first time). To use 直 す , it will need to be attached to the ます stem form of any verb. With する verbs, the conjugation rules are slightly different. する will become し, and then 直 す will be connected in the regular fashion. In some situations, する may be replaced with やる (a very casual equivalent of する ). As やる is a う-Verb , it will be conjugated as やり 直 す . Caution 直 す (to fix) should not be confused with 治 す (to heal/mend). The kanji 直 literally means 'straight', or 'direct', and implies that one should 'straighten out' something.",N4
尚①,なお①,,"Still, Even, Yet","When used at the beginning of a statement, the adverb 尚 'furthermore' will often carry the meaning of 'still', 'even', or 'yet'. This use is regularly seen after the previous statement ends in も, and will emphasize that 'even after (A)', or 'even though (A) is a fact, (B) is still true'. Especially when the information expressed in the (B) part of the sentence is surprising or shocking in some way. This structure will almost always appear without the kanji being used. Additionally, the (B) part of statements that include 尚 will also frequently include も, in order to specify that the new information is 'in addition to (A)'. 今 もなお has come to be used as a set phase, and may be heard in may different situations. Despite this, 尚 itself is quite a formal grammar structure.",N2
尚②,なお②,,"In addition, Incidentally, Furthermore, Moreover","When used at the beginning of a sentence, the adverb 尚 'furthermore' will often carry the meaning of 'in addition', 'furthermore', 'even more', or 'moreover'. This use is regularly seen after the previous sentence or clause has expressed some base fact or situation that the second sentence will then add to. Especially when the information expressed in the (B) part of the sentence is surprising or shocking in some way. This structure will almost always appear without the kanji being used. As 尚 is a formal grammar structure, it will most frequently appear in letters, posters, commercials and other similar material. Fun-fact In all of its uses, なお simply indicates that taking the previous information of (A) into account, although (B) may not be expected, it is in fact true. This can be used either positively or negatively, and just highlights (B) as exceeding expectations.",N2
中々～ない,なかなか～ない,,"Not really, Hardly, Not easily or readily, By no means, Far from","When used positively, なかなか means to be 'very', or 'considerably' something. However, when used in a sentence that has a verb in the ない (or ありません) form, it carries the meaning of 'not at all', 'hardly', or 'far from'. Quite often, this expression is used to highlight something that the speaker expects should happen, but for some reason does/is not. To use なかなか (or 中々 in its kanji form), なかなか will be put at the beginning of a phrase (or directly before the negative verb), before further describing the situation. Fun Fact As 中々 just means the 'middle' of something, this expression can be thought of as highlighting that something is not in the 'middle' (optimal place to achieve a certain result). Due to this, it often expresses that the speaker wants something to be in that 'optimal position' but feels frustration due to the fact that it isn't.",N3
中々,なかなか,,"Very, Quite, Considerably","なかなか (or 中々 in kanji) is an adverb in Japanese that is frequently translated as 'very', or 'considerably'. It is regularly paired directly with other adjectives, or before nouns (with の coming between なかなか and the noun). なかなか can also sometimes have the nuance of being something that is 軽視 し がたい . This basically translates as 'difficult to dismiss', but is a bit closer to English expressions like 'nothing to scoff at', or 'not to be taken lightly'. Fun Fact なかなか highlights that something is 'considerably/extremely (A)', or 'far more (A) than expected'. If we imagine a dartboard, where the whole board shows the intensity level of a specific word, and なかなか represents the bullseye, this is basically the nuance. '(A) is the middle (bullseye) example of (B)'. Fun Fact なかなか, coming from the kanji 中 meaning 'within', can be thought to mean the 'middle' or 'most' (A).",N3
ながら,ながらに,,"While being, Born (with), Traditional (old-fashioned, as it was long ago), As always, While crying or in tears, (Burned) alive","When combined with the case-marking particle に, ながら 'while' as a suffix will indicate that something remains in the state of (A), while also having or doing (B). This can be translated as 'while being (A), (B)', or '(A) as always (B)'. ながらに will be seen following nouns, or verbs in their stem form. Additionally, して may be added to the end of に, without any change to the nuance. ながらに is a structure that has many potential translations in English, but the key point to remember is that (B) is something that is being highlighted as happening or existing in same state as (A) in an unchanged state. This doesn't necessarily mean at the same time. For example, in the case of 生 まれながらに, it can be translated as '(B) has existed since birth', but what it really means is that 'while being in the state of (A), (B) is still there'. Caution ながらに tends to only be used with a limited set of words, so it is best not to use it with structures that you have not already seen at some point in the past.",N1
ながらも,ながらも,,"But, Even while, Even though, Despite, Although","ながらも is a combination of the conjunction particle ながら, and the adverbial particle も. Coming from the kanji 乍 ら, with the meaning of 'while', ながら almost always keeps this nuance. Because of this, ながらも can be translated as 'even while (A), (B)', or 'although (A), also (B)'. ながらも usually expresses surprise at the coexistence of (A) and (B), and may be used after い-Adjectives , な-Adjectives , nouns, or the conjunctive form of verbs. ながらも is used to highlight a thing that comes after the existing state of (A) 'そのままで 後 に 続 く 事 '. Due to this, ながらも may only be used with verbs that highlight states of existence (like feelings), rather than ongoing actions.",N3
ながら,ながら,,"While ~ing, During, As","ながら is another conjunction particle in Japanese that has two primary different meanings. These meanings are as follows: 同時 の 動 き - Two things that are existing/happening simultaneously. 確定 の 逆説 - Two things that are unexpectedly existing/happening simultaneously. We will focus purely on the 同時 の 動 き meaning in this grammar point. To use ながら , simply add it to the ます stem of verb (A), and then highlight verb (B) as part of the following clause. This may be translated simply as 'while' in English. Grammatically, the (B) action is considered to be the 'important' action, while the (A) action expresses the timeline within which (B) takes place. Caution Due to the (B) action being considered the 'primary' action of something that (A) is related to, (A) and (B) must have the same subject. Fun Fact When used to express 確定 の 逆説 , ながら will be followed by も . ながらも is a separate grammar point that we will learn more about later. In this construction, も is expressing surprise about the fact that (A) and (B) coexist.",N4
なくしては,なくして(は),,"Without, If not for","なくしては is a hypothetical expression that indicates that 'if not for (A), then not (B)'. It may appear as either なしには, なしでは, or なくしては , with little variation in meaning. It is a combination of the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective ない, なく, the conjunction particle して, which highlights the word before it as a condition from which a determination can be made, and the adverbial particle は. As the second part of なくしては sentences will also be negative, we can see the more literal meaning of 'from the lack of (A), a lack of (B) can be determined'. This 'determination' comes across quite strongly, and may be interpreted as '(B) is impossible without (A)'. なくしては will appear after either nouns, or phrases that have been nominalized with こと. As mentioned previously, なしには and なしでは may also be seen. These are just the noun 無 し 'without', paired with either of the particle combinations には or では. なくしては is the most formal of the three. The (B) part of なくしては sentences will almost always be some state of completion or desirable outcome that cannot be achieved without (A).",N1
なくちゃ,なくちゃ・なきゃ,exp,"Must do, Have to do","なくちゃ (short for なくては ), and なきゃ (short for なければ ) are the most common colloquial abbreviations used to convey that something 'must', or 'has to' be done. Like てはいけない (must not), なくてはいけない (must), and なくてはならない (must), these abbreviation forms can be followed by いけない , ならない , or だめ. However, they are usually omitted, without changing the meaning. Structures like this are referred to as spoken/colloquial language . These casual variations can come across in a very similar way to words like 'gotta' in English. In these examples, a variety of forms have been used naturally. There is no 'most natural' form, and it will often depend on the speaker as to which they choose. As with almost all grammatical structures, the shortest variations (not including いけない , etc.) are the most casual/used the most often. There are several other ways that these common abbreviations can appear based on region, or even an individual speaker's preference. An example of this is なけりゃ, which is a (very) casual form of なければ . In this example, we can see that some of these less common variations are used specifically by certain genders (in general). なけりゃ itself tends to be used by male speakers, and may be considered a bit rougher than なきゃ , or なくちゃ , which can be used by anybody.",N5
なきゃ,なくちゃ・なきゃ,exp,"Must do, Have to do","なくちゃ (short for なくては ), and なきゃ (short for なければ ) are the most common colloquial abbreviations used to convey that something 'must', or 'has to' be done.

なくてはいけない,なくてはいけない,exp,"Must do, Have to do","Much like てはいけない , なくてはいけない states that something 'must not' be done. However, this is where the similarities end. なくてはいけない is an example of a double negative in Japanese, and actually has the meaning '(A) must be done', or 'must do (A)'. While this grammar point is usually translated as 'must do', the literal translation is 'must not, not do (A)'. This double 'not' is where many learners have difficulties. いけない simply means 'cannot go', and comes from the negative potential form of 行 く. To use this structure, simply create the negative form of a verb, and then convert ない to なく (the conjunctive form of an い-Adjective ), followed by て . After this, は is added, and then finally いけない . いけない is considered to be the most common structure used with the 'must', and 'must not' grammar points, and is natural in both speech, and written Japanese. Alternatively, ならない may be used in formal speech, but is much better suited to writing. だめ is also acceptable, but much more casual than either いけない or ならない . Caution The ては in なくては is often converted to ちゃ, as this is easier to say. なくちゃ may then be followed by いけない , or いけない may be omitted, without changing the meaning. These casual structures are very similar to words like 'gotta' in English.",N5
なくてはならない,なくてはならない,exp,"Must do, Have to do","Much like てはならない , なくてはならない states that something 'must not' be done. However, this is where the similarities end. なくてはならない is an example of a double negative in Japanese, and actually has the meaning '(A) must be done', or 'must do (A)'. While this grammar point is usually translated as 'must do', the literal translation is 'must not, not do (A)'. This double 'not' is where many learners have difficulties. ならない simply means 'cannot become', and comes from the negative form of なる . To use this structure, simply create the negative form of a verb, and then convert ない to なく (the conjunctive form of an い-Adjective ), followed by て . After this, は is added, and then finally ならない . ならない is considered to be the most formal structure out of ならない , いけない , and だめ. It is regularly used in formal writing, or semi-formal/formal speech. いけない (the most common variation) and だめ (the most casual variation) are also acceptable in many situations. Caution The ては in なくては is often shortened to ちゃ, as this is easier to say. なくちゃ may then be followed by ならない . However, due to ならない being quite formal, なくちゃ (a casual structure) will not be used with ならない on a regular basis. It is more common to see なくちゃ paired with いけない , or だめ. These casual structures are very similar to words like 'gotta' in English.",N5
なくてもいい,なくてもいい,,Don't have to,"なくてもいい is simply the opposite of てもいい , and highlights that it is 'ok even if (A) is not done'. This usually comes across as being quite polite, and sounds like 'don't worry about doing (A)' in English. なくてもいい is a combination of the auxiliary verb ない in its conjunction form, with てもいい . In order to make this phrase sound even more casual, the adverbial particle も may be omitted. This does not change the nuance at all, but will sound a bit more friendly (when used with people that you know well).",N4
なくて,なくて,,"To not ~ and ~, Not ~ and ~ (Conjugations)","In Japanese, なくて is a construction that combines ない (in its conjugation form, なく), with the conjunction particle て . This results in the same 'and' meaning as the standard て form, but with the negative meaning of ない. なくて can be translated as 'to not (A), and…', or 'not (A), and…', depending on what type of word it is used with. As discussed in our initial lesson about ない, there are two forms of this particular word. One form is an auxiliary verb, and is used with verbs. The other form of ない is an い-Adjective ( 形容詞 ), and is used with nouns, な-Adjectives , and い-Adjectives . The difference between these two, is that the い-Adjective form may have は in between it and the word it is connected to ( では in the case of nouns and な-Adjectives ). With verbs, due to ない being an auxiliary verb , this is not possible. Caution なくて is very similar to ないで , another structure that is regularly used with verbs (but may not be used with nouns or adjectives). ないで is far more common when expressing 'not doing' something, while なくて tends to be used almost exclusively for expressing reasons/causes.",N4
なくて,なくて,,"Not ~ and, Not so, Because not (Examples)","In Japanese, なくて is a construction that combines ない (in its conjugation form, なく), with the conjunction particle て . This results in the same 'and' meaning as the standard て form, but with the negative meaning of ない. なくて is often used when the phrase that comes before it is being highlighted as an example/reason for a specific result. In these situations, the translation is usually 'because not (A), (B)', or 'because I didn't (A), (B)'. When なくて is used in this way, it is often followed by the speaker's feelings (in the form of an adjective), verbs in the potential form, or something that is generally beyond the control of the speaker. It is due to this fact that the result is 'beyond control' that the translation becomes 'because'. Some examples of words that express things beyond the control of the speaker are 困 る (to be troubled), 嬉 しい (to be happy), 疲 れている (to feel weary), 心配 (to feel anxiety/worry), 安心 (to feel relief).",N4
なくはない',なくはない,,"It's not that…, Kind of, might, Slightly, Somewhat, In some respects","Used to express that something is 'slightly (A)', 'somewhat (A)', or 'in some respects (A)' in Japanese is the phrase なくはない . This is comprised of ない in its なく (conjunctive) form connected to either verbs or nouns, は, and ない. The literal meaning of this structure is close to 'it's not that it isn't (A)', and is a type of double negative. Although preceded mostly by verbs, this structure sometimes appears following nouns. When that is the case, が, は, or sometimes even に may be between なくはない and the noun. Additionally, the は in なくはない is interchangeable with も, with only a slight strengthening of the nuance when も is used. This structure often appears with the potential form of verbs, in order to show that something is not impossible, despite appearances or what one may think.",N2
なければいけない,なければいけない,,"Must do, Have to do","Like なくてはいけない , なければいけない is a structure that implies that something 'must be done'. However, it is important to remember that this is actually a double negative, and therefore means 'If (A) is not done, it cannot go', or more simply '(A) cannot not be done'. To make this construction, the auxiliary verb ない will need to be conjugated with ば , creating なければ (if not). After this, いけない (to not be able to go) will be added to the end. As learned in the なきゃ lesson, なければ may be shortened to なきゃ . This structure is frequently used either with or without the added いけない . Caution While いけない (to not be able to go) and ならない (to not become) are quite similar, ならない will rarely be used outside of formal situations, or in writing. Due to this, いけない will be heard much more frequently in speech (when it is not omitted).",N4
なければならない,なければならない,,"Must do, Have to do","Like なければいけない , なければならない is a structure that implies that something 'must be done'. However, it is important to remember that this is actually a double negative, and therefore means 'If (A) is not done, it cannot become', or more simply '(A) cannot not be done'. To make this construction, the auxiliary verb ない will need to be conjugated with ば , creating なければ (if not). After this, ならない (to not become) will be added to the end. As we learned in the なきゃ lesson, なければ may be shortened to なきゃ . This structure is frequently used, either with or without the added ならない . Caution While いけない (to not be able to go) and ならない (to not become) are quite similar, ならない will rarely be used outside of formal situations, or in writing. Due to this, いけない will be heard much more frequently in speech (when it is not omitted).",N4
なさい,なさい,,Command to do,"なさい is the imperative form of なさる, an honorific language verb which specifically highlights and respects the actions of another person (never the speaker). Despite being respectful, the fact that this is a 'command' means that it would never be used toward a superior. Due to this, なさい is most frequently used toward peers, or people of lower status, like children. To use なさい , simply connect it to the ます stem of any verb. なさい may be shortened further to な, which becomes an even more casual form that is used most frequently toward peers. Caution Be careful not to get confused between な (the particle), and な (the shortened form of なさい ). These can seem very similar, but な (meaning don't) will always be used with the dictionary form of a verb, while な (meaning please do) will always be used with the ます stem of a verb.",N4
なさる,なさる,,To do (Honorific),"なさる is an honorific language verb which acknowledges and respects the actions of another (never the speaker). Like お～になる , なさる has exactly the same meaning as する . なさる can be utilized in any situation where する would be used, as a direct replacement. It is a special-class verb, which means that it has some unique conjugation rules. In its casual form, it will conjugate in exactly the same way as a う-Verb . However, in the polite form, instead of る changing to り (as would be expected of a う-Verb ), it will change to い instead. Caution Although some Japanese speakers will use it, expressions like なさって いらっしゃる are considered double keigo ( なさる is honorific language , and いらっしゃる is also honorific language ), and are technically incorrect. However, なさる may be partnered with ます, which is simply polite speech . Fun Fact なさる is considered a little bit old fashioned in modern Japanese, and お～になる is the preferred form used by most native speakers.",N4
無し,なし,,"Without, No","Although it is used almost exclusively as a suffix , なし is actually a noun that means ないこと 'thing without'. なし , or 無 し when using kanji, will be used after nouns that it is indicating as 'not having (A)'. Depending on what the speaker wants to convey, なし is often partnered with the auxiliary verb だ , or its conjunctive form で. なしで will mean '(A) that is without (B)'. When connected directly to another noun, の will be required after なし . Again, this will mean '(A) that is without (B)'. なし does not always need to be connected directly to another noun. Often, it can be used in reference to an event or thing that someone wants to skip, or avoid. In cases like this, it may be paired with the case marking particle に , to show determination to avoid something. Caution 無 し is quite different to 抜 き, another suffix-like structure that is used to convey 'without (A)'. The primary difference is in the original meanings of these words. Having a relationship with ない, なし simply means 'without'. 抜 き comes from the う - Verb 抜 く 'to remove'. Due to this, 抜 き implies the intentional removal of something. Often 抜 き and 無 し are interchangeable, but not always.",N3
なぜなら,なぜなら〜から,,"Because, The reason is, That is because","When combined with the conjunction particle から, なぜなら (or なぜならば ) forms a set pattern that can be translated as 'why (A), that is because (B)'. Essentially, it is a way to highlight that a 'because' is coming at the end of the sentence, drawing attention to it. なぜなら itself is a conjunction that is a combination of the adverb , なぜ 'why', and the hypothetical form of だ , なら . Literally, なぜなら～から is similar to 'why is (A) so, (B) is the cause'. This sounds quite dramatic in English, but is a perfectly natural way of emphasizing a statement/fact in Japanese. To use なぜなら～から , state that fact/important piece of information as (A). Then, at the beginning of a new sentence, なぜなら will be followed by the reason/cause, with から finishing the sentence. The primary function of なぜなら in Japanese (as opposed to simply using から or ので by itself) is to gain the attention of the listener, and inform them that important information is coming.",N3
等,など,,"Such as, Things like, Etc., And so on","など is an adverbial particle that is used to express that something is being presented as an example, but that other things in the same category also exist. In this way, it is regularly translated as 'such as', 'things like', or 'and so on'. など may be used after nouns, to describe that (A) is being presented as an example from within a group. Alternatively, など can be followed by の (B), to show that (A) is only one type of thing from the broader category, (B). など is regularly seen in its kanji form, 等 . This kanji itself has a similar meaning to 'etc' in English. Fun Fact The kanji for 等 is also used in the pluralizing suffix, ら . Due to this, we can see that this kanji is regularly utilized to highlight something that exists as part of a larger group. In the first sentence, など presents (A) as being part of a larger group of similar things. This is exactly the same thing that happens in the second sentence with ら . Fun Fact など is also sometimes written as なんか , and has an interchangeable meaning in many situations. However, なんか will never use the kanji form of 等 .",N4
何+,なにか・なにも,n,"Something, Nothing, Anything, Not anything, Some kind of, Not any kind of","何 か and 何 も are constructions that are used in Japanese for expressing 'something', 'anything', or 'nothing'. The main difference between the two being that 何 も is used with negative phrases (phrases that use ない or ありません ), while 何 か is used in other cases. To use this expression, we simply need to put 何 か or 何 も before the desired phrase. Caution There are several casual forms of these expressions that are used in speech, or in certain dialects. These forms are なんにか , なんか , or なんにも , なんも .",N5
ならでは,ならでは,,"Unique to, Only, Impossible if not, Expected only of","ならでは is a construction which indicates that something is 'unique to (A)', or 'impossible if not (A)'. While ならでは is usually considered as its own standalone word, it is actually just a combination of the negative- conjunctive form of the the classical copula なり, ならで, with the addition of the adverbial particle は. ならでは will follow nouns, and the sentence will then usually go on to say what the thing is that is unique to (A). As seen in the above examples, ならでは will only be used when something is being evaluated positively. As a result of this, it is very common to see in advertising and slogans. Caution ならでは may be seen directly before the auxiliary verb だ. In these cases, the thing that is unique to (A) will have been expressed earlier in the sentence, or will be obvious from context. Based on the history of ならでは , the structure being the negative- conjunctive form of the copula なり means that it is basically identical in meaning of the more modern でなくては 'if it isn't (A)'.",N1
ならともかく,ならともかく,,"If it's (A), sure, but (B), Putting aside (A), (B)","When なら, the hypothetical form of the auxiliary verb だ is paired with the adverb ともかく 'to set aside', it will often be translated as 'if it is (A), sure, but not in the case of (B)', or more simply 'putting (A) aside, (B)'. This structure usually just indicates that if it were (A), then the result or situation would be different, but because it is not (A), the result or situation is not different (it is as it currently is). なら is often classified as and functions in the same way as an adverbial particle, meaning that it will primarily be appended to the plain form of nouns, verbs, or adjectives. However, ならともかく itself is used mainly after nouns. For more details about ともかく, please see the fun fact on the はともかく lesson page!",N2
ならいざ知らず’,ならいざ知らず,,"Don’t know about it, Maybe it would or might be possible for","ならいざ 知 らず is a grammar expression which combines the hypothetical form of the auxiliary verb だ, なら, the adverb いざ ‘now’, or ‘well then’, and the classically-negated form of the う-Verb 知 る, 知 らず ‘to not know’. It is often translated as ‘I don’t know about (A), but (B)’, or ‘maybe (A), but (B). This phrase is formal, and usually used to emphasize that, regardless of (A), (B) fits a specific description. ならいざ 知 らず will follow verbs in their standard forms . Additionally, it may follow either な-Adjectives or nouns that have had their terminal だ replaced with なら. Just like the literal translation of ‘if it’s (A), well then I don’t know’, this structure emphasizes that (A) may or may not be the case, but (B) is definite. However, there is no direct use of ‘but’ in Japanese. This shows that the ‘but’ comes from the simple contrast of (A) being unknown while (B) is known. ならいざ 知 らず may also be seen following other structures such as い-Adjectives when they have been nominalized with の. This の pattern is also used with verbs, but it is less common than simply attaching ならいざしらず to one of the standard verb forms. Fun Fact In many cases, (A) is an extreme example used to show that (B) is the opposite of that, and is therefore either surprising or irritating. Caution Occasionally は will be used instead of なら. However, the meaning of the overall phrase will remain the same.",N1
ならまだしも,ならまだしも,,"A is fine...but B is not, If it's ~ then it is ok...but ~ is not, It's different when...but, It's not so bad when...but","ならまだしも is a combination of なら 'if', まだ 'still', and the adverbial particle しも, which has the primary purpose of strengthening the word that comes before it. When used, this structure will often be translated as '(A) is fine, but not (B)', or '(A) is fine, but it's different when it's (B)'. ならまだしも is a phrase that usually separates the first and second half of sentences, so will be attached to the end of the (A) phrase, marking the statement that is acceptable. Due to the way that しも alters まだ, a more literal translation of this grammar point can be thought of as 'if it's (A), then of course there's still that, but as for (B)'. Fun Fact しも is a classical particle that is not frequently used in modern times outside of set phrases or expressions like ならまだしも , 今 しも 'right this moment', and だれしも 'absolutely anybody'. In all cases, it merely strengthens the word directly before it.",N1
なら〜で,なら〜で,,"If ~ should, Before ~ should","なら〜で is a structure which appears in situations where the same word will repeat twice, followed by some sort of opinion in regard to it. It can be translated as 'if (A), you should (B)', or 'before (A), you should (B)'. In many cases it will be used to exhibit the speaker's dissatisfaction about something. なら〜で may follow verbs in their standard forms , い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns. Both なら and で are functioning as conjunction particles in this grammar pattern. Caution This nuance is different to ば～で, なら〜で , and たら～たで, which are used when conveying that something either is or is not an issue in relation to (A). With this pattern, なら〜で will only appear following な-Adjectives.",N1
なら,なら,,"Were it, If, If it's the case, As for (Conditional)","As mentioned in our lesson about ば , なら is often used by itself to mean 'if'. This is considered to be an abbreviation of ならば , the hypothetical form of なり, a classical auxiliary verb that is not used much in modern Japanese. Because なり originally meant 'to be', it functions in a similar way to the auxiliary verb だ . This means that it regularly pairs with nouns, or phrases that have been nominalized (become noun-like), through the use of の . However, unlike だ (or です ), なら is also regularly used without the extra help of の for nominalization, and can be attached directly to verbs or い-Adjectives . Caution Because なら is an abbreviation of ならば , it is strictly used when making guesses about what 'may', or what 'could' happen in certain situations. This means that it will not be used as 'if' in statements about results that are produced through some sort of effort/training. Fun Fact Although なら comes from the classical auxiliary verb なり, it should not be confused with the particle なり, which often has the meaning of 'as soon as', or 'just after'. Thankfully, the particle なり is also quite uncommon in modern Japanese.",N4
なりに,なりに,,"In one's own way, Of someone's own, Do one's best in one's own way, As much as one can","When used as a noun, なり often presents an example group from which something exhibits traits of, regardless of whether that group is actually a good example of the trait being described. This use can be translated as 'for (A) do to (C) in the way of (B)'. Or more simply, 'to do its best in its own way', or 'to do as much as one can'. This use stems from 形 , meaning 'shape' or 'pattern', and can be thought of as meaning 'in the pattern of'. In these sentences, (A) will be a specific example from within a group, (B) will be representative of the whole group, and (C), will be the trait or behavior in question related to (B). Either of the case marking particle s に or の will come after なり, depending on whether なり is linked directly to a noun, or is being used adverbially. なりに and なりの may follow almost any word in its plain form , with the word it follows being the group or quality that is being represented. This use of なり is considered a neologism, which is a pre-existing word that has been adapted to have a new meaning or nuance. When used this way, なり will almost always express that (A) is not doing something adequately or as desired, but is doing the best it can based on the 'pattern' or 'mold' that it comes from.",N1
なり,なり,,"As soon as, The moment, When","なり is an old-fashioned particle in Japanese that has several different uses. One of those uses is to convey the meaning of 'as soon as (A), (B)', or 'the moment of (A), (B)'. This structure will follow the dictionary form of verbs and is classified as a conjunction particle . (B) is usually something that is surprising, and brought about by a strong sense of will or emotion. Additionally, なり is almost always used in relation to other people, rather than oneself. Fun Fact Despite appearing to be a conjugation of the う-Verb なる 'to become' at first glance, なり is actually one of the readings of 形 , meaning 'shape', and refers to the overall situation of (A) in a similar way to ところ.",N1
なるべく,なるべく,,"As ~ as possible, Wherever practicable","Combining 成 る (to become), and 可 く (to be permissible), なるべく is an expression that literally means 'as each opportunity becomes permissible/presents itself'. This is often simply translated as 'as much as possible', or 'whenever possible'. なるべく (usually written in hiragana) is regularly used before an entire phrase, to express that (A) should happen as much as possible. Due to なるべく expressing the 'possibility', or 'having the opportunity' to do something, it will sound considerably softer/more polite than できるだけ. できるだけ is a similar expression which more directly states that something will be done 'to the full extent possible'.",N4
なんて,なんか・なんて,,"Such as, Things like, Emphasis","なんか is an expression in Japanese that is frequently associated with the adverbial particle など . They are thought to have overlapping meanings in many circumstances, and なんか itself may be considered an adverbial particle . なんて is an extension of this, and may be considered an abbreviation of などという 'to say something like'. Both なんか and なんて are used in the same way as など , having translations like 'such as', and 'things like' in English. The primary difference between なんか and なんて is that なんて is far more common after 用言 (conjugatable words). This includes verbs, い-Adjectives , and な-Adjectives . On the other hand, なんか is almost exclusively used after 体言 (unconjugatable words). In other words, nouns. Despite the 体言 and 用言 tendency, most native speakers will not consider it incorrect to use either なんか or なんて with any type of word. Fun Fact Both なんか and なんて are often used to show a low evaluation of the word that they follow. This can come across as humility when used in relation to oneself, or as an insult when used in relation to others. Don't let this point stop you from using なんか or なんて though, as many native speakers use it simply to fill the silence in modern Japanese.",N3
何+,なん,,"Some, Several, A few","The expression なん + counter + か in Japanese is a way of highlighting an uncertain number of something, and comes across similarly to 'some', 'several', or 'a few' in English. Literally, the meaning is much closer to 'what + counter + I wonder?', as it shows the speaker's uncertainty about the number. In addition to なん; いく, from the kanji 幾 (how many/much) may be used as part of this construction. While both are fairly common, 幾 is more common as part of set expressions, like 幾 ら (how much) and 幾 つ (how many/old), while なん is more common for counting specific things, like people. Both 何 and 幾 are regularly seen in plain hiragana and their kanji forms, so it is worth remembering both. Caution Despite having the same kanji as 何 , なん will almost always be used to count things, while なに will be used to identify things.",N4
な-,な-Adjective,exp,Describing a noun,"In Japanese, almost any type of word can be attached to the beginning of a noun to modify the meaning, or describe the qualities of that noun. However, depending on the type of word used, conjugation rules will differ slightly. For な-Adjectives , they will always need to be followed by な , when used before a noun. This means that adjective (A) is describing qualities/features of noun (B). Caution Many words can take either な or の when describing a noun. The difference in meaning is usually clear. Let's take a look at both nuances. (A) な (B) means that - (A) is a quality/feature of (B) (A) の (B) means that - (A) is the type/purpose of (B) To avoid making this mistake when using な-Adjectives to describe a noun, it can be helpful to think about whether you are describing a 'quality', or the 'purpose' of something.",N5
な-,な-Adjective,n,な-Adjective (Predicate),"A predicate is a word that describes the topic/subject of a sentence. The Japanese equivalent of this is a 述語 , which literally means 'statement word'. As a predicate , な-Adjectives can appear by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used at the end of a sentence. It is important to remember that all な-Adjectives can also function as nouns, and therefore tend to sound more like a noun than an adjective, when used as a predicate . When there are no other words apart from the adjective itself, it comes across similarly to 'It's pretty', or 'It's hated', and similar expressions in English. We just have to guess what the 'it' is from context. Caution Unlike い-Adjectives , な-Adjectives change form depending on where they are in the sentence. At the end of a sentence, they will always be followed by だ , or です (except in casual conversation where だ is omitted). However, when used before the word they are describing, they will always be followed by な . Hence the name な-Adjectives . In many sentences, either は or が could be used to mark the word/words that the predicate is describing. Which one sounds more natural will depend on many factors. In general, if you are specifically pointing out something as being different from other things in the same category, が will be used. In this example, が is distinguishing a specific station as having a unique level of dirtiness compared to others. は would sound unnatural in this type of sentence. Fun Fact Most な-Adjectives are words of foreign (Chinese/English) origin.",N5
な-,な-Adjectives,n,Adjectives that are also nouns,"In Japanese, the vast majority of な-Adjectives are originally nouns, and differ from nouns only in that they have their own set of conjugation rules. The dictionary form of a な-Adjective will always be followed by だ . な is only attached when describing another noun. As we can see from these examples, だ or です is required at the end of a sentence, but な will be required when using a な-Adjective to describe a noun. な-Adjectives are mostly words of foreign (Chinese/English) origin. This is why they have evolved to require unique conjugation rules. Fun Fact As a learner, it can be very difficult to identify what a な-Adjective is, compared to a regular noun. Nouns conjugate with の , while な-Adjectives conjugate with な. A very simple trick that Japanese children learn is using the adverb とても 'very'. If とても sounds natural with a word, then it is probably a な-Adjective , if it sounds unnatural, then the word is likely to be a regular noun. From this example, we can see that とても can be used to help identify な-Adjectives . Basically, this is due to adjectives being measurable 'very big', 'very small', while nouns are not measurable 'very dog', 'very boat'.",N5
な,な,prt,"Do not, Don't (Prohibitive)","な is classified as a sentence ending particle in Japanese. When attached to the base (dictionary) form of a verb, it has the nuance of strongly demanding that someone 'not' do something.",N5
に当たって,にあたり・にあたって,,"When, When doing something, On the occasion, At the time","に 当 たり or に 当 たって is a formal grammar pattern in Japanese used to convey the meaning of 'at the time of (A)', 'when doing (A)', or 'on the occasion of (A)'. Like に 際 して 'on the occasion of (A)', it will often be used in regard to preparation for future events. This structure is a combination of に, and the う-Verb 当 たる 'to hit', or 'to come into contact' in either its formal-conjunctive form or て-form. に 当 たり will appear following verbs in their dictionary form, or nouns. There are two primary nuances that this structure will be used for, so let's look at a few examples of each. The first is when (A) is some sort of special occasion or condition from which (B) will be done. The second is when (A) is some sort of goal or target for which (B) will be the means or measures in response to that goal. Caution Unlike に 際 して , which can be used for either positive or negative situations, に 当 たり will primarily only be used for positive or neutral situations.",N2
にあって,にあって,,"At, In the (place or situation), Under ~ conditions or circumstances, During, Suited to","にあって is a fairly formal grammar construction used in Japanese in the same way as its component parts. The particle に indicates a location, while あって is the て-form of the う-Verb ある 'to be'. As such, にあって can be and is often translated simply as 'in the situation of (A)', or 'under the conditions of (A)'. にあって will be used after a noun marking the condition, before the second clause will then go on to explain something remarkable or noteworthy about that situation or circumstance. Occasionally, にあって will be followed by も. This slightly alters the meaning and indicates that despite being in the noteworthy situation of (A), (B) is not being affected in the way that one would expect. Caution Be careful not to get にあって mixed up with the にあって used in sentences like 事故 にあって 'to meet with an accident'. This あって is a conjugation of 遭 う, 'to meet or happen upon (often something negative)', while the あって is this grammar point is simply the て-form of ある.",N1
に於いて,において・における,,"In, On, At, Regarding, In terms of","において is a combination of the case marking particle に in, and the 接続語 (conjunction) おいて. Either 於 いて, or 於 ける may be used, with no difference in meaning. において itself is usually translated as 'at', 'in', 'on', or 'regarding'. において (or における) will be used after nouns, or when connecting one noun to another. In the case of connecting one noun to another, における, or においての will be required. においての (and における ) are primarily used in formal language, and will not commonly be used in daily speech. Fun Fact 於 is quite an interesting kanji, and has a meaning similar to 'within the scope of'. Basically, it highlights all possible things that exist within a given topic/space. This is what enables the very broad range of meanings that においての and における may be used for.",N3
にかかっている,にかかっている,,To depend on,"にかかっている is a structure that may be translated as 'to depend on (A)', or 'to rest on (A)'. It is a combination of the case marking particle に, and the ている continuous form of 懸 かる 'to depend'. Although にかかっている may attach to nouns, it is also frequently seen following set structures such as かどうか 'whether or not', and か 否 か 'yes or no'. The に in にかかっている may sometimes be replaced with the adverb 如何 に 'how', 'in what way', or 'to what extent. In these situations, the meaning stays relatively the same, but will extend to 'depending on the way in which (A)', or 'depending on to what extent (A)'. Fun Fact 懸 かる is from the same family of verbs as 掛 かる, 架 かる, and 罹 る. These all have a similar meaning, but with a slightly different nuance. Japanese has many verbs like this that have the same reading, but with a nuance that changes based on the kanji. Due to kanji not always being used for many of these, it will be important to be able to recognize which nuance is being used in any given situation.",N1
に関わらず,にかかわらず,,"Regardless of, Whether or, No matter, With or without","In order to convey 'regardless of (A)', 'no matter if (A)', or 'with or without (A)', the expression に 関 わらず will often be used. This is a combination of に, the う-Verb 関 わる 'to be affected', 'to be influenced', and the literary auxiliary verb ず, which connects with verbs in the same way, and carries the same meaning as ない. This structure may be seen with verbs or adjectives in either their dictionary or negative forms, or with nouns in their dictionary form. Frequently the same word is repeated in both the positive and the negative, or grouped with かどうか in order to strengthen the 'whether (A) or not (A)' nuance. As the literal meaning of this structure is 'without being influenced by (A), (B)', or 'without being affected by (A), (B)', the primary nuance is on the fact that (B) is something that exists or will happen without consideration for (A). Due to this, に 関 わらず may also be used to show that 'any type of (A) will result in the same (B)'.",N2
に関わる,にかかわる,,"To relate to, To have to do with, Concerning, Depends on","When grouped with に, the う-Verb 関 わる 'to be concerned with' is frequently used to show a relation between (A) and (B). This grammar pattern may be translated as 'relating to (A), (B)', 'concerning (A), (B)', or '(B) that has to do with (A)'. This structure appears after nouns, and is occasionally followed directly to a second noun in order to modify its meaning. Also, it is most common to see this pattern in its non-kanji form. This grammar pattern may also highlight that (A) is something that the speaker should be cautious about, due to a potential negative outcome. Caution Despite being similar to に 関 する , にかかわる implies a deeper, more important relationship between (A) and (B), so they are not completely interchangeable.",N2
にかけては,にかけては,,"When it comes to, Regarding, Concerning","When に is combined with the て-form of the る-Verb 掛 ける 'to hang' or 'to suspend' and は, a common phrase meaning 'when it comes to (A), (B)', or 'regarding (A), (B)' is created. (A) にかけては (B) is used to express that within a certain field or domain, (B) is the best, or has a distinct advantage. This expression will be seen following a noun expressing the 'field' that is being discussed. Caution にかけては will always express a positive within (B). Due to this, it will be unnatural to use when highlighting a negative aspect or point. Caution Be careful not to confuse this grammar point with the にかけて that will appear primarily after nouns that indicate some sort of time-frame within which something occurs.",N2
に掛けて,にかけて,,"Over (a period), From ~ until, Through","Coming from the る - Verb 掛 ける 'to suspend', にかけて conveys that something is happening 'over a period of time', 'from (A) until (B)', or 'all through (A)'. This grammar structure is a combination of the case marking particle に , and 掛 ける combined with the conjunction particle て. Literally, the meaning can be thought of as follows: に - Marks (A) as the location/state. 掛 けて - States that something is 'suspended' (in an ongoing process) in that location/state. The 'something' that is an ongoing process will usually be indicated by a (B) part of the sentence. This expression will primarily be used with nouns. にかけて is primarily used in written language, although it appears quite often in the news as well, indicating that some weather pattern is expected to continue for a set period of time. Caution Occasionally, the adverbial particle は is used after にかけて. This transforms the meaning of 'all through (A)', to something similar to 'limited to within (A)'. Any (B) phrase in these types of sentences will be contrasting (B) with (A), rather than saying (B) is occurring within (A). As we can see by these examples, this is an extension of the standard use of は, which shows that everything before it is a 'set state'. Therefore '(A) は (B)', means that 'only (A) defines (A), (B) is a separate entity/discussion'.",N3
に託けて,にかこつけて,,"In the name of, Using the excuse of, To use as a pretext of, Under the guise or pretense of","に 託 けて is a structure based on the case-marking particle に, and the る-Verb 託 ける ‘to consign as’, or ‘to label as’. As this translation doesn’t exhibit the same nuance well in English all the time, it is commonly interpreted as ‘in the name of (A)’, or ‘under the pretense of (A)’. に 託 けて will be used after nouns, or verbs that have been nominalized with の. Caution Despite the common interpretations, the original meaning of ‘to consign’ works just as well in terms of meaning ‘labeling it as (A)’. This is due to に 託 けて being used primarily for criticism of surface-level excuses used to fulfill an ulterior motive.",N1
に気が付く,にきがつく,,"To notice (that), To realize (that)","に 気 が 付 く is a common expression that highlights when someone 'notices that (A)', or 'realizes that (A)'. 付 く 'to be attached' is the intransitive form of 付 ける 'to attach', meaning that it is something that happens by itself. The case marking particle に marks the 'location' to where your 気 (sometimes interpreted as 'attention') becomes attached. This structure may be used after nouns, or verbs that have been nominalized with either の , or こと . Fun Fact There are many different translations for 気 in English. These can range from 'spirit', to 'attention', to 'will', or even 'consciousness'. However, perhaps one of the most accurate ways to translate 気 , is 'presence of mind'. The 'location' to which your focus, attention, or perception is drawn, will always highlight your 気 .",N4
にくい,にくい,,"Difficult to, Hard to","Like 易 い , にくい is an い-Adjective that is regularly attached to the ます stem of verbs. However, instead of meaning 'easy to (A)', it means 'difficult to (A)'. (A) will always represent the verb that comes before にくい . The nuance of にくい is that (A) is a task that is difficult to do, because of the required skill level, or similar factors. This is different from づらい, which focuses more on a task that is difficult due to being unbearable/hard to endure for some reason. Fun Fact An easy way to remember the difference in nuance between にくい and づらい, is that にくい comes from the same kanji as 難 しい, which usually carries the meaning of 'difficulty' (in relation to skill being required).",N4
に従って,にしたがって,,"As, Following, As then, According to, In accordance with","By grouping the う-Verb 従 う 'to comply' with に, a common pattern meaning 'to comply with (A)', 'in accordance with (A)', or 'following (A)' will be created. This is a fairly strong and formal structure, indicating that (B) is being controlled or heavily influenced by (A). (B) will often express some kind of ongoing or sudden change caused by (A). に 従 って may appear after either verbs of nouns in their dictionary forms. As this expression is quite formal, it is common to see it used in relation to matters that are usually discussed in formal or official situations, such as laws, standards, conventions, or traditions.",N2
にしたところで,にしたところで,,"Even, Even for, Even from the perspective of, Even in the case of","にしたところで or としたところで are two expressions that are used to indicate the hypothetical situation of (A), from within which the result of (B) will not change. These structures primarily express a lack of power over the ultimate result, or a lack of significant difference between (A) and any other potential choice. Translations include 'even in the case of (A), (B)', or 'even for (A), (B)'. These structures combine either of the case-marking particles と or に with the past tense of する, した, the noun ところ, used for marking the situation, and the case marking particle で. It will directly follow nouns or noun-modified phrases. These patterns can be thought of more simply as a combination of にする 'going with (A)' or とする 'as (A)', and the たところで 'even if (A), not (B)' grammar structure that indicates negative outcomes. In casual situations, たところで will occasionally be replaced with たって.",N1
にしたら,にしたら,,From the point of view of,"When に is combined with the hypothetical forms of する (すれば, or したら), it forms a structure used in Japanese for conveying that the speaker is making an opinion about (A), from its point of view. This is frequently translated as 'from the point of view of (A)', or 'from the standpoint of (A)'. Literally, it means something close to 'if we go off (A)', and just highlights that the speaker is choosing a particular aspect of (A) to discuss as a possibility. In many cases, the (B) part of にしたら or にすれば expressions will be an opinion about what the speaker expects to be true for (A). にしたら and にすれば are structures that will be used after nouns that identify people or organizations, from which the speaker will then make an assumption about them/it. Although almost identical in meaning, にすれば will be the preferred choice in formal sentences. Caution - にしたら and にすれば are hypothetical grammar structures that make some sort of assumption about (A), they will not be used in regard to oneself, and one's own opinions. This can be thought of as a function of にする itself, in that you can't 'go off' yourself hypothetically, as you already are yourself, and already know your own thoughts.",N2
にしては(),にしては,,"(Even) considering, (Even) for","Like として , にして highlights an aspect of something from which another thing happens. The primary difference being that と implies that (B) results from (A), while に implies that (B) happens/exists at the same time as (A). This reflects the case marking particle に 's use as a location. The adverbial particle は presents the entire (A) phrase as something that will be compared. にしては is regularly translated as 'considering (A), (B)', or 'even for (A), (B)', and may be used with both verbs and nouns. Like として , にして is often considered as a stand-alone adverbial particle , despite stemming from several parts. Despite the 'considering (A), (B)' translation, にしては is closer in meaning to 'while (A), (B)'. This expresses that (A) and (B) share a simultaneous relation, but also that (B) is not necessarily a result of (A) at all.",N3
にして,にしてみれば,,"For (A), In the case of (A), From (A)'s point of view, In the eyes of (A)","にしてみれば , usually written completely in hiragana, is an expression used when the speaker is making a hypothetical statement about how something may appear from the point of view of another. It will often be translated as 'from the point of view of (A), (B)', 'in the case of (A), (B)', or simply 'for (A), (B)'. Literally, the meaning is 'assuming that I was (A) and then looking from there, (B)'. にしてみれば will appear after nouns that represent a person, or organizations representative of people. It is a combination of the case-marking particle に, the て-form of する, and the hypothetical form of 見 る, 見 れば. As にしてみれば will exclusively follow words that indicate a person or a group of people, the (B) part of the phrase will usually discuss how the speaker assumes that they would feel given the situation. Because of this assumption, these sentences often finish with だろう, でしょう, かもしれない, and other similar structures.",N1
にしても～にしても,にしても～にしても,,Regardless of whether,"にしても , a grammar point consisting of に, the て-form of する, and も, is used to convey that 'regardless of (A) or (B), the result will still be (C)', or '(C) is true, regardless of either (A) or (B)'. While it is common for this grammar pattern to appear with the positive and negated versions of a verb in (A) and (B), it may actually be used with any verbs, nouns, or adjectives that are contrasting in some way. In many cases, ～にしても , ～にしろ , and ～にせよ will be completely interchangable. However, the latter ～にしろ and にせよ are more direct, so will be seen less in formal situations.",N2
にしても,にしても,,"Even though, Even if, Even when, Also","In the same way that にしては highlights a point to be considered about (A), or simply 'while (A)', the replacement of は with the adverbial particle も will put further emphasis on (B) being a surprising or unexpected thing that accompanies (A). This continues to reflect the case marking particle に 's use as a location. にしても may be translated as 'even considering (A), (B)', or 'even while (A), (B)', and may be used with any word in its plain form . にして by itself is often considered as a stand-alone adverbial particle , despite stemming from several parts. にしても is very regularly used with Japanese's equivalent of WH-words, like どこ, どの, だれ, なに, etc. In these cases, it highlights that 'even considering (A) is undetermined (in location, number, amount, etc), (B)'. Caution As opposed to としても , a grammar point that will be covered in another lesson, にしても may introduce new topics ( としても may not). This is due to にしても implying that (A) and (B) exist simultaneously, without the need for (B) to necessarily stem from (A). However, としても will always imply that (B) stems from (A) in some way.",N3
にして,にして①,,"At, Over, In, Only (after, when, or because)","When the case-marking particle に is combined with the て-form of する, it often carries the meaning of 'at (A)', 'over (A)', or 'only when (A)'. This nuance is used when (A) is something that is a fairly high level, or some point that would be considered a prime example for any given topic. にして may appear following counters, or standard nouns. While にして marks (A) as some particular exemplar, what follows may either be something that is or is not considered befitting of that example. In this way, (B) generally describes something that either does or does not fulfill the expectations of (A), and perhaps why. It is common to see にして followed by grammar patterns such as ようやく 'finally', or 初 めて 'only when'. These function to emphasize にして even further as being a point from which something is achieved or attained. Fun Fact Just like other structures that make use of the various conjugations of にする, にして indicates something that has been decided upon, or is being accepted as a fact from which a new condition will arise, or has arisen.",N1
にして,にして②,,"To be ~ and ~, To be ~ as well as ~, Both ~ and ~","Occasionally, the combination of the case-marking particle に 'in', and the て-form of the special verb する, して will be considered as a compound particle . While this does not change the way it will be used, it puts more emphasis on the 'going from that (A), (B)' nuance of にして . This will be translated as '(A) as well as (B)', 'both (A) and (B)', or 'to be (A) and (B)'. This use of にして will appear following either nouns or な-Adjectives. Some set expressions like 幸 いにして and 不幸 にして also exist. These can be interpreted as 'fortunately' and 'unfortunately' respectively. Caution Like with 幸 いにして and 不幸 にして , にして tends to be used with a fairly limited set of words when having the meaning of 'both (A) and (B)'. Due to this, it is best to only use patterns that you have come across before. Fun Fact The tense at the end of にして sentences often changes the way that it will be understood, but it is important to remember that all にして structures simply put emphasis on (A) as being what allowed (B), led to (B), or exists in precedence to (B).",N1
にしろ〜にしろ…,にしろ～にしろ,,Whether… or,"にせよ , and にしろ are two phrases that are often translated as 'even if (A)', or 'no matter if (A)'. This structure is a combination of に, and either of the imperative forms of する; せよ, or しろ. せよ tends to be more common in written material, while しろ is more common in speech. Despite the English translations, this particular use of the imperative form of する translates more accurately to 'so it's (A), who cares!', as the speaker is just strongly stating that the actual condition of (A) is unimportant in the overall sentence. When repeated, にせよ～にせよ illustrates that regardless of either '(A) or (B), (C) is still true'. In many cases, (A) and (B) will only be a small sample of possibilities, with the actual meaning being 'in (A), (B), or any similar situation at all, (C) is still true'. にせよ and にしろ may appear following verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns in any of their standard forms. Caution Although not grammatically incorrect, it is quite unnatural to mix the use of にしろ with にせよ . Due to this, when using this pattern, it will be important to repeat the same exact expression. Fun-fact にせよ～にせよ is regularly used with pairs of antonyms. In a broad sense, this just illustrates that 'for the opposites of (A), (B), and everything between, (C)'.",N2
に過ぎない,にすぎない,,"No more than, Just, Merely","にすぎない is a common structure in Japanese used for indicating that something is 'no more than (A)', or 'merely (A)'. This expression is constructed from に, and the negated form of the る-Verb 過 ぎる, meaning 'to exceed', or 'to be more than'. Due to this, the literal translation of 'to not be more than (A)' reflects the English interpretations closely. にすぎない is slightly formal, but is heard fairly often in day-to-day speech as well. This grammar pattern may be used after verbs in any of their standard forms, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns. にすぎない is often seen paired with structures that will emphasize the phrase even further, such as ただ 'merely' or だけ 'just'. In the case of だけ, it will come between the target word and にすぎない. Also, standard conjugation rules will need to be remembered, such as adding な after a な-Adjective before だけ. Fun-fact にすぎない may occasionally appear in set phrases, such as 氷山 の 一角 にすぎない , which means 'to merely be the tip of the iceberg'.",N2
にする,～にする・～くする,,"Adjective + する, To make something/someone (more)","When combined with a な-Adjective , にする (or くする in the case of い-Adjectives ) carries the meaning of 'to make more (A)'. Just like the にする grammar point that is used for highlighting decisions, this にする construction implies that the speaker has a high level of control over the action. Basically, this changes the adjective into an adverb, and then uses する to show that the adjective itself is the thing that is being done. Fun Fact にする is one of four regularly repeating grammar patterns in Japanese that highlight the level of control that the speaker has over the action/result of an action. From highest to lowest level of control, these are as follows: にする - High level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action themselves. になる - High level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action themselves, but there is no external target. とする - Medium level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action, but some outside factors may need to be considered (difficulty, other people, time, etc.). となる - Low level of control, the speaker/subject has almost no control over these actions, and something that came about purely due to external factors is being discussed.",N4
くする,～にする・～くする,,"Adjective + する, To make something/someone (more)","When combined with a な-Adjective , にする (or くする in the case of い-Adjectives ) carries the meaning of 'to make more (A)'. Just like the にする grammar point that is used for highlighting decisions, this にする construction implies that the speaker has a high level of control over the action. Basically, this changes the adjective into an adverb, and then uses する to show that the adjective itself is the thing that is being done. Fun Fact にする is one of four regularly repeating grammar patterns in Japanese that highlight the level of control that the speaker has over the action/result of an action. From highest to lowest level of control, these are as follows: にする - High level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action themselves. になる - High level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action themselves, but there is no external target. とする - Medium level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action, but some outside factors may need to be considered (difficulty, other people, time, etc.). となる - Low level of control, the speaker/subject has almost no control over these actions, and something that came about purely due to external factors is being discussed.",N4
にする,にする,exp,"To decide on, To choose, To make something into, To view something as","にする is a structure that combines the に particle (a location/target), with the verb する . It means to 'make/decide' something in a certain way. The nuance with にする is that the speaker has direct control over the outcome. This is where the strong feeling of 'choice' comes from. The noun that comes before にする is the thing that is being decided. In this example, although the common translation is 'to decide', it is actually much closer to the slang expression 'to do (A)' in English. This means that the literal translation is actually 'I'll do a beer', or 'I'll make it a beer'. Sometimes the particle と is used instead of に. Although this has the same meaning, it changes the nuance slightly. When と is used, it takes away the feeling of being a direct decision. とする tends to be used in more formal situations, but this is only because と is less 'definite', so results in the phrase sounding less pushy. If you were going to compare these two to an English equivalent, it would be similar to the difference between the following sentences. に - I'll buy a burger. (A burger is the direct target of 'buy') と - I'll go with a burger. (You aren't 'going' anywhere, it just sounds softer) This grammar point may be used for more abstract nouns, and does not specifically need to be 'items'.",N5
にせよ,にせよ・にしろ,,"Even if, Even though, No matter, Whether… or","にせよ , and にしろ are two phrases that are often translated as 'even if (A)', or 'no matter if (A)'. This structure is a combination of に, and either of the imperative forms of する; せよ, or しろ. せよ tends to be more common in written material, while しろ is more common in speech. Despite the English translations, this particular use of the imperative form of する translates more accurately to 'so it's (A), who cares!', as the speaker is just strongly stating that the actual condition of (A) is unimportant in relation to what they actually want to say. にせよ and にしろ can appear following verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns in any of their standard forms. As this structure is fairly direct, in most cases it will be used as a way to emphasize that regardless of what the case is for (A), (B) is still true, or is the more important matter to consider.",N2
について,について,,"Concerning, About, Regarding","について is a combination of the case marking particle に , the verb う - Verb 就 く 'to assume a position', and the conjunction particle て. It is most often translated as 'about (A)', or 'concerning (A)', with the literal translation being closer to 'taking the position of (A)', or 'assuming the topic of (A)'. について may be used after nouns, or noun-phrases (phrases that use こと, の, etc). について may also appear before の + noun. In this use, it means '(A) that is about (B)'. Caution It is rare to see について actually using the kanji 就 . について itself is regularly considered as a single compound word , rather than a combination of its parts.",N3
に就き,につき,,"Due to, On account of, Each or every","Although rarely seen in its kanji form, につき is a grammar pattern that comes from a combination of に and the conjunctive form of the う- Verb 就 く 'to take up (A)', or 'to assume (A)'. This meaning is usually in regard to assuming a new position, such as a new job. However, the particular meaning conveyed here will be closer to 'due to (A), (B)', 'on account of (A), (B)', or 'for each (A), (B)'. につき will follow nouns directly, before the (B) part of the sentence describes what is happening 'due to' or 'on account of (A)'. This grammar point is quite formal, so it is often seen in formal documents, announcements, and notifications. Regardless of the several common English translations, the base meaning of 'to affix to (A)' is kept in all of the uses of につき , as it simply implies that (B) is in answer to, exists in a way that is directly linked to, suitable for, or caused by (A).",N2
に付け,につけ,,"Whenever, Every time something happens","In a similar way to につき , につけ implies that there is a something that is 'affixed' to the event or occasion of (A). However, unlike に 就 き this structure is a combination of に and the conjunctive form of the る-Verb 付 ける 'to affix', or 'to adhere'. When using につけ , the most common translation will be that something is happening 'every (A)', or 'whenever (A)'. In the (B) part of the sentence, the thoughts or feelings of the speaker will often be expressed in relation to (A). Additionally, (B) will always be something that is thought to happen naturally due to (A). This structure may appear with either verbs or nouns in their dictionary forms. It is also possible to see につけて , but the abbreviated form is far more common. Caution This is considered a fairly old-fashioned grammar structure, so will mostly only be seen in literature or shows that are emphasizing a specific time period.",N2
に連れて…,につれて,,"As…then, In proportion to, (Along) with","につれて , or に 連 れて when using kanji, is an expression that may be translated as 'as (A), then (B)', or 'in proportion to (A), (B)'. It is formed through the use of the case marking particle に , the る - Verb 連 れる 'to take along', and the conjunction particle て. Literally, the translation is similar to 'being taken along with (A), (B)', or 'in tow with (A), (B)'. につれて will be used after the plain, non-past form of verbs, or nouns. As 連 れる is a transitive verb, (A) につれて (B) implies that (A) is causing (B) to happen simultaneously. This does not have to be something that (A) is purposely doing (although it may be), just a 'domino' type effect, where (A) is considered the instigator.",N3
にて,にて,,"In, At, With, Using, By","にて is often considered as its own stand-alone particle, despite originally being a mix of に, and the conjunction particle, て. When combined, にて becomes a formal case-marking particle that is used in the same way as で. This means that it can convey the meaning of 'with (A)', 'by (A)', 'at (A)', or 'using (A)'. にて will primarily appear following nouns that illustrate a means, method, time, location, reason, or origin that the speaker wants to highlight. As this grammar structure is formal, it will primarily be seen in writing, or heard in announcements. で will be the far more natural choice in casual conversation.",N2
に止まらず,にとどまらず,,"Not limited to, Not only...but also, Not stopping at","にとどまらず is a formal structure that pairs the case marking particle に, the う-Verb 止 まる 'to remain', or 'to be limited to', and the classical auxiliary verb ず 'not'. にとどまらず is generally translated as 'not limited to (A)', or 'not stopping at (A)', and follows words indicating an extent, before going on to explain how something spreads beyond (A). にとどまらず will be seen following either nouns, or verbs in their dictionary form . This expression may be used to highlight either positive or negative effects. Caution にとどまらず will only be used when (B) is something that is expanding outward from the pre-existing boundaries of (A). This means that (B) will not be something that isn't directly tied to (A) somehow.",N1
になる,～になる・～くなる,exp,To become (Adjective),"になる (with な-Adjectives ), or くなる (with い-Adjectives ) is an expression used in Japanese to show that something is 'becoming (A)'. It can be used with any form of なる , to highlight that something will become (non-past), is becoming (continuous), or has become (past). It can even be used with negative forms, to show that something 'will not become (A)'. In the example with the tea getting cold, we can see how ている sometimes highlights something that exists in an ongoing state, rather than changing any further. In other words, 'the tea has gotten cold, and remains to be cold'. Additionally, the adjective いい 'good' is an exception to the regular conjugation rules for い-Adjectives , and will conjugate as よくなる, not いくなる.",N5

には及ばない,には及ばない②,,"To be no match (for), To not compare (with), To fall short (of), To not reach, Cannot win with, To be out of reach (for), To not be on par (with)","As mentioned in the には 及 ばない grammar point lesson as a polite expression, には 及 ばない may simply show the extent of something. This is usually when a comparison is being made between two things. This pattern is a combination of the case-marking marking particle に, the adverbial particle は, and the negated form of the う-Verb 及 ぶ 'to reach', 及 ばない. The literal translation is 'it does not extend to (A)'. This nuance of the phrase will appear after nouns. In this comparative use, the structure may also be translated as 'to be no match for (A)', 'to fall short of (A)', 'to not be on par with (A)'. には 及 ばない will be used most frequently when (A) is something that is being given extremely high praise. As such, set combinations like (A) の 足元 には 及 ばない 'to not even reach the feet of (A)' will often be seen.",N1
には及ばない,には及ばない①,,"There is no need to, It is fine if you don’t, Unnecessary","には 及 ばない is a polite expression in Japanese used in order to indicate that there is 'no need to (A)', or that '(A) is unnecessary. It is a combination of the case-marking marking particle に, the adverbial particle は, and the negated form of the う-Verb 及 ぶ 'to reach', 及 ばない. The literal translation is 'it does not extend to (A)'. This phrase will appear after nouns, or verbs in their dictionary form . As this grammar pattern is used in polite speech , the word that it is attached to is often preceded by either お or ご, depending on what type of verb it is. Caution When not used as a polite expression, には 及 ばない may simply show the extent of something. This is usually when a comparison is being made between two things. This use will be translated as '(A) does not reach the extent of (B)', or '(A) cannot be compared to (B)'.",N1
には当たらない,には当たらない,,"No need to/for, Cannot, Not worth it to, Not suitable","には 当 たらない is a somewhat formal pattern used in Japanese for indicating that something is 'not worth (A)', or that there is 'no need to (A)'. This is a combination of the case marking particle に, the adverbial particle は, and the negative form of the う-Verb 当 たる 'to strike', or 'to be on the mark', 当 たらない. Due to this, the literal meaning can be thought of as 'it's not on the mark to (A)'. には 当 たらない will appear directly after verbs in their dictionary form , or する verbs either with or without the する. Additionally, the は may occasionally be omitted, without any change in meaning. Rather than implying that something is 'way off', には 当 たらない most often simply highlights that a particular situation is not to the extent where (A) would be appropriate. (A) itself is regularly a verb that relates to reactions or feelings. Some examples include 驚 く 'to be surprised', 非難 'to reproach', 称賛 'to admire', 感心 'to be impressed', 喜 ぶ 'to rejoice', and other similar words.",N1
には,には,,"In order to, In regard to, For","には is a common particle combination in Japanese that is used to express contrast in regard to the topic. As a function of the particles that combine to make には , に highlights that something is 'for (A)', while は emphasizes that a generalization or contrast is being made about (A). Common translations for には include 'in order to', 'in regard to', or 'for'. This structure will appear following either verbs in their dictionary form, or nouns. Fun-fact Despite having several different translations, には can almost always be thought of as simply meaning 'for', as に highlights that (A) is the 'target', while は shows that whatever  happens in (B) is specific to (A), regardless of whatever might be true for another topic.",N2
に引き換え,にひきかえ,,"In stark contrast, In comparison, On the other hand, While, In sharp contrast","に 引 き 換 え is a grammar pattern that is used for making contrasts between things, and will be translated as ‘in comparison to (A), (B)’, or ‘in stark contrast to (A), (B)’. The literal translation is ‘pulling back and switching away from (A), (B)’. This ‘switching away from’ portion may be used as a reminder of the large size of the difference that this grammar pattern usually indicates. に 引 き 換 え is a combination of the case-marking particle に, the conjunctive form of the う-Verb 引 く ‘to pull’, 引 き, and the conjunctive form of the る-Verb 換 える ‘to switch between’, or ‘to interchange’, 換 え. に 引 き 換 え may follow almost any type of word, but will require a の to precede it before い-Adjectives or verbs, and なの to precede it before な-Adjectives. (A) and (B) will always be two opposite ends of some kind of spectrum, where one is considered to be good, while the other is regarded as bad based on the subjective opinion of the speaker. Additionally, それにひきかえ may be used to begin sentences where the comparison is being made to a previous statement. Caution Both (A) and (B) will be facts that are plainly observable or measurable. Due to this, に 引 き 換 え will not be used in sentences that make assumptions or guesses.",N1
に他ならない,にほかならない,,"Nothing but, None other than, Simply","に 他 ならない is a grammar pattern used with nouns to indicate that something is 'definitely (A)', or 'nothing but (A)'. Other common translations are 'none other than (A)', or 'simply (A)'. This expression is often used to emphasize statements, reasons, or causes. Being a combination of the noun 他 'other' and the negated form of the う-Verb なる 'to become'. This phrase literally just states that (A) will not become anything other than what it is, as the given definition is already the most accurate. Caution In formal situations, particularly formal writing, に 他 ならぬ may also sometimes be seen.",N2
に纏わる,にまつわる,,"Surrounding, Related or relating to, Associated with, Connected to","Making use of the う-Verb まつわる 'to coil around', にまつわる is a formal grammar pattern that follows nouns and expresses that something broadly discusses the topic of (A). It is usually translated as 'surrounding (A)', 'associated with (A)', or 'connected to (A)'. In most cases, まつわる will be both preceded and followed by a noun, with the preceding noun being the topic, and the following noun being the thing that is dealing with that topic. まつわる itself is primarily seen when (B) is some sort of information or explanation related to (A). Because of this, 話 'tale', 物語 'story', 伝説 'legend', 神話 'myth', and similar words will often appear as (B). Fun Fact 纏 わる shares the same kanji as 纏 まる, another common verb that means 'to come together', or 'to consolidate'. Although the kanji itself is rarely used outside of books, it may help to remember the nuance being conveyed in まつわる of 'coming together'. This 'coming together around (A)', or simply 'surrounding (A)' translates the feeling of the structure quite accurately.",N1
に見える,にみえる,,"To look, To seem, To appear","にみえる (primarily written only in hiragana) is a phrase that combines the case marking particle に , with the る-Verb 見 える 'to appear', or 'to be visible'. This construction is regularly used with nouns, to show that something 'appears to be (A)', but it may also be partnered with the auxiliary verbs ようだ or そうだ (in their adverbial forms ように and そうに ) to add a level of uncertainty. In these cases, it sounds closer to 'to seem to be (A)' in English. As with many other ようだ structures, みたい may be used instead. This creates the expression みたい にみえる . While this may appear confusing at first, it just means 'to look like something that could be (A)'. In this way it reinforces the 'guess' that the speaker is making. Caution In grammar constructions like this, kanji will very rarely be used. This is primarily because it will change the way a native speaker perceives the meaning. Many grammar structures are written purely in hiragana, specifically to express that they are a 'set' construction. Adding kanji can lead a reader to assume that the writer is highlighting the kanji's meaning, rather than the more common grammatical meaning.",N4
にも拘わらず,にもかかわらず,,"Despite, In spite of, Regardless, Nevertheless","にもかかわらず is a formal grammar structure in Japanese used to convey that something is 'in spite of (A)', or 'despite (A)'. This pattern is a combination of に, も, the う-Verb 拘 わる 'to fixate on', or 'to stick to', and the literary auxiliary verb ず, which connects with verbs in the same way, and carries the same meaning as ない. This structure is most frequently seen connected to verbs, い-Adjectives and nouns in their standard forms. In most cases, this pattern will appear without kanji. Literally, this phrase can be thought of as expressing 'without being affected by (A), (B)', or 'without fixating on (A), (B)'. However, it is almost always used in exactly the same way as のに 'despite'. Caution It is important not to get にも 拘 わらず mixed up with に 関 わらず. The former expresses 'despite', while the latter tends to be used more often for 'no matter if'.",N2
に基づいて,にもとづいて,,"Based on, In accordance with","In order to say that one thing is 'based on' another in Japanese, the expression に 基 づいて will be used. This is a combination of the case marking particle に, the う - Verb, 基 づく 'to originate from', and the conjunction particle て. This expression regularly highlights some kind of judgement/conclusion that the speaker has made, using (A) as their base. To use に 基 づいて , put the noun (or noun phrase) that you would like to identify as a 'basis' before に 基 づいて , and then express your judgment/conclusion in part (B) of the sentence. Alternatively, the past form of 基 づく may be used when connected directly to a second noun. (A) に 基 づいた (B) directly expresses that (B) is based on (A). Fun Fact The kanji 基 is fairly accurately translated as 'foundation', and is regularly used to highlight things that 'stem' from something. Due to this, に 基 づいて may also be used to identify things that are 'produced from (A)', 'created from (A)', or 'invented based on (A)'.",N3
にも程がある,にもほどがある,,"There is a limit to, You are too ..., How …!, How … one can be!","にも 程 がある is an expression that will often be used fairly critically in order to state that something is too much, based on the speaker's personal opinion. Common translations include 'how (A) can one be', 'there is a limit to (A)', or 'you are too (A)'. Being that it is composed of the case-marking particle に, adverbial particle も, the noun 程 'bounds', and がある 'to have', the more literal meaning of 'there are bounds even within (A)' also carries the critical nuance of the more standard translations. This structure may follow almost any word type in their standard form s. Caution Despite being used negatively in the vast majority of situations, there are instances where にも 程 がある will be used positively with adjectives such as かわいい 'cute' or うまい 'delicious'. In sentences like this, the grammar structure is being used jokingly to express admiration or approval.",N1
にもまして,にもまして,,"Even -er than, Even more than, More than anything, More than anybody, More than ever","にもまして is a structure used to imply that something has surpassed a certain point, and will be used particularly when that thing was at a consistent level in the past, but has now risen. Common translations include 'more than ever, (B)', or 'even more than (A), (B)'. にもまして is simply a combination of the case-marking particle に, the adverbial particle も 'even', and the て-form of the う-Verb 増 す 'to increase'. The に will be attached to a noun which it is marking as the comparison point from which 増 す indicates an increase or growth. This means that the literal translation is simply 'even increasing from (A), (B)'. This pattern will regularly follow words like 誰 'who', 何 'what', or いつ 'when'. In these cases, (A) is just being expressed as 'anyone', 'anything', or 'ever', rather than something more specific.",N1
う,にも～ない,,"Cannot... even if one wants or tries, Would like but cannot, Wants or tries but cannot","When combined with either of the auxiliary verbs of volition, う or よう, にも～ない conveys that 'despite wanting to (A), it can't be done'. There are usually some circumstances as to why (A) cannot be done that are beyond the control of the speaker. The same verb will be repeated in both the volitional form and the negated potential form. This means that the literal meaning of this grammar pattern is 'Even if I went to (A), I can't (A)'. This 'went to' implies the 'attempt' or 'will' on behalf of the speaker. Caution As opposed to the similar に～ない grammar point that pairs with verbs in dictionary form , ようにも～ない tends to refer more to physical reasons for why something cannot be done. に～ない on the other hand is often used to illustrate mental limitations.",N1
よう,にも～ない,,"Cannot... even if one wants or tries, Would like but cannot, Wants or tries but cannot","When combined with either of the auxiliary verbs of volition, う or よう, にも～ない conveys that 'despite wanting to (A), it can't be done'. There are usually some circumstances as to why (A) cannot be done that are beyond the control of the speaker. The same verb will be repeated in both the volitional form and the negated potential form. This means that the literal meaning of this grammar pattern is 'Even if I went to (A), I can't (A)'. This 'went to' implies the 'attempt' or 'will' on behalf of the speaker. Caution As opposed to the similar に～ない grammar point that pairs with verbs in dictionary form , ようにも～ない tends to refer more to physical reasons for why something cannot be done. に～ない on the other hand is often used to illustrate mental limitations.",N1
による,によって・による,,"By means of, According to, Depending on, Because of, Due to","によって , による , and により are all different versions of the same expression, that can basically be translated as 'according to (A)', or 'depending on (A)'. This uses the same よる as seen in the grammar pattern によると . They will be used in the following way: によって - Generally used before a comma (although not always). Acts as the separation point between the (A) and (B) parts of a sentence. Made up of the case marking particle に , and the う - Verb よる in its て form. による - Generally used at the end of a sentence, to highlight that the previous statement depends on (A). により - Almost always used before a comma. Acts as the separation point between the (A) and (B) parts of a sentence. Made up of the case marking particle に , and the う - Verb よる in its conjunctive form . To use any of these constructions, attach them to the end of a noun that you want to express as being the 'dependent' thing. Caution による may also sometimes be followed by a noun. In these cases, it will become a verb modified noun, and highlight that (B) resulted from (A). Fun Fact Although よる is almost always written in hiragana, there are several different kanji that use this reading. They all share similar meanings. Learn more about this in the によると grammar point.",N3
によると,によると・によれば,,According to,"によると , a combination of the case marking particle に , the う - Verb よる, and the conjunction particle と, is a phrase that is used to express that something is 'according to (A)', or 'going off (A)'. In these cases, (A) is considered to be the source of some form of information which will be conveyed in the (B) part of the sentence. This expression will be used after nouns, or with verbs that have been paired with ところ (to indicate the 'place' where the information came from). In newspapers and in articles, the more formal によりますと variant can also regularly be seen. However, this structure is not limited to using と, and the same meaning can be conveyed with with によれば . This is just よる in its conjunctive form that pairs with the conjunction particle ば . Caution Although によると and によれば are largely interchangeable, によると will convey a higher level of 'certainty', or 'reliability' in regard to the source of information. Due to this, によると is more likely to be used when referring to legitimate sources (police, news, etc). Fun Fact よる is almost always written in hiragana alone. However, there are several different kanji that can be used to represent this verb. Each of these kanji have slightly different nuances, but they generally all represent the same 'base' meaning. This meaning is that '(B)'s foundation is (A)'. The most common kanji used for よる are as follows: 依 る - (B) depends on (A). 拠 る - (B) extends from (A). 因 る - (B) results from (A). 由 る - (B) is due to (A).",N3
に渡って,にわたって,,"Across, Throughout, Extends, Over (a period of time or range)","Partnered with the case marking particle に, the う-Verb 渡 る 'to cross' in its て-form highlights a span of something in regard to breadth, size, or time. This structure is often translated as either 'across (A)', 'throughout (A)', 'extending through (A)', or 'over the period of (A)'. Like other verb structures that pair with nouns, the standard form may also be used when paired with a second noun, in order to modify that noun. Coming from the meaning of 渡 る 'to cross', this grammar pattern always expresses that something is either happening or exists 'all across (A)', or 'from the start to the finish'. Additionally, に 渡 って is considered quite formal, so will often be seen in articles or on the news. Caution As 渡 る indicates a span of something that is being crossed, the 'span' must always be indicated clearly.",N2
に代わって,に代わって,,"In place of, On behalf of, To succeed","に 代 わって is an expression that will only appear with nouns, conveying that (B) is doing something 'in place of (A)', or 'on behalf of (A)'. This is a combination of the case marking particle に , the う - Verb 代 わる 'to substitute', and the conjunction particle て. に代わり may also be used, as this is the formal conjunctive. Also known as the conjunctive form . Fun Fact In this construction, に is acting as a location marker, rather than specifically meaning 'for (A)'. What this means is that に 代 わる is the act of removing (A) from its place, and exchanging it for (B). This is why に 代 わって may also be used in the meaning of 'to succeed', or 'to replace', as switching (A) to (B) may be permanent.",N3
に伴って,に伴って・に伴い,,"As, Due,  Along with, Hand-in-hand with, Resulted in, Be consequent upon","When the う-Verb 伴 う 'to accompany' in its て-form is used with に and attached to the end of nouns or verbs in their dictionary forms, it is regularly translated as 'due to (A), (B)', 'hand in hand with (A), (B)', or 'along with (A), (B)'. In all of these meanings, the base interpretation of 'to accompany' is being highlighted. As 'accompanying' does not specifically indicate that (A) is controlling (B), this grammar structure may be used simply to indicate things that happen at the same time, rather than when something is being directly caused by the first. However, (A) having a strong influence on the change of (B) is usually implied. に 伴 う may also appear directly before another noun when it is being modified by the verb. に 伴 って is used both for events that are progressively changing at the same time, and momentary events that cause a sudden change.",N2
に先立ち,に先立ち,,"Before, Prior to, In preference over","Being a combination of に and the う-Verb 先立 つ 'to take the lead', or 'to precede', this structure connects to both nouns and verbs in their dictionary forms, to indicate that (B) is a preliminary step required for (A). It may be interpreted as 'before (A), (B)', 'prior to (A), (B)', or 'in preference over (A), (B)'. Despite these several interpretations, the literal meaning of 'standing before (A), (B)' can be useful to remember, as it highlights the importance of (B) as a first step. As 先立 つ is a verb, it may be seen in its dictionary from when followed directly by another noun, or in its て-form when indicating the whole (B) phrase as preceding (A). Additionally, the formal-conjunctive form, 先立 ち will often be used in preference of the て-form, as に 先立 つ is a formal grammar structure. Fun-fact 先立 つ may often be seen paired with 物 , and is a set expression in these cases that translates similarly to 'means' in English. This 'means' refers to the prerequisites required to enable something, and will usually appear in negative sentences, in order to show that one 'does not have the means to do (A)'.",N2
に先駆けて,に先駆けて,,"First, Prior to, Pioneer, Ahead of","に 先駆 け , is an expression used after nouns which indicates that something is being done ‘ahead of (A)’, or in a way that ‘paves the way for (A)’. It is a combination of the case-marking particle に, and the conjunctive form of the る-verb 先駆 ける, meaning ‘to lead the attack’, or ‘to pioneer’. In most cases, 先駆 け will imply that one person or organization did something first, which then led to everyone else within the same category taking the same course of action. Common translations include ‘prior to (A), (B)’, or ‘ahead of (A), (B)’. Occasionally, the conjunction particle て may be used after the base 先駆 け form. As this grammar structure often indicates whole bodies that took a similar action after (B), に 先駆 け will usually be seen after words like 世界 ‘the world’, 全国 ‘the whole country’, 全市 ‘the whole city’ or ‘every city’, 業界 ‘the industry’, 他社 ‘other companies’, or 他 ◯ ‘or anything’.",N1
に則って,に則って・に則り,,"According to, In accordance with, Based on, In line with","に 則 って is a formal expression used when something is being done 'according to (A)', or 'in line with (A)'. This is usually some basis, foundation, or standard which has a long running history. The case-marking particle に is being combined with the て-form of the う-Verb 則 る 'to follow along with' in this grammar pattern. Based on this, the literal meaning is just that (B) is something that follows along with (A). While several forms may be seen, the most common are a noun followed by にのっとって , or a noun followed by にのっとった which will then modify a second noun. Both the kanji form and the plain hiragana form are quite common, so it will be helpful to remember both. As (A) is generally considered to be something that has some kind of foundation. It will mostly represent a thing that has some kind of inception point from which point little, if anything, changed. Some examples are laws, traditions, standards, codes of conduct, etc.",N1
に加えて,に加えて,,"Not only...but also, In addition, Not to mention","にくわえて is a formal grammar pattern in Japanese that is a combination of に, and the て-form of the る-Verb 加 える 'to add', or 'to append'. Often, this structure will be translated as 'in addition to (A), (B)', or 'not only (A), but also (B). Being that it is a formal phrase, に 加 えて will also often appear in its formal-conjunctive form に 加 え . To use にくわえて , simply place it directly after the noun that you would like to highlight as being the base information, before discussing what exactly is 'in addition' to that base in the following clause. Both the kanji and hiragana forms of this structure are fairly common, so it will be beneficial to remember both. Caution にくわえて is frequently used when (B) is something that is in addition to (A) in respect to magnifying what was already true of (A). This just means that it will often be used to highlight something being brought about by (B) that would not be possible with just (A) by itself. This increase may be either positive or negative.",N2
に即して,に即して,,"In line with, Based on, In accordance with","に 即 して is a formal grammar structure which is used to express that something is being done for the purpose of handling a matter in the best possible way. It is a combination of に, and the する-verb 即 する 'in corcordance with (A)', ' in line with (A)' in its て-form. Occasionally, に 則 して 'in following with' will be used instead. This structure will be used before nouns, or may be used when one noun is directly modifying another. In the case of the latter, に 即 した will be used instead of に 即 して . Caution に 即 して is used when things are being done based on circumstances or situations, while に 則 して tends to be used when something is being done in accordance with laws, policies, or standards. There are situations where に 則 して will be incorrect, so に 即 して is often used in both cases in recent years.",N1
に反して,に反して,,"Go against, Contrary to","に 反 して , a combination of に and the て-form of 反 する 'to oppose', or 'to go against', is a construction in Japanese that is used to present counter opinions or arguments in relation to the previous statement. Common translations include 'contrary to (A), (B)', and 'going against (A), (B)'. に 反 して will appear after nouns, before expressing some opposing or contrasting point. Alternatively, に 反 する may be used when directly modifying the following noun. Unlike に 対 して , に 反 して will often be used when a prediction does not match the actual reality of a situation. に 反 して is a fairly formal grammar pattern, so will be found mostly in literature, official documents, or speeches.",N2
にとって,に取って,,"To, For, Concerning","にとって (or に 取 って when appearing as kanji) is a structure in Japanese that is used to convey opinions, or just generally to discuss something from a particular perspective. This expression regularly appears after names/pronouns, but may also be used with regular nouns. にとって is often translated as 'to (A)', 'for (A)', or 'concerning (A)'. However, it is used in almost exactly the same way as から 見 て 'from the perspective of (A)'. To use にとって, simply attach it to the end of a noun (or noun phrase) that you would like to express a certain viewpoint, judgment, or opinion from. Fun Fact にとって comes from the verb 取 る 'to take'. In this way, it literally means 'to take up (A)', where (A) is the location (standpoint) being highlighted with the case marking particle に. Broadly, にとって has two main uses, these are as follows: の 身 として - From (A)'s standpoint. (When used about people) の 立場 から 見 て - When looking at it from (A). (When used about things)",N3
に合わせて,に合わせて・に合った,,"In accordance with, Matching, Fitting, Suitable for, Adjust or tune to","When the る - Verb 合 わせる (sometimes 併 せる) is seen in the form 合 わせて, it conveys that something has been made to 'match (A)' or 'fit with (A)'. (A) being a noun that appears before に , followed by 合 わせて. This structure can also have the nuance of 'in accordance with (A)', highlighting that (A) is the governing factor. It is also possible to see the う - Verb 合 う used in its past tense form, linking an (A) noun to a (B) noun. This has a similar meaning, but is closer to '(B) that has met (A)'. In sentences that use either of these expressions, more information is usually given about why something is happening in accordance with (A), or what the purpose of (B) meeting (A) is/was. Caution With 合 わせて, sometimes the meaning is as simple as 'at the same time as (A)', or 'together with (A)'. However, (A) will still be perceived as being the primary cause/reason for whatever happens in the (B) part of the sentence.",N3
に向かって,に向かって・に向けて,,"Towards, To face, To head to","Coming from a link between に and the う-Verb 向 かう 'to face', or 'to go towards' in its て-form, に 向 かって indicates that some specific action is being done 'towards (A)' or 'facing (A)'. (A) usually marks a stationary object or destination in the form of a noun. However, it can also mark less obvious destinations, such as the future ' 未来 '. Additionally, when 向 ける (the transitive form of the verb) is used, it will imply that the speaker is intentionally 'aiming' or 'facing' something towards (A). This is especially true when the objective of the speaker is to make something 'suitable' for (A).",N2
に堪えない,に堪えない,,"Cannot bear to, Cannot stand to, Too much to, Cannot go on doing, Cannot tolerate","に 堪 えない is a construction that will translate as ‘to not be able to bear (A)’, or ‘to not be able to tolerate (A)’. It is a mix of the case-marking particle に, and the negatived form of the る-Verb 堪 える ‘to tolerate’, 堪 えない. In this meaning, に 堪 えない will be used following verbs. This is in contrast to the に 堪 えない grammar point that follows nouns, and means ‘to be very (A)’, but is more literally ‘to be so (A) I can’t stand it’. Although 堪 える will be used more often than other kanji that have the same reading and similar meanings, this is not always the case. Occasionally 耐 える ‘to withstand’ will be used when the emphasis is on the ability to endure (A), while 絶 える ‘to discontinue’, or ‘to peter out’ will be used when the emphasis is on not being able to suppress (A). For 絶 える, this is especially used in the case of strong feelings. Caution The affirmative form of に 堪 える may also be used to express that something is ‘worth doing’. A closer interpretation of this would be similar to an English phrase like ‘to be passable for (A)’. Rather than meaning that something is particularly suitable, it just highlights that it also acceptably falls in the category of (A), despite not being intended for it, or perhaps not expected.",N1
に対して,に対して,,"In contrast to, While, In regard to, Whereas","に 対 する and に 対 して are two grammar patterns in Japanese that are regularly used to show when (B) is 'opposed to' or 'in contrast with' (A). 対 する itself is a verb meaning 'to oppose'. Although this feeling of 'opposition' may be negative, in most circumstances, it just means 'toward' in the sense of targeting something. に 対 する will be followed directly by a second noun, while に 対 して creates a pause in the sentence, before (B) will be explained in the second half of that sentence. Fun Fact Compared to に 関 して (another structure used to show how things 'relate' to each other), に 対 して focuses on (A) and (B) equally, explaining how those things interact, compare, or contrast each other. Caution As に 対 して strongly contrasts (A) and (B), this grammar structure will often be used to express differences between two things. This is very similar to 'whereas' in English.",N3
に当たる,に当たる,,"Correspond to, Amounts to, Equals to, Is appropriate","As mentioned in our 当 たり lesson, 当 たる often has a meaning that is similar to に 対 して 'to be in regard to'. Due to this, when combined with the case marking particle に , に 当 たる will be translated as 'to correspond to', 'to amount to', 'to be appropriate for', or 'to be in regard to'. These may seem quite different, but we will examine the similarities shortly. To use に 当 たる , attach it to the end of an (A) noun that you would like to mark as being the 'point of reference'. (B) may come directly after に 当 たる , or earlier in the sentence, so long as it is clearly separated from (A). As for the link between に 対 して and に 当 たる , it is as follows. In に 対 して, (A) and (B) exist simultaneously, but (B) opposes something about (A). に 当 たる , (A) and (B) exist simultaneously, but (B) matches something about (A). Due to this, unless the speaker is specifically trying to highlight something that is 'opposing', or 'matching', the base meaning of '(A) and (B) existing simultaneously' may be the standard translation.",N3
に応えて,に応えて,,"In response to, Meet","にこたえて is a construction formed from に, and the て-form of the る-Verb 応 える. It is often translated as 'to meet (A)', or 'in response to (A)'. Like に 応 じて 'to apply to', にこたえて indicates that (B) is something that will change based on what is considered necessary, suitable, or appropriate on a case-by-case basis when it comes to (A). にこたえて often appears in hiragana alone, and will attach to the end of nouns that it is marking as the (A) that something being done in response to. Alternatively, にこたえる will be used when connected directly to a second noun. In many cases, (A) will indicate a request, wish, or expectation.",N2
に応じて,に応じて,,"Depending or based on, According to, In response to, Suitable for or to,","に 応 じて is a combination of に, and the て-form of the る-Verb 応 じる 'to apply to'. This grammar structure is often translated as 'depending on (A), (B)', or 'in response to (A), (B)'. However; in almost all cases, it is just indicating that (B) is something that is done in a way that is 'applicable' to what is necessary of (A). に 応 じて will appear after nouns, or as に 応 じた when directly modifying a second noun. Fun-fact 応 じる usually indicates the way something 'responds to' or 'answers' an issue on a case-by-case basis. Due to this, what happens in (B) will frequently indicate something that changes depending on the intensity or severity of (A).",N2
に恥じない,に恥じない,,"Lives up to, Truly to …’s name, Worthy of, Not dishonor, Not putting to shame, Measure to","When showing that something lives up to an expected standard or level of quality, the phrase に 恥 じない will be used. This is a combination of the case-marking particle に, and the negated form of the る-Verb 恥 じる 'to shame'. The literal translation is 'without shaming (A)'. This structure will follow nouns. In many cases, (A) will be a word indicating an aspect of something that has come to be well known. Examples of this are 名 name, 名誉 'reputation', etc. As に 恥 じない has the nuance of 'not shaming (A)', or 'not damaging the reputation of (A)', it will usually only be used in positive contexts, where someone or something is being praised.",N1
に比べて,に比べて,,"Compared to, When compared to","に 比 べて is a set expression in Japanese, used when comparing one thing to another. It is often simply translated as '(A) compared to (B)', or 'when comparing (A) to (B)'. 比 べる is a る - Verb that means 'to compare', or 'to contrast'. に 比 べて will be attached directly after a noun, before the (B) part of the sentence will explain the comparison that is being made. Occasionally, the case marking particle と will be used instead of に . に and と are largely interchangeable in this expression, with に focusing slightly more on the changes/differences between similar features of (A) and (B). Alternatively と often mutually contrasts (A) and (B), discussing their individual/unique characteristics. Caution The way that 比 べる is conjugated is not overly important to the sentence, so long as the meaning of 'if', or 'when' is conveyed. Due to this, に 比 べたら, に 比 べれば, and に 比 べると are all possible combinations.",N3
に気を付ける,に気をつける,,"Take care, Be careful, Pay attention, Make sure, Watch out","Another of the large number of collocations in Japanese based on 気 'attention', or 'focus', is 気 を 付 ける . This is just a combination of the noun 気 , を, and the る-Verb 付 ける 'to adhere', or 'to attach'. 気 を 付 ける primarily follows (A) に. This marks (A) as something that the speaker is 'adhering' their attention to, and translates as 'to pay attention to (A)', 'to be careful of (A)', or 'to watch out for (A)'. This grammar pattern is used after nouns or noun-like phrases, indicating the thing that is being warned about, or that the speaker themselves is being cautious of. Most often, 気 を 付 ける will be used to warn about possible errors that could be made, mistakes, or simply the loss of focus. Due to this, it frequently follows negative verbs as ないよう, highlighting that something should be done in a 'manner' that doesn't result in (A).",N2
に決まっている,に決まっている,,"Surely, Bound to, Certainly, Be decided","に 決 まっている is a strong expression which indicates that (A) is something that the speaker either strongly believes to be true (but cannot confirm), or that they believe that (A) is only natural. These meanings primarily end up being translated as 'surely (A)', 'bound to be (A)', or 'certainly (A)'. As this structure is a combination of に and the ている-form of the う-Verb 決 まる 'to decide', the closest literal translation is 'for (A) to be decisively the case'. に 決 まっている may appear directly following verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns. に 決 まっている primarily focuses on the speaker's subjective opinion about (A). This means that it takes into consideration their own preformed opinions or thoughts about (A), regardless of what the actual facts may be.",N2
に沿って,に沿って,,"Along, In accordance with, In line with","When used with the case marking particle に, the う-Verb 沿 う 'to run alongside' in its て-form expresses that something is going 'along with (A)', 'in accordance with (A)', or 'in line with (A)'. This is primarily in relation to laws, conventions, traditions, needs, and other things which are not usually deviated away from. The nuance with this particular grammar structure is that (A) is the controlling factor, and (B) is being done with that in consideration. に 沿 って may also appear with the verb in its standard form when paired with a second noun, in order to modify that noun. As the base meaning of 沿 う is 'to follow along', it will also regularly be seen in relation to going along some specific path or street. While this grammar structure is relatively formal, when literally meaning 'alongside', it will be used fairly frequently.",N2
に照らして,に照らして・に照らすと,,"In light of, Based on, According to, Referencing, Comparing against, In view of","に 照 らして is an expression based on the standard meaning of the う-Verb 照 らす 'to illuminate', and is primarily used comparatively in a similar way to 'in light of' in English. This comparative meaning aims to illustrate (B) from the perspective of (A), and usually refers to situations, level of experience, or something similar. To use this structure, attach the case-marking particle に to the end of a noun, then follow it with 照 らして. If a second noun will be modified directly, then 照 らした will be used instead. Keep in mind that the に in this structure is marking (A) as the 'doer' of 照 らす 'to illuminate', as it is a transitive verb. This means that the structure has a more literal translation of '(B) as reflected by (A)'. This can also be thought of as 'as made clear by (A), (B)', 'as made evident by (A), (B)'. (B) will almost always be a judgment that is logically based on (A).",N1
に相違ない,に相違ない,,"Without a doubt, Certainly, Surely, Not mistaken","In a similar fashion to に 違 いない, に 相違 ない is a structure that firmly states that something is 'without a doubt (A)', or that there is 'no mistaking (A)'. It may be used to strengthen one's own opinions, or to strongly agree with the opinion of another. Although 相違 may be used by itself meaning 'to differ', or 'to have a discrepancy', 相違 ない is considered as a set い-Adjective. When combined with ない, the literal meaning is just 'there is no discrepancy in (A)'. に 相違 ない may be used with verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives and nouns. に相違ない will often follow から, highlighting that there is no mistaking the 'cause' of (A). Caution This grammar structure is very formal, with に 違 いない almost always being used in its place.",N2
に至っては,に至っては,,"When it comes to, As for, In particular, What is worse or more","に 至 っては is an expression which presents the most extreme example for something from within a specific category. Due to this, it will usually be translated as 'when it comes to (A), (B)', 'in particular to (A) is (B)', or 'with (A) as the most extreme example, (B)'. This is a combination of the case-marking particle に, the て-form of the る-Verb 至 る 'to climax', or 'to culminate in', and the adverbial particle は in its standard role of presenting a topic. In this way, the literal meaning of 'culminating within (A) is (B)' is quite close to the nuance of the English translations. に 至 っては will appear following nouns, or nominalized phrases. Caution As the verb 至 る itself is used to present extreme examples or locations that are considered to be right 'on the precipice' of something, に 至 っては will primarily present things that are surprising or astonishing in some way. This is primarily only used when the example itself is quite negative or unfavorable.",N1
に至っても,に至っても,,Even when,"In contrast to に 至 っては , which presents the most extreme examples for something from within a specific category. に 至 っても will present the same extreme example from which some result will not occur. This is due to the adverbial particle も 'even' replacing は. に 至 っても may be translated as 'even if it came to (A), (B)', 'even when (A), (B)'. (B) will often be negative, thus highlighting that even the extreme (A) couldn't affect (B). This is a combination of the case-marking particle に, the て-form of the る-Verb 至 る 'to climax', or 'to culminate in', and the adverbial particle も. に 至 っても will appear following nouns, or verbs in their dictionary form . に 至 っても will often be used when the speaker laments or regrets that despite reaching the point of (A), (B) is something that will still not, or did not change. However, it may occasionally be used positively, especially when the speaker is expressing their determination.",N1
に至って,に至って・に至り,,"When it came to, Only when, Only after, Go as far as","Just like in other grammar points that include the う-Verb 至 る 'to result in', or 'to reach a climax', に 至 って will indicate (A) as an extreme extent from which (B) results. The case marking particle に will mark either a verb or noun as the extent that 至 る is signifying as being extreme. Common translations include 'only when (A), did (B)', and 'going as far as to (A), (B)'. The extreme extent that に 至 って implies will often be the result of something that has been left far too long in a certain state. Due to this, に 至 って is often used in relation to criticism of a lack of action. As with many other grammar structures that use verbs, occasionally the formal conjunctive 至 り will replace the standard て-form 至 って. Caution に 至 って and に 至 っても have quite different meanings, the primary thing to be aware of is as follows. (A) に 至 って (B) - Only when reaching the extreme of (A) did (B) occur. (A) に 至 っても (B) - Even if reaching the extreme of (A), (B) won't occur. に 至 っても will be covered in its own grammar point.",N1
に至るまで(),に至るまで,,"(Everything) from...to..., From…up until..., Starting with...ending with...","至 る is an う-Verb which can be roughly translated as 'to attain (A)', or 'to reach the climax of (A)'. This verb is seen in several different grammar structures that all basically highlight that some extreme or unexpected extent is being reached. When paired with に and まで, に 至 るまで is often interpreted as 'everything from (A) to (B)'. Comparative statements such as から or より frequently come directly after (A), while に 至 るまで will come directly after (B). This marks (B) as the 'extreme' extent. Both (A) and (B) will either be nouns or noun phrases. The 'to reach a climax' meaning of 至 る itself can be used as an indicator that grammar points that use this verb all indicate some kind of exceptionally wide range between (A) and (B). Due to this, 至 るまで can be thought of as simply a strong emphasis of まで by itself, which also marks an extent.",N1
に言わせると,に言わせれば・に言わせると・に言わせたら,,"If you ask, In … opinion, According to","に 言 わせれば is a structure that will be attached to nouns, in order to indicate a person or group that is giving a strong opinion. It is usually translated as 'if you ask (A), (B)', or 'according to (A), (B)'. The literal meaning is 'if (A) is allowed to speak, (B)', as this pattern is just a combination of the case-marking particle に, the う-Verb 言 う 'to say' followed by the hypothetical form of the auxiliary verb せる, せれ 'to allow to do', and the conjunction particle ば. To use this structure, simply attach it to the end of a noun marking the person or group whose opinion is being given. Other hypothetical structures such as と and たら may also be used, but ば is the most common. Additionally, this pattern may sound self-important, so is best used sparingly, especially when giving your own opinions. Occasionally, から will be used instead of に. Caution With the auxiliary verbs せる and させる, it will be important to remember that に tends to be mark the doer when they are being allowed to do something, as in this case, while を will be used more frequently when the doer is being made to do something.",N1
に越したことはない,に越したことはない,,"There is nothing better than, It is the best, Would be the best","Used to convey the meanings of 'there is nothing better than (A)', or '(A) would be the best', に 越 したことはない is a phrase that combines に, the past-tense form of 越 す, an う-Verb meaning 'to cross over', or 'to surpass', こと, は, and ない. Literally, it means 'there is nothing beyond (A)', or 'nothing surpasses (A)'. This structure will be seen with verbs, adjectives, and nouns in their standard forms. に 越 したことはない sentences generally present something positive, or some ideal outcome that is wished for. Caution - It is also quite common to see に 越 したことはない following words that use ない. In these cases, rather than '(A) would be the best', the meaning simply changes to 'it would be best if not (A)'.",N2
に足りない,に足りない,,"To not be worthy, To not be enough, To not be sufficient, To lack","に 足 りない is a grammar expression appearing after the dictionary form of verbs used to indicate that something is 'not worth (A)', or 'not sufficient for (A)'. It comes from a combination of the case-marking particle に, and the る-Verb 足 りる 'to be sufficient', or 'to be enough'. This structure is formal, so will mostly be used in literature or formal speech settings. While に 足 りない may be similar to another grammar point, に 足 る , in that they are conversely pointing out the worth, or lack of worth of something, they are actually different verbs. 足 る is an う-Verb, and is often used more in literature, or in western Japan. This means that the negative form of 足 る is 足 らない, not 足 りない. Caution Both 足 りない and 足 らない may be used as part of the set phrase 取 るに 足 りない, 'to be worthless', or 'to not be worth taking up for discussion'.",N1
に足る,に足る,,"To be worthy of, To be enough, To be sufficient","足 る, an う-Verb meaning 'to be sufficient', is often paired with に and either verbs or nouns in order to indicate that something is 'worthy of (A)', or 'enough for (A)'. This is quite a formal grammar structure, so is primarily seen in books, or may be used in speeches. に 足 る will follow verbs in their dictionary form , or nouns. As 足 る itself will always appear in the dictionary form , it must be followed by a second noun which it will be modifying as the thing that is or is not worthy of something. Caution に 足 る may come after する, or immediately follow the noun that would usually have する added to it. The primary difference is that に 足 る following する will put more emphasis on the action of (A). Caution When wanting to say that something is 'not worth (A)', に 足 る will not appear as に 足 りない. In these cases, the following verb will need to be negated, not 足 る itself.",N1
に違いない,に違いない,,"There is no doubt that, I'm sure","When the case marking particle に is combined with the noun 違 い 'difference', and the い-Adjective ない, an expression similar to 'there is no doubt that (A)', or 'I'm sure that (A)' is created. に 違 いない may be used with any verbs, い-Adjectives , な-Adjectives or nouns in their plain form. Fun Fact As に is marking the preceding word in this expression as an existing location (or state), 違 いない is stating that no 'variance' exists within that state. This means that the literal translation of に 違 いない is close to 'there is no discrepancy in (A)'. Caution It should be noted that 違 いない is a combination of a noun and an い-Adjective , and not the negative form of the う - Verb 違 う, which would be 違 わない. 違 いない translates as 'there is no difference', while 違 わない would translate as 'it is not different'.",N3
に関して,に関する・に関して,,"Related to, About, Regarding","に 関 する and に 関 して are two grammar patterns in Japanese that are regularly used to show when (B) is 'about' or 'related to' (A). 関 する itself is a verb meaning 'to relate'. に 関 する will be followed directly by a second noun, while に 関 して creates a pause in the sentence, before (B) will be explained in the second half of that sentence. Fun Fact Compared to について (another structure used to convey 'about'), に 関 して is quite a bit more formal, and will rarely be used in casual conversation.",N3
に限ったことではない,に限ったことではない,,"Not limited to, Not restricted to, Not only","に 限 ったことではない is a fairly emphatic expression that, like several other grammar patterns, makes use of the う-Verb 限 る 'to limit'. It is a combination of the case-marking particle に, the past tense of 限 る, 限 った, the noun こと 'thing', the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb だ, で, the adverbial particle は, and the い-Adjective, ない. The literal translation is 'it is not something that is limited to (A)', but other common interpretations include 'not only (A), but (B)', or 'not restricted to (A), (B) too'. This structure will be used following nouns, and tends to be reserved for fairly formal situations. This grammar pattern often indicates that (A) is something that is not especially rare, so should not be, or does not require to be treated in any special way.",N1
に限って,に限って,,"Particularly when, Those who, Only when","The expression に 限 って in Japanese is a phrase that has three primary uses, the first is to show that (B) is an unbelievable thing about (A), the second is to express that something is limited to (A), and the third highlights that in most cases for (A), (B). Depending on the particular nuance that is being used, common translations include 'particularly when (A), (B)', 'those who (A), (B)', and 'only when (A), (B)'. This structure is comprised of に, and the て-form of the う-Verb 限 る 'to limit'. Let's look at a few examples of each potential meaning. First, when something about (A) is unbelievable due to what is either expected or previously known. Second, when something is limited to (A). Third, when (B) is true in most cases concerning (A). While each of these uses can roughly be translated as 'only when', it will be important to keep all three meanings in mind when interpreting sentences that use に 限 って .",N2
に限らず,に限らず,,"Not just, Not only… but also","に 限 らず is a sentence pattern in Japanese used that highlights when something is 'not just (A), but (B) too', or 'not only (A), but also (B)'. It is a combination of に, the う-Verb 限 る 'to limit', and the literary auxiliary verb ず, which connects with verbs in the same way, and carries the same meaning as ない. This structure will appear after nouns, before the (B) part of the sentence will go on to explain things that can be included in the same scope or category as (A). Occasionally, も may be added for extra emphasis in the (B) part of に限らず sentences. This is especially true when several extra things are being indicated, not just (B). For example, '(B) も (C) も'.",N2
に限る,に限る,,"Nothing better than, There's nothing like, Limited to","に 限 る is a combination of the case marking particle に (marking a location), and the う - Verb 限 る 'to limit'. This expression can be translated as 'there's nothing better than (A)', or 'there's nothing like (A)'. に 限 る may be paired with verbs in their base form, or with nouns. に 限 る may also appear with verbs that have been negated with the auxiliary verb ない. Care will need to be taken with translating these sentences, as they will express that 'there is nothing better than -not- doing (A)'. Fun Fact The literal meaning of 限 る is 境 を 付 ける 'to set a boundary'. This means that に marks the location (or situation), within which the speaker then states as being 'the boundary'. Because of this, 'to be bound to', or 'to be limited to', are also possible translations of に 限 る.",N3
に際して,に際して,,"On the occasion of, At the time of","Like 際 に 'on the occasion of (A)', に 際 して will be used to show some particular occasion, and is used most frequently in regard to one-off events, or chance occurrences. However, unlike 際 に , に 際 して is a combination of に, and the て-form of 際 する, which is a verb that usually has the meaning of 'to come to pass'. Despite the more literal translation of 'when (A) comes to pass', に 際 して will often just be interpreted as 'on the occasion of (A)', or 'at the time of (A)'. This is a formal grammar pattern that is seen connected either to nouns, or verbs in their dictionary form. Caution While there are many similarities between 際 に and に 際 して , a few key differences exist. The first being that に 際 して is primarily used when (B) is something that will be done before (A), or when presented with the situation of (A). However, in the case of 際 に , the nuance is more specifically 'on the occasion of (A)', marking the exact point in time, rather than the approach to that time. Following on from this example, because に 際 して highlights the approach to a specific situation, it will never appear connected to verbs in the past tense. 際 に , on the other hand, frequently appears with verbs in the past tense, as it can highlight the 'occasion' of an action being complete.",N2
に難くない,に難くない,,"Not hard to, Not difficult to, Easy to, Is obvious that","にかたくない is a formal grammar pattern that uses a different version of the い-Adjective 難 しい 'difficult', 難 い, which has the same meaning. This adjective will be used in the negative, in order to indicate that something is 'not difficult'. The case-marking particle に at the beginning is limited to following verbs that indicate thinking or conjecture. This structure will only appear with quite a limited number of verbs, with 想像 'to imagine', 予想 'to predict', 察 する 'to infer' or 'to sense', 理解 'to understand', and 推測 'to guess' making up the majority of them. Fun Fact Many words have alternative forms that will be described as (A) の 改 まった 表現 'the reformed version of (A)' in Japanese dictionaries. Although the standard meaning of the る-Verb 改 まる is 'to redo', it can also often be 'to reform' in the sense of making something ceremonious or formal. (A) will usually be the far more common or everyday version of a word, such as with 難 しい in the case of this grammar point.",N1
に,に,,"Times (In each time period), Every, Frequency of","When the case marking particle に is used, sometimes it has the nuance of 'frequency'. This means that it can be utilized to describe how often something happens/is done. In this grammatical construction, the 'time frame' is followed by に , then followed by the number of times that you would like to say that something happens. In this way, に keeps its regular nuance of being a 'goal', or 'destination', within which something else takes place. Caution This use of に should not be confused with で in relation to time. When で is used for 'time', it is expressing the amount of time that is required to do something, or how much time something is expected to take. It is not used for frequency. Due to this, you can think of に as marking a portion (or portions) of time inside of a larger space of time, within which something happens. However, で marks a whole space of time, within which something can be/is completed.",N4
に,に,prt,"In, At, To, For, On","に can be a very difficult particle to master in Japanese, as it has many different translations in English. These translations are usually 'in', 'at', 'to', 'for', or 'on'. Let's look at an example of each meaning. While these examples may seem quite confusing at first, it will be easier to think of に as always having one 'basic' meaning. That meaning is to be the 'end-point' of an action. This means that whatever action is being described, can only be considered complete/able to be completed once you're at/while you're at the location/time described in the sentence. Verbs like 住 む (to live/dwell) often confuse learners, as they use に instead of で . This is also due to the fact that 住 む is a verb that can only be 'completed' at the destination. (You can only complete the act of living/dwelling in the place that you live, so to speak).",N5
ぬ,ぬ,,"Classical negative, Classical verb [ない]","ぬ is the attributive form of ず, a classical auxiliary verb that is used for negation like ない, and connects to verbs in the same way. As ぬ is the attributive form of ず, it may be seen modifying nouns that directly follow it. However, this use is not common in modern times, and in many cases it will be used as part of set expressions that have not changed in the time since ない became the far more widely used structure for negation. Alternatively, it may just be used for artistic expression, or to make a character seem 'classical'. In the case that the verb being negated is いる, the old fashion おる will be modified to おらぬ instead. Alternatively, する will be negated as せぬ , and くる will be negated as こぬ . This is consistent with the standard conjugation patterns seen with the use of ず.",N2
ねばなら,ねばならない,,"Must, Have to, Should","Unlike the standard ば form of hypothetical phrases, ねば makes use of the classical auxiliary verb ず in its ね form. However, the meaning is the same as the modern なければ  'if not (A)'. ねば connects to verbs in the same way as ない, and will then be followed by the negative form of なる 'to become', ならない. Like なければならない , ねばならない will translate to 'must do (A)', or 'have to do (A)', and is simply a double negative that literally means 'if not (A), it won't be (B)'. This is a formal structure, and will mostly be found in literature. As ね is a form of the literary auxiliary verb ず, the base of する will change to せねば, in the same way it changes to せず in other grammar patterns. Caution Sometimes ならない will be replaced with ならぬ. This has exactly the same meaning and just makes use of the ぬ attributive form of the same auxiliary verb ,  ず. While not changing the meaning at all, the addition of ぬ will make the overall expression sound even more old-fashioned. Fun-fact As with other 'must' double-negative structures, the second part of the ねばならない may sometimes be omitted, resulting in ねば or せねば appearing by itself. This is similar to the modern ないと appearing without いけない following it.",N2
ね,ね,prt,"Isn't it?, Right? (Sentence ending particle)","ね is classified as a sentence ending particle in Japanese. It may also be pronounced as ねえ . ね is used when the speaker is looking for agreement from someone, or wants confirmation about something. Due to this, it is often translated as 'right?', or 'isn't it?'. To use ね , simply add it to the end of almost any sentence. As we will cover in our lesson about the sentence ending particle な , ね can almost be thought of as the opposite. ね is used when expressing a shared opinion, a shared thought, or generally something you think will be agreed with by the listener. However, な focuses almost exclusively on the speaker, and their own thoughts. Fun Fact よ and ね are very frequently combined together to make the sentence ender よ ね . This is used purely when you expect the listener will agree with you. Caution ね is much weaker than でしょう or だろう , and is sometimes said purely out of habit, without much nuance of 'right' at all.",N5
のが上手,のがじょうず,exp,"To be good at, Proficient","～のが 上手 is a phrase that behaves in almost exactly the same way as ～のが 好 き , but rather than meaning 'to like' something, it means 'to be good at' something. This particular expression is used with the plain (dictionary) form of verbs only. In these examples, we can see that there is no difference between Ichidan verbs and Godan   verbs. Both will appear in their plain form. In this expression, のが is performing the same function as in the regular のは・のが construction. This function is nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun). However, のは cannot be used with this phrase, as が is always required with adjectives. Caution If you want to express that you were good at something (in the past), the verb will still remain in the plain form, but 上手 will change to the past tense. Caution This grammar point can sound a little bit arrogant if you are referring to your own skills, so the word 得意 may also be used if you want to sound a bit more humble.",N5
のが好き,のがすき,exp,"Like doing, Love doing","～のが 好 き is a common construction that is used in Japanese to express that you like/love doing something. This particular expression is used with the plain ( dictionary ) form of verbs only. In these examples, we can see that there is no difference between Ichidan verbs and Godan verbs . Both will be used in their plain forms. In this expression, のが is performing the same function as in the regular のは or のが construction. This function is nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun). However, のは may not be used with this phrase, as が will always appear with adjectives. Caution If you want to express that you liked doing something (in the past), the verb will still remain in the plain form, but 好 き will change to past tense. This construction can also be used to ask questions about what other people like. This is done through the addition of か .",N5
のが下手,のがへた,exp,"To be bad at, Poor at, Unskillful","～のが 下手 is a phrase that behaves in almost exactly the same way as ～のが 上手 , but rather than meaning 'to be good at (A)', it means 'to be bad at (A)', (which is a much more handy expression, if you are like me!). This particular expression is used with the plain (dictionary) form of verbs only. In these examples, we can see that there is no difference between Ichidan verbs and Godan verbs. Both will appear in their plain form. In this expression, のが is performing the same function as in the regular のは, and のが constructions. This function is nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun). However, のは cannot be used with this phrase, as が is always required with adjectives. Caution If you want to express that you were bad at something (in the past), the verb will still remain in the plain form, but 下手 will change to the past tense.",N5
のだろうか,～のだろうか,,I wonder...,"When using だろう (the conjugated auxiliary verb) is grouped with か (the question particle), it presents the statement before it as something that the speaker is unsure about. In this way, it sounds similar to 'I wonder if (A)' in English. To use this construction, the statement before だろうか must be nominalized (turned into a noun-phrase). This is done through the use of の , or なの (in the case of な-Adjectives and nouns). Despite the grammatical rule relating to nominalization using の (or なの ), this part of the phrase is often omitted. だろうか is quite masculine, so in order to sound more polite/ladylike, でしょうか may also be used instead. Caution Although だろうか is quite masculine, it does not strictly mean that でしょうか is feminine. でしょうか may be used confidently by either women or men. Fun Fact Like だろう , だろうか may be used to ask a question, or simply to express the speaker's inner thoughts. However, だろうか is most commonly used to express a personal 'I wonder', in a similar way to かな . Because of this, even if it is used as a question, the listener may assume that you are not specifically looking for an answer from them.",N4
のではないでしょうか,のではないだろうか,,"I think ... isn't it?, It might be that..., Don't you agree?","のではないだろうか is a fairly long grammar pattern in Japanese that is used when one wants to express their opinion indirectly, in the form of a rhetorical question. Common translations include 'I think it's (A), isn't it?', and 'it might be that (A)'. However, being that this is just a combination of の, ではない 'isn't', だろう 'probably', and か, the literal meaning is simply 'is it probably not that it's (A)'. Just like in English, the elongation of the phrase and not saying anything with certainty makes it sound more modest. のではないだろうか may be seen following verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns when preceded with な. Additionally, でしょう may replace だろう. This phrase can also be used when seeking agreement from the listener, or when mildly trying to persuade them that your way of thinking may be correct.",N2
ので,ので,prt,"Because, So, Since, The reason being","ので is a Japanese grammar structure called a conjunction particle. This means that it connects two parts of a sentence 'logically'. The connection that ので makes between (A), and (B), is similar to から , meaning that it is often translated as 'because', or 'since'. When used after な-Adjectives or nouns, な must precede ので . When used as 'since', ので puts emphasis on the sentence as a whole, or on the effects caused. It then examines those reasons objectively (in a way that is based on facts, rather than feelings or opinions). から tends to be more subjective, and can sound much more vague when used as 'because'. We can see here that から is not quite as strong as ので . This relates back to the base meaning of から being ' from ', rather than ' because '. Caution ので can sometimes be seen as んで , which is a more casual variation. Also, unlike many grammar points that connect to verbs, ので may be used with the ます form. This is something that is unique to conjunction particles.",N5
の中で～が一番,のなかで～がいちばん～,exp,"Out of ~, ~ is the best/most ~","In Japanese '(A) の 中 で (B) が 一番 (C)', is a regular expression that is used for showing that something is 'the most (C)', usually an adjective. This structure can be used with almost any adjective, whether it is positive or negative. Each part of this grammar point represents the following: (A) - A group. (B) - A single thing/person within that group. (C) - An adjective, or general description of that thing/person. This expression is also frequently used with demonstratives such as この and その . The construction ' (A) の 中 で ' is regularly translated by itself as ' among (A) ', and may be used in many different expressions. This will be covered in a separate grammar point .",N5
の中で,のなかで,,"In, Among, Within","Just like the grammar point の 中 で～が 一番 ～ , this grammar point may be used when marking one thing from within a group, and then further describing it. The only difference is that の 中 で by itself simply marks something as being 'among (A)', or 'within (A)', rather than being the 'most (A)'. の 中 で is also frequently used to describe things that are happening within a place, and will translate simply as 'in (A)', in these cases.",N4
のなんのって,のなんのって,,"So much that, Extremely, Very","のなんのって is a casual phrase that is used in spoken Japanese to indicate that the word before it is 'excessively (A)', or 'extremely (A)'. This structure consists of the case marking particle の, the pre-noun adjectival 何 の 'what kind of', and って, an abbreviation of という 'to say'. The literal meaning of 'and to say it's (A) or something' just indicates that something is so (A) that if it is not that then the speaker doesn't know what to call it. This structure will be seen after い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives followed by な, and verbs. のなんのって itself is a more condensed variation of ～の～ないのって , which has the same meaning, but has (A) appear in both the positive and negative for 'to say it's (A) or not (A), (B)', where (B) will usually be a phrase explaining the extent of (A). Occasionally (B) will be left unsaid, as ～の～ないのって itself is always used to mean 'extremely (A)'.",N1
のに,のに,,"Despite, Although, Even though","Although のに is often thought of as a simple combination of the particles の and に , it is actually its own particle, with the meaning of 'despite', or 'in order to'. In this lesson, we will focus primarily on the 'despite' nuance. Due to のに being a conjunction particle , it can be linked to almost any word type, to show that 'despite (A), (B)'. As with many conjunction particles, な will be required after a noun/ な-Adjective , but before のに . It is also possible to see だ のに , instead of なのに , but this is something that is only seen in certain dialects, and would be considered incorrect by the vast majority of native speakers. Fun Fact Regardless of having two quite different translations ('despite', and 'in order to'), のに always functions in the same way. In the situation of '(A) のに , (B)', (B) is/will be the result. The only difference between how the nuance will be read, is whether the (B) statement is a logical conclusion, or an illogical one. When logical, the meaning is usually 'in order to', when 'illogical', the meaning is usually 'despite'.",N4
のに,のに,,In order to,"Regarded as a conjunction particle by itself, のに is simply a fusion of the case marking particles の and に. のに has two primary functions in Japanese. It can be used to show that something is the opposite of what is expected for (A) (translated as 'despite'), or it can be used to show that something is required for (A) to be realized (translated as 'in order to'). We will focus on the 'in order to' meaning in this lesson. To use のに , simply attach it to the base (non-past) form of a verb that you would like to express as being the 'goal', before following it with the conditions required to meet that goal. Fun Fact Although のに can be translated as 'despite', or 'in order to', it actually has the same meaning in each of these situations. の nominalizes what comes before it (turning it into a noun-phrase), while に converts that new noun-phrase into a 'location', or 'goal'. In this way, のに always means 'to that which is (A), (B)'.",N3
のは,の,prt,"Verb nominalizer, The one who..., That which...","In Japanese, のは and のが behave in a very similar way to the words 'that' and 'which' in English. This means that they perform a task called nominalization . Nominalization is when a phrase is treated in the same way as a single noun. Rather than a single noun, we can see from these examples that the phrases 沢山 食 べ る のは and バスに 乗 る のが are behaving in the same way that a single noun would. In English, this can either mean 'that which', or 'the one who/that'. This construction can be used after verbs in any tense, except for the polite ます or ません, which are only used at the end of a sentence, or certain clauses. Caution の cannot be used as a substitute for こと in set expressions like ことができる , or ことがある . It also may not be followed by だ , である , or です , as this would become the explanatory ～んです , or のです in that case.",N5
のが,の,prt,"Verb nominalizer, The one who..., That which...","In Japanese, のは and のが behave in a very similar way to the words 'that' and 'which' in English.

のは～の方だ,のはXの方だ,,"It is...that..., It is...who..., ...is the one that..., ...is the one who...","のは～の 方 だ is an expression used to show that (A) (usually despite expectations) is (B). It can be translated as 'the one that (A), is (B)'. This phrase is made up of the following parts: のは - Used for nominalization (creating a noun phrase). は highlights contrast between two (or more) elements. の 方 - A combination of の, the case marking particle , and 方 , a noun meaning 'side', or 'direction'. だ (or です ) - The auxiliary verb used for 'determining' something. The literal meaning of this grammar point is something similar to 'that which is (A), is on the side of (B)'. By saying that something is on the 'side' of (B), it comes across more gently than expressly stating that it 'is (B)'. To use this construction, attach のは to the end of a phrase, and then follow it with a noun + の 方 だ. Note that のは will become なのは if the final word before のは is a noun. Fun Fact This phrase is often used apologetically, to express that someone feels that they are the individual who is (more) responsible (for causing a certain outcome).",N3
のみならず,のみならず,,"Not only...but, Not just...but, What is more","のみならず is a structure consisting of のみ, the literary particle equivalent of だけ meaning 'just' or 'only', the negative stem-form of the う-Verb なる 'to be', and the literary auxiliary verb ず, which connects with verbs in the same way, and carries the same meaning as ない. This expression indicates that something is 'not just (A), but also (B)', or 'not only (A), but (B) too'. のみ connects to words in the same way as だけ, so this pattern will be seen following Verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns. Occasionally, のみならず may function as a conjunction, appearing at the beginning of a new sentence. In these cases, the meaning is the same, but usually translates closer to 'what's more', 'furthermore', or 'moreover'. Caution As this structure is formal, it will primarily be seen in literature, or heard in speeches.",N2
のも尤もだ,のももっともだ,,"May well, Have or has good reason for, No wonder, … Is only natural","のももっともだ is a combination of の, も, the な-Adjective もっとも, meaning 'reasonable', or 'plausible', and the auxiliary verb だ. In many cases, the interpretation will be 'it may well be (A)', 'it's only natural that (A)', or 'there's no wonder that (A)'. However, 尤 も itself is simply an adjective that affirms that the speaker understands the thought process behind (A), and that it is logical to them, regardless of whether or not they actually agree with it themselves. Due to this, 'it may well be (A)' in English is actually a very close translation of the feeling behind the expression. のももっともだ will appear with verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, and nouns. In the case of nouns, the の will be dropped, as the noun itself will become the expression being marked as the focus. Due to のももっともだ being used when the speaker is expressing that they understand the underlying reasons behind something, phrases used for explanation such as から or ので will often be seen in the same sentence.",N2
のも当然だ,のも当然だ,,"It is only natural that, It is no wonder","Like て 当然 だ , the grammar point indicating that (A) is 'natural' or 'obvious', のは 当然 だ works in a similar way, and highlights that it is 'no wonder that (A)', or 'it is only natural that (A)'. This construction will be seen following verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns that are followed by な. As can be seen in several of the above examples, も may replace は, with only a slight change in nuance (も will place extra emphasis on the obviousness of the remark, according to the speaker). Compared to て 当然 だ , のは 当然 だ is slightly stronger, and separates the previous statement from what the speaker considers 'natural'. This is equivalent to the difference between 'being happy is natural' (slightly weaker), and 'it's natural that one would be happy' (slightly stronger) in English.",N2
の様に,のように・のような,,"Like (Noun), Similar to (Noun)","The auxiliary verb ようだ is used for making observations. It states that something is 'in the manner/way of (A)'. Like the auxiliary verb そうだ , ようだ may be used in a similar way to な-Adjectives (can be followed by な when acting as an adjective, or に when acting as an adverb). の is required before these constructions when it is describing a noun. Because よう (coming from the kanji 様 ) usually expresses the 'manner' in which something is existing/happening, it is regularly used when the speaker has direct personal experience from which they are drawing a comparison. This means that よう will sound far more confident than みたい , or そう . Fun Fact When ようだ is describing another word (in its ような , or ように form), this is known as 'presenting an example' ( 例示 in Japanese), and means that '(A) is an example of (B)'.",N4
の下で,の下で,,"Under, Under the supervision of, On the basis of","When the noun 下 'underneath' is combined with either of the case marking particles で or に, it will indicate that something is happening either under the influence, guidance, or basis of (A). (A) will be a noun that is connected to 下 で or に through the case-marking particle の. In this grammar structure, (A) may mark either a specific person or some situation equally as naturally. Occasionally, に or で will be able to be omitted in preference of a comma directly after 下 . This expression is considered quite formal, and the omission of the particle in favor of a comma will make it sound even more formal. Fun-fact の 下 で may be replaced with 下 attached directly to many different nouns, and still carry the same meaning. Examples of these are 統治下 'under the reign', 指揮下 'under the direction', 影響下 'under the influence', 占領下 'under the occupation', 支配下 'under the control', and others.",N2
の姿,～(の)姿,,"Figure, Shape, Appearance, Looks, Wearing, Dressed in, Presence","When the noun 姿 'figure' is used as a suffix , it describes the outward appearance of someone. This may be in relation to what the person is wearing, their overall shape, body type, or style. 姿 is often translated as '(A) looking', 'wearing (A)', 'clad in (A)', or 'performing (A)'. 姿 may be used after verbs in their attributive form , or after nouns followed by the case marking particle の. 姿 is a word that focuses primarily on the way that someone appears to observer. Therefore, it is also often used to describe the observer's impression of who they are looking at, in regard to their presence, or lack thereof. Caution After nouns, の will sometimes be omitted, but this is not always the case. In general, の may be dropped after kanji compounds, but not after simple words like 人 , 時 , 元 , etc.",N3
の極み,の極み,,"Ultimate, Extreme, Utter, Epitome, Peak","When paired with a noun followed by the case-marking particle の, 極 み 'extremity' will indicate something that is 'the ultimate (A)', 'the extreme (A)', or 'the epitome of (A)'. This may be used in either positive or negative sentences. As 極 み itself is a noun, it will often be followed by the auxiliary verb だ, or the conjunctive form で when going on to describe something that is as a result of (A). Caution の 極 み is a structure that is paired with nouns, while 極 まる and 極 まりない are grammar patterns that will be paired with adjectives, despite the meanings being quite similar.",N1
の至り,の至り,,"Utmost, Height of, Extreme, Heartiest, Such a, Very, really, Completely, Deeply","の 至 り is a set, formal expression used to highlight that (A) is the highest level of something, and will often be used positively, although not exclusively. It is a combination of the case-marking particle の, and the noun 至 り 'pinnacle', or 'climax'. Common translations include 'the utmost (A)', or 'the extreme of (A). To use this structure, attach it to the end of a noun, where that noun is the 'limit' for whatever is being expressed. (A) is usually some emotion that can be experienced to a high degree when confronted with certain situations such as 光栄 'honor', 赤面 'embarrassment', 感謝 'gratefulness', 恐縮 'obligation', etc. Fun Fact 若気 の 至 り is a set expression that is used to indicate some blunder made on a count of being young and not thinking things through thoroughly. 若気 is a noun that roughly translates as 'youthful impetuousness'.",N1
の間に,の間に,,"While, During, Between, Period","間 に is an expression that can be used with almost any type of word, to highlight that (A) is the period/space within which something else will or did happen/exist. It may also be a period/space 'until' something else will or did happen/exist. It is a combination of the noun 間 , and the case marking particle に . When used with verbs or い-Adjectives , 間 に will simply follow the verb/adjective. However, の will be required after nouns, while な will be required after な-Adjectives . When 間 に is being used to express the period/space 'until' something happens/exists, it will be paired with まで. With 間 に , the (B) action/location is usually something that can or did happen/exist at a 'specific' point during (A), and does/did not take up the whole time-frame/space of (A). In this way, it can translate more literally as 'in the span of (A)'. This comes from the kanji 間 's common meaning as 'an interval'.",N3
の,の,prt,Possessive use (Noun omission),"A common pattern in Japanese is referring back to a noun that has already been mentioned, without actually repeating it.  This is achieved through the use of the particle の , in a similar way to its standard possessive use. The noun that would usually follow の is dropped, as it has either been said earlier in the sentence, or is understood clearly from context. In these examples, it would also be grammatically correct to use the same noun following の , but as can be seen in the English translation, it results in unnecessary repetition. This is called word stacking/redundant words ( 重 ね 言葉 ) in Japanese, and is considered a poor writing/speech habit. Despite this, it is important to know that this の is exactly the same as the possessive の (with the following word simply being left out). In the following sentence, we can see another common use of の that translates similarly to 'one' in English, when referring to non-specific things. From this, it is clear that the repeated noun is not needed. Japanese is a language that avoids repeating words in many situations. This example shows noun replacement, rather than noun omission, another common use of の which we will cover in another lesson.",N5
の,の,prt,Indicates possession,"From the perspective of English, の has several different meanings. It can indicate possession, like putting (A)'s on the end of a word. In Japanese, however, the meaning is a bit broader, and shows that (B) is an attribute/possession of (A). In the first sentence, we can see that の is showing ownership, however in the second sentence, it is simply showing a relationship between (A) and (B). の is also often used in the same way as が , to highlight the subject of a statement. Our lesson for が will be covered separately. Both of these examples are slightly advanced and use adjectives, but don't worry, we will be covering them next! Caution の is usually used after nouns, but can also be used after other types of words, specifically when it is transforming them into a noun-like phrase. This is called nominalization in English. We will cover this in detail in the の - Nominalization grammar point.",N5
は疎か,はおろか,,"Let alone, Much less, Needless to say, Not to mention, Not only but also","は 疎 か is an expression that works similarly to はもちろん 'of course (A), but (B)' in Japanese. 疎 か itself is a な-Adjective that means 'negligent', or 'alienation'. However, this use of 疎 か is not seen much in modern Japanese, and the word will mainly be used in set expressions where it doesn't behave exactly as a な-Adjective usually would. Despite this, the meaning of 'alienation', or 'completely removed from' is kept in はおろか , as it simply means 'completely putting aside (A), (B)'. Common translations include 'let alone (A), (B)', and 'it's needless to say that (A), when (B)'. (B) and (A) will usually be things that fall into the same category, where (B) is considered the far more obvious of the two. Due to this obviousness, (B) will often be immediately followed by the adverbial particle さえ. This shows that (B) is the noteworthy minimum extent. Alternatively, さえ may be exchanged with other adverbial particles that fill a similar purpose such a も, すら, or まで. In most cases, は 疎 か sentences tend to have a fairly negative nuance.",N1
はさておき(,はさておき・はさておいて,,"(Leaving or putting) aside, Apart","はさておき is an expression which is often translated as 'leaving aside (A)', or 'apart from (A)'. It is a combination of the adverbial particle は, the conjunction さて 'now' (moving on to a new thing), and the conjunctive form of 置 く 'to place', or 'to leave', 置 き. The more literal 'now putting aside (A)' may also be used. This structure will be used when (A) is a topic that the speaker would like to move away from, in order to discuss something more important. はさておき will primarily directly follow nouns. However, it is also common to see はさておき following a phrase that ends with かどうか. This can be translated as 'disregarding whether it is (A) or not, (B)', and will imply that (B) is a more appropriate topic, so (A) should be moved on from. Caution さて may occasionally appear in either of the kanji forms 扨 , or 扠 . However, this is quite rare. 置 く itself may also be replaced with 措 く 'to set aside'. Fun Fact 冗談 はさておき is a set expression that has the meaning of 'jokes aside', or 'moving on to the serious business'.",N1
始める,はじめる,,"To start, To begin to","To express that actions are beginning or ending in Japanese, the verbs 始 める (to commence), or 終 わる (to end) will need to be used. In this lesson, we will focus on actions that are 'beginning'. To say that (A) is starting/beginning, we will need to attach はじめる to the ます stem of almost any verb. Whether you use the hiragana form, or the kanji form does not matter, as there will be no change in nuance. Due to はじめる being a verb itself, the tense can be changed, to show that something will start, is starting, or has started. Caution It can be easy to accidentally use 始 まる , the intransitive form of this verb. However, with this expression, the transitive form will always be used, due to the verb that はじめる is attached to being the thing that 'is started', by 'something' else.",N4
筈がない,はずがない,,"Hardly possible, Cannot be, Highly unlikely, Improbable","Like はず , coming from the kanji 筈 , which suggests that something is 'bound' to be true, はずがない suggests that something is 'not bound' to be true. This expression is usually translated as 'hardly possible', 'improbable', or 'unlikely', but in reality, it is a bit weaker than these, and translates more literally to '(A) is not the only possibility'. As はずがない (a combination of 筈 , the case-marking particle が , and the い-Adjective ない) is a phrase that starts with a noun, it may be used after any word that could usually connect with a noun. Caution There is a big difference in nuance between ない はず だ 'bound not to', and はずがない 'not bound to'. ない はず strongly negates the (A) statement, and expresses the speaker's opinion that it is almost definitely not true. はずがない on the other hand, simply suggests that (A) being almost 100% true is not the case.",N4
筈だ,はずだ,,"Bound to (be), Expected to (be), Should be (able)","はず , coming from the kanji 筈 , is a word in Japanese that is very similar to 'bound' in English. This means that it expresses something that the speaker is 'quite sure is true', but cannot confirm. The most common translations of はず are 'bound to be (A)', and 'should be (A)'. As はず is a noun, it may be used in any place that a noun would usually be used. It will often be followed by だ , or です . Caution Despite はず sometimes being translated as 'should', this is only when you think that something 'should be true', and cannot be used when making suggestions/giving advice. Due to this, 'bound' is the more accurate translation of 筈 , in almost all situations. Fun Fact The だ (or です ) in はずだ may be omitted. This usually makes はず sound a little less certain, like 'bound to be (A)... probably'. In the same way, speakers may sometimes add はず to the end of their sentences in a similar way to 多分 , in order to show that they are not 100% certain about whether what they just said is accurate or not.",N4
果たして,はたして,,"Wonder if ~ (really)?, Wonder how ~ (actually)?, Sure enough, As expected","果 たして , being the て-form of the う-Verb 果 たす 'to fulfill', or 'to come to fruition', is an expression that is used adverbially to strengthen phrases of speculation. It may be translated as 'I wonder if (A)', 'how actually (A)', or 'how really (A)'. 果 たして will often be seen paired with other structures that indicate speculation, such as だろうか, でしょうか, かな, or かしら; and can be thought of as just emphasizing them further. As this grammar point will be used adverbially, it will primarily appear at the beginning of sentences. In sentences that do not include other speculative grammar patterns such as だろうか, 果 たして will regularly be translated as 'sure enough', or 'as expected'. Fun-fact Coming from the base meaning of 果 たす 'to come to fruition', 果 たして can be thought of as similar to 'in the end' in almost all cases, as it merely expresses the speakers thought process about 'what will' or 'what has' happened 'in the end'. If using this translation to memorize 果 たして , it should also be noted that the nuance of what happens 'in the end' is almost always something that the speaker either expected, or assumed would happen in the first place.",N2
は兎も角,はともかく,,"Setting aside, Apart from","はともかく is an expression which makes use of the adverbial-particle は, and the adverb 兎 も 角 meaning 'to set aside', or 'at any rate'. This structure will be used when the speaker wants to change the topic from (A) to (B), or mention (B) as being something additional on top of (A). はともかく is primarily seen following nouns in their dictionary forms. In many cases, this will be when (A) is something that the speaker thinks is not worth considering, or not worth making an issue out of when (B) is more important. Fun-fact The adverb 兎 も 角 is thought to have come from the Buddhist expression 兎角亀毛 , meaning 'horns on rabbits, fur on turtles', referring to things that do not exist. Although this particular meaning is not widely accepted as being strongly related to the modern meaning of 兎 も 角 , some relation can be drawn between it and English phrases such as '(A) is neither here nor there' in reference to something that is non-existent, or of little importance.",N2
はもちろん,はもちろん,,"Not only but also, Let alone, Not to mention, Of course","はもちろん , or occasionally は 勿論 , is a phrase in Japanese that presents (A) as being something obvious, while (B) should still be considered/mentioned. In this expression, the adverbial particle は presents (A) as being a stand-alone topic, before the adverb もちろん 'naturally' emphasizes that (A) is what it is. After this, the (B) part of the sentence will describe some other factor that is worth mentioning. はもちろん will be used directly after noun (A), before the sentence will go on to discuss noun (B). This construction can be translated as 'not only (A), but (B)', 'not to mention (A), (B)', and other similar English expressions. In many cases, despite (A) being the obvious factor, (B) is being highlighted as sharing similar qualities to (A). This means that in はもちろん sentences, も will almost always be seen after (B). Caution While quite similar in meaning to だけでなく , はもちろん is quite a bit more formal. Due to this, it may sound quite stiff in friendly conversation, unless particularly emphasizing something.",N3
は元より,はもとより,,"Not only... but also, Let alone, Of course,","は 元 より , commonly seen purely in hiragana, is a grammar pattern that indicates 'not only (A), but also (B) ', or 'let alone (A), (B)'. This construction is just a combination of は, the noun 元 'origin', and より. In this way, it is just highlighting that 'even compared to the original fact of (A), (B)'. Often, (A) will be something that is considered obvious, or the most well known information in regard to the topic. はもとより may appear after nouns, or verb phrases that have been nominalized with の or こと. Alternatively, はもとより may be used in structures where it is simply showing that (A) is the base from which (B) is also a fact. Although this may sound similar to the previous meaning, it translates closer to 'from the start, (A) is (B)', or 'by nature, (A) is (B)'. Which meaning is being used will usually be clear in the context of the overall sentence.",N2
は別として,は別として,,"Apart from, (Setting) aside, Whether or, Except for, Save for","は 別 として is a set phrase with the meaning of 'setting aside (A)', 'except for (A)', or 'save for (A)'. This structure combines は, 別 , a noun meaning 'difference', 'separation', or 'distinction', と, and the て-form of する. Due to this combination, the more literal meaning is 'going ahead with (A) as an exception', and just declares that (A) is something that is being completely disregarded before discussing the main point. As は is simply marking the topic in the same way that it usually does, this phrase may be seen after a noun, or any other word that would usually be grouped with は. This frequently includes things like かどうか. It is also fairly common to see the (A) word repeated in both its positive and negated form. This has the nuance of 'whether or not', in the same way as かどうか. Despite this grammar structure being used to essentially remove (A) from what is being discussed, the primary reason for this is that (A) is usually an exception to some particular rule or constant that the speaker wants to highlight. Caution は 別 として may occasionally be replaced by は 別 にして , with little change in overall nuance. The use of と merely sounds more definitive, while に expresses that the speaker is intentionally separating (A).",N2
は言うまでもない,は言うまでもない,,"It goes without saying (that), (It is) needless to say, I don't need to remind you","は 言 うまでもない is a structure that combines the adverbial particle は, the う - Verb 言 う, two (2) additional adverbial particles まで and も, and the い-Adjective ない. This is regularly translated as 'it goes without saying that (A)', or 'it is needless to say (A)', where (A) is whatever comes before は. This expression may be preceded by almost any phrase, but is often emphasized even further by the inclusion of こと (or の), or ということ (or の). Literally, this expression is a combination of the meanings of its individual parts. は - Presents the topic. 言 う - Presents that topic as something that can be said. まで - Presents 'being said' as an extent. も - Emphasizes the extent set by まで. ない - Expresses that extent as not existing. Fun Fact This grammar pattern will often be followed by structures such as が, to add a 'but' nuance.",N3
は～くらいです,は～くらいです,,"About the only, To the extent that","は～くらい です is an expression in Japanese used to convey that '(B) is all that exists within (A)'. As with other grammar points that use くらい, this nuance will be shown in the form of an 'extent'. In は～くらい です , both は and くらい are being used as adverbial particles . This structure is often translated as '(B) is about the extent of (A)'. To use this grammar pattern, (A) will come before は, highlighting the situation, place, thing, or person within which a limit exists. The (B) part of the sentence will then describe what that limit is, followed by くらい です (or だ ). In order to add extra emphasis, のもの or なもの may follow くらい.",N3
は～で有名,～は～で有名,,Is famous for,"In order to describe what certain things/places are famous for, ～は～で 有名 is a common expression that will be used. This construction is made up of the adverbial particle は, the case marking particle で, and 有名 , a noun that may also be used as an な-Adjective . ～は～で有名 is usually translated as '(A) is famous for (B)', but literally means 'with (B), (A) is famous/renowned'. The structure may be broken down in the following way: (A) は - Presents (A) as the topic. (B) で - With (B), in で's use as 'with'. 有名 だ - Is famous. As can be seen from these examples, こと (or の) may precede で 有名 . This is quite common when an entire phrase is being described as the famous aspect of (A), rather than a single word. Caution If 有名 is being used as a な-Adjective , it will appear before the famous thing/place itself. This form will usually be utilized when the speaker wants to give further detail about exactly what (A) is.",N3
は～となっている,～は～となっている,,"It is (has been), Have/has become, Happen to be, Has been established","(A) は (B) となっている is a common expression used to show that '(A) is becoming (B)', or (more commonly) '(A) has become (B)'. This expression will only appear with nouns, or な-Adjectives in their 語幹 (stem form). (A) は (B) となっている is often translated as '(A) happens to be (B)', '(A) has been established as (B)', or 'it has been decided that (A) is (B)'. Let's have a look at some examples, and then how this structure is formed. Despite the different translations, (A) は (B) となっている always has the same meaning, which can be understood as follows: (A) は - (A) is a constant unchanging thing. (B) と - (B) is a result. (coming from the case marking particle と's role in highlighting results.) なっている - (A) is existing in the state 'having arrived at the result of (B)'. Due to this, the literal translation may be thought of as 'it is now that (A) is (B)' in almost all situations. Caution (A) は (B) となっている may be rephrased to (A) は (B) になっている. However, に will remove much of the feeling of a 'result', or 'finality'. Due to this, it will just sound like (A) is becoming (B), but is not necessarily that way yet. Caution In writing, おる is not always considered a 'formal' equivalent of いる, especially in set phrases. となっている is often seen as となっており, instead of となっていて. This is particularly common in news articles.",N3
は～の一つだ,～は～の一つだ,,〜 is one of (many) 〜,"In order to express that something is only one thing from within a larger category, the construction ～は～の 一 つだ will be used. In this expression, (A), the thing that there is one of, will be followed by は . After this, (B) + の 一 つ だ will highlight the broader category to which (A) belongs. In this grammar point, の 一 つ is a standard counter. This means that other counters can and will be used, when they are more appropriate than 一 つ .",N4
は,は,prt,As for... (Highlights sentence topic),"は (pronounced わ) is often considered to be one of the most difficult particles to master in Japanese, alongside が . は marks the topic of the sentence, and describes the whole sentence broadly. However, が primarily marks single actions or statements. We will explore this distinction in more detail when covering が . In many sentences (especially short ones), either は or が would be considered perfectly natural. This depends on whether someone is simply stating something ( は ), or highlighting it especially ( が ). In the first sentence, は broadly describes what the sentence is about (curry). In the second sentence, は again describes the whole sentence being about 'me', but が highlights one specific piece of information (wine being the thing that is hated). Caution は cannot be used to describe things that you are seeing or experiencing 'in the moment' (right now). This is due to 'in the moment' events being considered part of a larger experience (your whole day for example). Caution は has 2 main functions. The first marks the topic of the sentence, the second is used for contrast or making comparisons. Although there are no 'strict' rules for this, when は is used toward (or after) the middle of a sentence, it will usually have the nuance of contrast. In the second sentence, は will give the listener the impression that there is a comparison being made.",N5
場合は,ばあいは,,"In the event of, In the case of","場合 は is a phrase in Japanese that is often translated to 'in the event of (A)', or 'in the case of (A)'. It can be used with almost any type of word, but will require な when following a な-Adjective , or の when following a noun. 場合 by itself is usually translated as 'case', or 'situation'. It is frequently used to highlight a hypothetical situation, or a viewpoint/characteristic of another person. When 場合 は is highlighting a viewpoint/characteristic of another person, this is almost always in contrast/comparison to something that is already being discussed. This is an example of the contrastive nuance of the は particle. Caution In relation to a situation, because 場合 means 'to encounter (A)', it has a nuance of randomness. Due to this, 場合 は will not be used to describe events that regularly occur, or events that can be planned/controlled.",N4
ばいい,ばいい,,"Can, Should, It'd be good if","In contrast to ばよかった , which is used for expressing regret about something that someone wishes had been done, ばいい highlights that the speaker is hoping for a particular result, in relation to something that has not happened yet. This translates as 'It'd be good if (A)'. To use ばいい, add the conjunction particle ば, to the end of any verb, and then attach the い-Adjective , いい . Although ばいい literally means 'if (A), it's good', it can also be used to give advice, and has a meaning that is similar to 'should (A)' in these situations. It is generally quite a soft way of giving advice. Caution ばいい may also be used when making statements about something that the speaker believes is not possible. In these cases, it is regularly paired with のに , and has the nuance of 'despite it being good if it were (A)'. This shows that the speaker thinks that (A) would be good, but is aware that (A) cannot/will not happen for some reason.",N3
ばかりだ(),ばかりだ,,"(Only) continue to, Keep on -ing, More and more","Occasionally, the adverbial particle ばかり is combined with verbs in their attributive form , to show that (A) is the only thing that is occuring. It may also imply that (A) is happening 'more and more', or that 'it keeps on (A)'. This phrase utilizes ばかり's standard meaning of 'only', and combines it with the auxiliary verb だ (or です ). As can be seen with these sentences, this use of ばかり is paired almost exclusively with verbs that describe some form of change (higher/lower, stronger/weaker, better/worse, faster/slower, etc). If the speaker would like to express further information in a (B) part of the sentence, だ will simply get changed to its conjunctive form で, before continuing. Caution This use of ばかり is primarily seen with negative trends. However, this is not a grammatical rule, and positive trends may also sometimes appear with ばかりだ.",N3
ばかりでなく,ばかりでなく,,"Not only…but also, As well as","ばかりでなく is a combination of the adverbial particle ばかり, with the conjugated (and negated) form of the auxiliary verb だ . It can be translated as 'not only (A), (B)', or 'not limited to (A), (B). As ばかり is an adverbial particle , it may be paired with the attributive form of other words. Like all other grammar points that negate だ , several forms may be seen. でなく, でなくて, ではなく, ではなくて , じゃなく, じゃなくて . However, it is important to remember that the addition of the は particle will place further emphasis on ない. Caution ばかりでなく is considered to be the more formal version of だけでなく . This means that だけでなく will appear far more commonly in everyday speech and writing.",N3
ばかりに,ばかりに,,"Simply because, Only because, Just because, Simply on account of","When paired with the case marking particle に , ばかり regularly conveys the meaning of 'simply because', or 'just because'. Literally, this expression means that 'even with just (A), (B) is/was able to occur'. This phrase is regularly paired with the past form of verbs, indicating that something that has already taken place, led to some other result. To use ばかりに , simply attach the expression to the end of any word in its attributive form . It should be noted that this particular grammar pattern has a strong tendency to be used with results that are negative. However, this is not a requirement. A high level of eagerness/enthusiasm can also be expressed when paired with grammar points like たい, or ほしい. Fun Fact As we mention in our ばかり grammar point, one of the more common kanji that ばかり stems from is '許', which means to be 'let off' or 'let through'. It implies a minimum amount of something that is then deemed as 'permissible'. This nuance is kept in ばかりに, as the (A) part of the sentence is being highlighted as that minimum extent of something for which the (often surprising) result of (B) is/was possible. Due to this, translations such as 'even with only/just (A), (B)' are quite similar to ばかりに, so long as it is clear that (A) is surprising. Fun Fact The kanji that is used most frequently for ばかり is the same kanji that is used for 許 す 'to forgive'. In this particular use of 許, it still means 'to let off', or 'to let through', as 'to forgive' quite often has the nuance of letting something through/pass/slide.",N3
ばかり,ばかり,,"Just, Only, Nothing but","When used after verbs followed by the conjunction particle て, or nouns, the adverbial particle ばかり highlights that 'nothing but (A) is being done', or 'only (A) exists'. In relation to verbs, てばかり is often followed by いる, as a modified version of the standard ている. However, adding いる is not a requirement, and the same nuance may be conveyed without it. When a sentence consists of a part (A) and a part (B), ばかり will be followed by either で (with verbs or nouns), or いて (only with verbs). This is when ばかり appears directly before the sentence conjunction point, and other combinations are possible (such as ばかりだから). It should be noted that the で with ばかり here is not the particle で, but the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb, だ . Fun Fact ばかり is rarely seen using kanji, but it originally comes from 許 り (sometimes 計 る). This kanji means 'to let off', or 'to let through', and implies that (A) is the only thing that is being 'permitted' in a specific situation.",N3
ばこそ,～ばこそ,,"Precisely because, Only because, Because, Due to, Only if","ばこそ will be used in a similar way to からこそ, indicating that (A) is the the precise reason for (B). It will be translated as 'precisely because of (A)', or 'it is only due to (A) that (B)'. This pattern is a combination of the conjunction particle ば, and the adverbial particle こそ, which is being used in a similar way to a sentence ending particle in this case. ばこそ may follow almost any word type that has been adjusted into its hypothetical form . However, it will appear as であればこそ when used after nouns or な-Adjectives. In many cases, (A) will be a reason that is difficult to conceive of as what would lead to (B) under normal circumstances, and therefore requires the speaker to emphasize it with こそ. Caution ばこそ is very formal, and a bit old-fashioned, so からこそ will almost always be the preferred choice in modern day Japanese.",N1
ば良かった,ばよかった,,"Should have, I wish, It would have been better to","ばよかった is a common expression used when someone regrets that something has not been/was not done. It is a pairing of the conjunction particle ば , and the past form of the い-Adjective , 良 い (remembering that conjugations of いい use よ, and not い). This construction is often translated to 'I wish I did (A)', or 'I should have done (A)'. ばよかった is used after verbs, so requires the standard ば conjugation, before adding よかった . As ば highlights hypothetical situations, ばよかった literally means that 'it would have been good if (A)', where (A) is the thing that the speaker wishes had happened. Fun Fact This grammar point is in direct contrast to ばいい , the non-past version, which is used to express 'it would be good if (A)'.",N4
ば～程,ば〜ほど,,The more…the more,"ば～ほど is a combination of the conjunction particle ば , and the noun ほど. It is used in a similar way to 'the more ~ the more' in English. Literally, it just highlights that 'if it is (A), then the limit of (A) will be controlled only by its extent'. To use ば～ほど, ば will be paired with the hypothetical form of any verb/ い-Adjective (or noun/ な-Adjective with なら on the end), before the same word will be repeated in its attributive form . After this, a (B) part of the sentence will highlight what the expected result of (A) is. As である (the formal version of だ ) may replace な with な-Adjectives (or なら with nouns), sometimes である will be used instead of な/なら, in regard to both nouns and な-Adjectives . Caution When this expression is used with する verbs, the noun that する is linked to in the ば part of the sentence does not need to be repeated in the ほど part. Fun Fact Sometimes, the ば 'hypothetical' part of the sentence will be omitted altogether, leaving ほど to perform a similar function by itself.",N3
ば,ば,,"If… then, (Conditional)","There are several different ways to express 'if' in Japanese. One of these is through using the conjunction particle ば . ば presents hypothetical situations (possibilities), and pairs with verbs using an う to え sound-change conjugation method on the terminal (last) kana. Let's examine this with a few verbs first. As we can see with these verbs, the final kana will change to an え sound, from its original う (る to れ, う to え, く to け, す to せ, etc.) before adding ば . It is important to practice these, to not get them mixed up with verbs that use れる , and られる . Unlike with these verbs, the base form of する and くる will not change when using ば . To conjugate い-Adjectives with ば , the い will be replaced with けれ, one of the standard い-Adjective conjugation forms. After this, just add ば . For な-Adjectives , and nouns, なら (another standard conjugation form of these words) will be added, before attaching ば . In the negative form (using ない), both the auxiliary verb ない, and the い-Adjective ない will conjugate in the same way. Simply replace い with けれ, and then add ば . Fun Fact The なら in ならば is often used by itself to mean 'if', and is an abbreviation of the classical auxiliary verb なり 'to be'. In its hypothesis form, なり will become ならば . However, なり is very irregularly used by itself in modern Japanese, with なら , and ならば being far more common. Caution So that you do not mix up the conjugation rules for ば , and passive verbs, remember that the last kana of the verb will change to an あ sound, before adding れる with passive verbs. However, this change is to an え sound with ば .",N4
必要がある,ひつようがある,,It is necessary to,"Like が 必要 , 必要 がある is an expression which is used to highlight the 'need' or 'necessity' of something. The primary difference being that 必要 がある highlights the need to 'do (A)', and will therefore be used with verbs (without the need for nominalization). To use 必要 がある , just attach it after the plain form of the verb that you want to highlight the 'need' for. As we can see, this construction is simply the combination of a verb + 必要 (creating a verb modified noun), the case marking particle が , and the う-Verb ある . In this way, it just means 'the need of doing (A) exists'. Naturally, this grammar pattern may also be used negatively, to highlight that there is 'no need to do (A)', or that 'doing (A) is not necessary'.",N4
びる-,びる,,"-like, Looking, Feeling, With an air of, To become","びる , like めく, is a verb that is used exclusively as a suffix . It is a る-Verb, and may be translated as '(A) looking', '(A) seeming', or 'behaving like (A)'. びる is quite formal, and will follow a limited set of expressions. びる will appear after nouns, or occasionally the stem form of い-Adjectives. びる indicates that, according to the speaker, something 'gives off the sense of (A)', and is based on visual information. As it is a descriptive verb, びる will change to びた when linked directly to a second noun. Fun Fact Both びる and めく can be thought of as similar to さ, the structure that pairs with adjectives to create new nouns indicating an extent. This is due to the fact that when びる or めく attach to a word, they turn that word itself into a verb that expresses 'having the feeling of (A)', or 'having gained the feeling of (A)' when used in past tense.",N1
風に~,ふうに,,"~ way, In a way that suggests, Like ~","風 'wind', 'air', commonly appearing as kana, is a suffix in Japanese used to indicate that something is in the style, manner, or method of what comes before it. This use of ふう appears following verbs, and works in the same way as a な-Adjective. This means that it will be followed by に when being used adverbially to further describe something that is being done 'in the way of (A)'. Also, it is common for ふうに to be used after pre-noun adjectival words such as こんな, そんな, and あんな. This just highlights that something is being done 'like this', 'like that', etc. Fun-fact For ease of remembering, coming from the kanji for 風 'wind', ふう can be thought of as similar to English phrases like 'to have an air of (A)', etc. However, this is just a tool for memorization, as the overlap in meaning is not 100%.",N2
振りをする,ふりをする,,"To pretend, To act as if","ふりをする is an expression in Japanese that is used to show that someone is 'pretending to be (A)', 'putting on airs of (A)', or 'acting as if (A)'. This construction comes from a combination of the noun 振 り 'a shake', the adverbial particle を , and する . It can be thought of as meaning 'to give off the impression of (A)', or 'to shake off the impression of (A)'. As ふり itself is a noun, this expression may be used with the attributive form of any other word. Fun Fact The noun 振 り has several different nuances in Japanese, with only one of them being used in this particular expression. That meaning is 'to show a certain behavior pattern on the outside'. Due to this, ふり doesn't specifically mean 'to pretend', just that what is happening on the outside may be different to what is happening within a person (either mentally or physically).",N3
振りに,ぶりに,,"For the first time in, Haven't done for some time","When used as a suffix , the voiced form of 振 り 'style', 振 り will be used to indicate either the way something appears, or some specific lapse of time since the last time something happened. This can be translated as 'for the first time in (A)', or 'haven't done (B) for (A) time'. As ぶり (appearing most often in hiragana) is a suffix , it will be used after nouns. When followed by に, the part (B) portion of the sentence will give more information about what wasn't done for the period of (A). Additionally, ぶり may be followed by の when attached directly to a second noun that is being modified by ぶり. Caution Although it is not incorrect, it may be considered unnatural to use ぶり in situations where the interval of time is not significant, such as with minutes, seconds, and hours.",N2
へ行く,へいく,exp,"To go to, To head toward","へ 行 く is a common construction used when describing a place that someone/something is 'heading'. The particles に and へ are mostly interchangeable, but there is a slight difference in meaning. に has the nuance of 'going to', while へ has the nuance of 'heading to'. In these examples, while they may seem the same at first glance, へ focuses much more on the journey, while に puts more emphasis on the destination. This is true for other uses of に and へ as well. に will always put more focus on the destination of an action, where へ will put more emphasis on the distance traveled/between the origin and destination.",N5
へ,へ,prt,"To, Toward","へ is a particle used when describing a place that someone or something is 'moving toward', or 'in contact with'. In many cases, the particles に and へ are interchangeable, but there is a slight difference in meaning. へ focuses more on the distance/effort required to get between (A) and (B), while に focuses more on the connection between (A) and (B). へ always comes after the noun signifying the destination. In these examples, while they may seem the same at first glance, へ shows that there is a space between (A) and (B), while に puts the emphasis solely on the destination. This is why common expressions such as 'city/country name へ ようこそ' sound very polite. It is like saying 'Welcome, and we acknowledge your journey/effort to get here'. In the TV-show example, this commonly means 'thank you for your effort to watch this particular show, out of all the ones you could have chosen'.",N5
べからず,べからず,,"Do not, Must not, Should not, Cannot (べからざる)","べからず , and べからざる are two formal expressions used to convey the meaning of 'must not (A)', or 'ought not to (A)'. It is a combination of the helper-conjugation form of the auxiliary verb べし, べから, and the classical auxiliary verb ず 'not'. ざる itself is just the helper-conjugation form of ず, meaning that the nuance remains exactly the same. In this way, we can see that the literal meaning of 'ought not (A)' exhibits some sort of moral or logical obligation, as is true for all uses of べき derived patterns. べからず and べからざる will be seen following verbs in their dictionary forms . べからざる will be followed by a noun, indicating that the noun is being modified by the phrase. In modern Japanese, the meanings of both of these grammar patterns have shifted slightly from 'obligation', to simply having a strong nuance of 'don't (A)'. In addition to this, they will almost only ever be used on signs or notices. Caution The べからざる form that combines with nouns is usually only seen in a few set variations. These are 許 す べからざる 'cannot be forgiven', ありう べからざる 'must not exist' (impossible), and 欠 く べからざる 'must not be without'.",N1
べきではない,べきではない,,"Should not, Must not , Ought not to","As an extension of the auxiliary verb べき , that is partnered with verbs to convey 'ought to do (A)', べきではない (or べきじゃない) highlights the opposite, and means 'ought not to (A)', 'should not (A)', or 'must not (A)'. Just like べき , it is quite strong, and implies that doing (A) would be considered improper/incorrect. べきではない (or べきじゃない) will be paired with the plain (non-past) form of a verb. Caution As with all other structures that use では, は may be omitted. However, as the presence of は strengthens the ない, the overall phrase will sound a little bit weaker without it. Fun Fact The combination of する and べき is a rare grammatical exception in Japanese, in which two forms are both considered equally correct. Due to this, either するべき, or すべき may be used.",N3
べき,べき,,"Must, Should , Ought to","The auxiliary verb べき , being the attributive form of べし, is a structure in Japanese that is often paired with verbs to express that something 'ought to be done'. It implies some sort of moral obligation, or that (A) is the only reasonable course of action. This comes from the kanji 可 き, which carries the meaning of being something 'permissible' (indicating that any other action would not be acceptable). べき will be paired with the plain (non-past) form of a verb, before being followed by either だ , or another noun. べき is also sometimes translated as 'must do (A)', or 'should do (A)' but it is important to remember that it will always have the nuance of being the only 'permissible' choice, and is therefore very strong. Caution It is important to note that the verb appearing with べき cannot be in past tense, and you will need to use だった or でした after べき , if you would like to say that something 'ought to have been done' in the past. Fun Fact In modern Japanese, there are only 18 auxiliary verbs , of which べき is not one. べし (the standard form) is considered to be a classical auxiliary verb . Due to this, べき (and べし) are often referred to as classical auxiliary verbs . Fun Fact The combination of する and べき is a rare grammatical exception in Japanese, in which two forms are both considered equally correct. Due to this, either するべき, or すべき may be used.",N3
べくして,べくして,,"As expected, Meant to, Supposed to, Destined to, Sure to","べくして is a combination of the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb べし, べく, and the conjunctive particle して, which shows a situation from which a logical determination can be made, or will be a natural course of action. べく itself indicates the word that it is attached to as a 'purpose' or 'end goal'. べくして is often translated simply as 'as expected of (A), (B)', or 'as was supposed to (A), (B)'. (A) and (B) will be the same verb repeated. The literal meaning of 'as determined with the purpose of (A)' may also be used if it helps to remember the nuance. This expression is quite formal, so will rarely be heard in daily speech. Fun Fact As mentioned in other grammar patterns that contain variations of べく such as べき and べし, this structure derives from the kanji 可 , which is usually translated as 'permissible' or 'allowed'. All 可 really indicates is a situation that does not currently exist, but it certain to come about as a part of the most logical course of events.",N1
べくもない,べくもない,,"No (doubt or hope), There is no way, It is impossible, Not a hope in hell","As mentioned in the several other grammar structures that include べく,  this structure is the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb べし ‘shall’. It will be attached to the dictionary form of verbs in order to convey the purpose, necessity, or likelihood of an action. When combined with the adverbial particle も, and the い-Adjective ない, it is often translated as ‘it is impossible to (A)’, or ‘there is no way to (A)’. べくもない is a pattern that usually appears with verbs highlighting the thinking or emotions of the speaker, and how that action is impossible or inconceivable for them. Caution In the case of する, べく may be connected directly to する, or to the stem, す.",N1
べく,べく,,"For the purpose of, In order to, To ensure","As the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb べし, べく will be attached to the dictionary form of verbs in order to convey the purpose of an action. This will be translated as 'for the purpose of (A), (B)', 'in order to (A), (B)', or 'to ensure that (A), (B)'. べく itself will only attach to verbs that can be done intentionally, with some purpose in mind. The (B) part of べく sentences will also indicate an intentional action that will be performed in order to reach the goal of (A). When combining する with べく , due to べく being a classical auxiliary verb , it will attach to the classical stem of する, す. However, in modern Japanese it is fairly common to see both すべく and するべく , with both forms being considered correct. べく itself is a very formal structure in modern Japanese, so will rarely be used in standard speech. Fun Fact Although べし and all of its conjugations have slightly different translations based on the grammar points that they appear in, the underlying meaning can be stemmed from the originating kanji 可 し, meaning 'to be permissible'. The focus with this kanji and all forms of べし are just that the word it is attached to is being marked as a strong goal. This means that rather than 'in order to (A)', べく is closer to 'to attain (A)', in that it adds further emphasis.",N1
他に,ほかに(も)・ほか(に)は,,"Other, Another, Any other, Anything else, As well as, Besides, In addition","他 に is regularly considered to be one of the more difficult structures to master in Japanese, so let's take a thorough look at it. Basically, 他 by itself just means 'another', or 'other'. に highlights 他 'another thing' as being the target of what comes next in any particular sentence. The possibilities are as follows: 他 に - Another thing. 他 に （ も ） - Even another thing (sounds less certain). 他 に （ は ） - Was there another thing (focuses on something pre-existing, which someone may have forgotten). 他 の + Noun - Another 'specific thing'. 他 に （ は ） may be used in either positive or negative sentences, but it tends to appear in negative sentences more often. Caution Because 他 に （ も ） focuses on the 'addition' of another thing, it cannot be used in negative sentences (with the exception of questions). The reason this is acceptable in questions, but not statements, is due to the 'isn't it?' meaning that negative questions can have in Japanese (just like English). It is the equivalent of the following: この 他 にも ない - In addition to this, there is also nothing (sounds strange in English!) その 他 にも ないか - In addition to that, is there nothing else? (sounds normal in English!)",N4
殆ど,ほとんど,,"Almost all, Most, Hardly any, Few (Adverbial noun)","The adverb ほとんど is used in many situations in Japanese, and often translates as 'most', 'hardly any', 'almost all', and similar expressions. The nuance will always depend on the rest of the sentence. The most accurate translation for the word ほとんど itself is simply 'almost', where the thing that it is describing is always considered to be a full group, rather than a single thing. As with many other adverbs that highlight an 'amount' in Japanese, ほとんど can modify a whole phrase, or can be used before の , to further specify a single noun. In negative sentences, ほとんど translates as 'hardly any'. This is mainly due to the 'full group' that ほとんど is describing being highlighted as almost 'not' existing.",N4
程～ない,ほど～ない,,"Is not as…as, Isn't... like..., Not to the extent of...","Another expression that uses the noun ほど 'an extent' in Japanese, is ほど～ない . In the (A) part of a sentence, an extent will be highlighted, before the (B) part of the sentence will use ない to negate that extent, saying that it has not been reached. This phrase can be translated as 'it isn't like (A)', 'it's not to the point of (A)'. Literally it means 'if (A) is the extent, then (B) is not true'. ほど will regularly be used after a verb or noun, while ない is more likely to be used after a verb, い-Adjective , or な-Adjective (as it is describing something about ほど). While this grammar point may be used for expressing that an extent has not been reached, it is also frequently used for making comparisons between two things. In these cases, it states that 'the example/limit of (A) is something that cannot be reached/repeated by (B)'. This is similar to '(B) is not as ~ as (A)' in English.",N3
程,ほど,,"The more, About, To the extent that, So much… that","ほど, coming from the kanji 程 'an extent', is used for describing rough estimates about the 'amount' of something. However, unlike expressions such as くらい (which focuses more on the speaker's uncertainty about the exact number), ほど puts emphasis on the upper (or lower) limit of something as having been 'reached'. Due to this, it is usually translated as 'so much that (A)', or 'to the extent that (A)'. ほど can be added on to the end of the attributive form of any word. The attributive form being the form that is able to be partnered directly with nouns. Caution Although くらい may be used to describe something that is 'around' a certain extent (regardless of whether it is above or below that extent), 程 refers specifically to the 'limit' of something, and therefore cannot be used to describe something that exceeds the stated limit. Due to this, it is regularly used to express some sort of exaggerated limit of (A), when the real extent is far below that.",N3
毎～の様に,まい～のように,,"Almost every ~, Nearly every ~, On a ~ basis","In a similar way to のように , まい～のように states that something is happening 'in the manner/way of (A)'. まい means 'every' (coming from the kanji 毎 ), and will always be followed by (A). (A) being a word that expresses some kind of measurement (usually time). まい～のように is often translated as 'almost every (A)', 'nearly every (A)', or 'on an (A) basis'. Because よう (from the kanji 様 ) usually expresses the 'manner' in which something is existing/happening, this phrase literally highlights that something occurs 'in the manner of every (A)', and is therefore up to the interpretation of the listener as to whether the speaker means 'every', or 'almost every'. Caution Although みたいに and のように are regularly interchangeable, that is not the case with まい～のように . This is because みたいだ is originally an abbreviation of the more formal phrase を 見た ような , and therefore can sound unnatural when used to describe things that cannot be seen, like time.",N4
まい',まい,,"Won't, Intend not to, Probably not","The auxiliary verb まい is used in Japanese to express negative volition. This means that in many ways, it is the opposite of う and よう, which are the auxiliary verbs that express positive volition. まい connects to the base form of verbs, and is considered slightly formal. まい may be translated as 'won't (A)', 'to intend not to (A)', or 'probably not (A)'. It can be considered as a condensed way of expressing ～ないだろう. Caution When appearing with する or 来 る, it is also common to see まい connected to the conjunctive form as しまい , すまい , きまい and こまい . However, the standard するまい and 来 るまい are also quite common structures.",N2
前に,まえに,exp,"Before, In front of","前 に is used when describing something that is either 'before something' (in time), or 'in front of something' (a location). It is used with verbs (in their non-past form), or nouns. When used with nouns, の is required before 前 に . Caution Another similar construction to 前 に is 手前 に . 前 に can be used for something that is in front of any location. However, 手前 に may only be used when things in front of you (or someone/something else) are being described physically.",N5
捲る,まくる,,"Like crazy, Keep doing (without a second thought), Nothing but, On and on, Do … all around, To do a lot of, One after another, All over, Keep, Everything, Constantly, All the time","まくる is a verb that will be attached to the conjunctive form of other verbs in order to show that (A) is being done over and over, a lot, or with a great amount of vigor. It comes from the verb う-Verb 捲 る 'to roll', or 'to turn', so means 'to do (A) around and again'. Common translations include 'to (A) like crazy', 'to do nothing but (A)', and 'to constantly do (A)'. As mentioned, this structure will attach to the conjunctive form of other verbs. This structure may be used both in positive or negative contexts, and it is quite common for the nuance of まくる to indicate that (A) is being done recklessly, or with abandon. This implies that the speaker isn't thinking about the consequences of doing (A) repeatedly, if any may exist. Caution The (A) verb must be something that is volitional, meaning that the speaker must have control over it and its repetition.",N1
まさか,まさか,,"I never dreamed, Never, No way, Don't tell me, You don't say","Almost always written purely in hiragana, まさか is a combination of まさ, a noun meaning 'precise', or 'exact', and the adverbial particle か. In modern Japanese, まさか is thought of as a single adverb meaning 'it can't be true', 'no way', or 'don't tell me'. As it is treated primarily as an adverb, まさか will most often appear at the beginning of a sentence, before some statement about what the speaker is shocked/surprised about. Fun Fact まさ comes from 正 , meaning 'precise' or 'actual'. However, this noun is very rarely used in modern Japanese. まさに is an adverb used to mean 'precisely', while まさか is another adverb used to mean 'no way!'. However, the literal meaning of まさか is closer to 'is it true?', or 'is it actually?', due to か's role in creating questions.",N3
ましょうか,～ましょうか,exp,"Shall we, Shall I","As covered in our ましょう lesson, ましょう is one of the conjugations of the auxiliary verb ます, and is a common (polite) way to suggest that something be done 'together'. Adding the particle か to this expression simply changes the nuance from 'let's', to 'shall we?', and is more of a direct question than ましょう by itself. Like ましょう , this expression can be added to the ます stem form of any verb. One thing to note with these examples is that they are 'suggestions', not 'invitations'. In Japanese there is a slight difference between the two, in the same way that there is in English. If you want to invite someone to do something, the most natural way would be to use ませんか , a phrase that is similar to ましょうか . The difference here is that 'won't you do (A)?' has a stronger nuance of being a direct invitation, while ましょうか is closer to just 'let's do (A)!'",N5
ましょう,ましょう,aux-v,"Let's, Shall we (Polite volitional)","ましょう is one of the conjugations of the auxiliary verb ます, and is a common (polite) way to suggest that something be done 'together' (when used with a verb). It is often translated as 'let's (A)', or 'shall we (A)?'. To use ましょう , we will simply need to change ます to ましょう , when conjugating the verb. Despite regularly being translated as 'shall we (A)?', ましょう does not specifically target another person, and can also be used as a declaration that (A) will be done/needs to be done. This use reflects the base meaning of ましょう , which is the polite volitional form (deliberately/purposefully doing something). In this example, the speaker is expressing to themselves that they 'will' do something, and are strongly resolved to make it happen (similar to 'I shall' in English).",N5
まじき,まじき,,"Unbecoming of, Unworthy of, Not proper for, Should not, Must not, Cannot","まじき is the attributive form of まじ, a classical auxiliary verb that has been replaced almost entirely by まい 'must not', 'should not' in modern Japanese. まじ itself has this same meaning of 'must not', and will only be seen in a very limited number of formal expressions. Although slightly different in nuance, まじき is often translated simply as 'not proper for (A)', or 'unbecoming of (A)' in each case. The most common pattern that まじき will be seen in is (A) にあるまじき (B), where the case-marking particle に follows a noun, then is linked to the う-Verb ある, before まじき will connect to a second noun. Occasionally, に will be replaced by として 'as', with the rest of the structure remaining the same. 許 すまじき 'must not be forgiven', or simply 'unforgivable' is another pattern that may be seen.",N1
益々,ますます,,"Increasingly, More and more, Decreasingly, Less and less, Keep -ing","When using the adverb ますます , it will have the meaning of 'increasingly', 'more and more', or even 'to keep (A)ing'. It is used to emphasize continuous trends, and will regularly be seen at the beginning of a sentence. Occasionally, the kanji form 益々 will be used. This will not change the nuance at all. The kanji 益 simply means 'gain'. Fun Fact Despite sometimes being seen as 益々 , this expression originally comes from the stacking of 増 す, an う - Verb meaning 'to increase'. Due to this, ますます is most often used to highlight verbs that indicate some sort of change, or with adjectives that can increase in intensity. Caution ますます is sometimes translated as 'less and less', but this situation is still actually considered as 'increasing' (increasingly negative).",N3
まず,まず,,"To start with, Firstly","Like many other adverbs in Japanese, まず can be used to modify a whole phrase/sentence. This means that it will regularly appear at the beginning of a statement. まず is associated with kanji 先 and therefore carries the meaning of 'first', or 'starting with'. まず is regularly used when you want to convey that something 'should' be done before anything else/discussed first, and not when something is first in rank. In this kind of sentence, it would be far more natural to use a statement like 一番 , 最初 or 一位 if discussing rank. Caution When using まず , it can sound like you are giving someone advice, so be careful to use polite language, or perhaps と 思 う to show that the suggestion is just an opinion.",N4
ませんか,ませんか,exp,"Won't you, Would you not, Why don't we","ませんか (or ないか more casually) is an expression that is used after verbs as an invitation. It basically translates to 'won't you do (A) with me?'. This expression is a little bit different to ましょうか , in that it sounds directly like an invitation to do (A). ましょうか tends to sound more like a suggestion that (A) should be done. It is recommended to use the ませんか version, as ないか would be a bit too casual to use with someone that you are not very close with (and is also technically not correct Japanese). To make it clearer that the speaker wants to do (A) 'with' someone, expressions like 一緒 に 'together' are often added, for clarification. To examine the difference between ましょうか and ませんか , let's have a look at how the nuance changes in the same type of sentence. Here, ませんか will come across as an invitation due to the fact that you are asking the person if they 'wouldn't mind doing (A)' with you. This is the main reason that it is considered a more polite option when inviting someone to do something, than ましょうか .",N5
また,また,,"Also, As well, Moreover, Again, Additionally","また , or 又 in its kanji form, is an expression which means 'again', 'additionally', 'also', or 'moreover'. This may seem confusing at first, but it may be easier to think of また as meaning 'repetition of (A)', where (A) is any particular course of action. This repetition is a bit different to English, in that it can express the same action, or an alternative option. また can be used as an adverb , or as a conjunction . In this lesson, we will focus on its use as a conjunction. As with many other conjunctions in Japanese, a phrase/sentence can begin with また , so long as that sentence expresses a complete thought. Due to また being quite different to any single word that we have in English, let's try to make the meaning a bit clearer. Imagine that '(A) action always has (B) result'. However, the action which leads to the (B) result could be many different things. Because of this, また can have the following meanings. The same (A) action is taken - Has the nuance of 'again', or 'moreover'. A different (A) action is taken - Has the nuance of 'also', and 'additionally'.",N4
まだ～ていません,まだ～ていません,exp,Still haven't done (something),"まだ～ていません is a regular expression that combines the adverb まだ, with the conjunction particle て . The て form will be followed by the verb いる in its negative いません (polite), or いない (casual) form. This expression has the meaning of 'to still not have done (A)'. From these examples, it can be seen that this grammatical structure follows the regular rules of conjugation for the て form.",N5
まだ,まだ,adv,"Still, Not yet","In English, まだ is regularly translated as 'still', or 'not yet', depending on if it is used in a positive non-past, or negative sentence. The reason that Japanese only requires one word for both of these nuances is due to まだ literally meaning 'something is unexpectedly still going'. From these sentences, we can see that まだ may be translated in each case as the following. (Non-past) - Although (A) is expected to not be there/happening, it is. 'Still' in English. (ている) - Although (A) is expected to not still be going, it is. 'Not yet' in English. The negative form of this will be discussed more in まだ～ていません . This is the opposite of もう , which means 'something is unexpectedly finished'. まだ may also be used to ask questions. This is when the speaker thinks that something 'might' be continuing, but wants or needs to confirm. Fun Fact まだ is often used simply as an expression indicating that something is 'lacking', or 'not yet' where it needs to be. In these cases まだ is frequently repeated as まだまだ, for emphasis.",N5
までに,までに,,"By ~, By the time that ~, Before ~","までに is a combination of two different types of particles. The adverbial particle まで , and the case marking particle に . までに is verb similar to まで when it means 'until'. However, there is one very important distinction. This distinction is that までに means 'by', not 'until'. To use までに , we will need to attach it to the end of a noun, or verb in the non-past form. To understand the difference between まで , and までに , we need to remember that に usually marks a 'target', or a 'destination' for where something will happen. In this case, まで is the 'target' that に is marking. This is due to the fact that まで means 'as far as' ( まで is sometimes written using kanji 迄 , especially in older/formal texts, and newspapers). In this way, までに more literally means '(A) as far as ( に marks the target), (B). Fun Fact Originally, まで meant 'as far as' in regard to the passing of a particular event. However, in modern Japanese, most people will assume that the speaker means 'by the beginning of (A)'. Due to this, sentences that have a very broad event, such as 夏 までに could actually be interpreted as 'by the start of summer', or 'before the end of summer', depending on who you are talking to. In these cases, it would be better to add a more specific time frame.",N4
までもない,までもない,,"There is no need to, Do not have to, It is not necessary to, Needless to","までもない is a grammar pattern that consists of the particle まで 'until', the adverbial particle も, and ない 'there is not'. This structure will primarily be seen with a translation similar to 'there is no need to (A)', or 'it is not necessary to (A)'. However, a more literal translation of 'it is not so far as to (A)' is also completely acceptable, and still carries the correct nuance. までもない will be used following verbs in their dictionary form , and may or may not have a part (B) explaining why (A) is not necessary. As can be assumed by the use of まで, the primary nuance of までもない is that while there may be some sort of slight issue or problem, the speaker does not consider it as being something that has reached a point that is worth being concerned about. It may also indicate that because something is obvious, it does not need to be confirmed, etc. Caution When coming between an (A) and a (B) phrase, the conjunctive form までもなく will be used, but this is less common.",N1
までも,まで,,"Even, To even, To the extent of","The adverbial particle まで is used in the same way as many other adverbial particles, in that it is highlighting that the statement that comes after it as important in some way. However, unlike our first look at まで , which discussed its use as 'until', this use of まで has the nuance of 'even', or 'to the extent'. It can be used after verbs or nouns. Although using まで as 'even' may seem different to 'until', they are essentially the same thing in Japanese. This is because まで always means '(A) まで , (B)', where (A) is the 'limitation/extent', and (B) is the 'noteworthy factor'. This 'noteworthy factor' will usually be a descriptive word/phrase, such as a verb, adjective, or explanation. Fun Fact The も particle is sometimes grouped together with まで , when the meaning is 'even'. This just adds emphasis to the fact that the event is somewhat surprising, or that the result is satisfying.",N4
ままに,まま(に),,"As (one likes, feels or pleases), Spur of the moment, Wherever one fancies, Spontaneously, On a whim","Unlike the ままに that is partnered with passive structures like れる and られる 'to do as one is told', when paired with verbs in their standard forms , ままに means 'to do (A) as one wishes', or 'to do (A) on a whim'. ままに is a combination of the noun まま 'as is', and the case marking particle に. ままに will follow verbs in their dictionary form . In many cases, this use of ままに indicates that the speaker or doer is letting the action of (A) happen in whatever way is most natural, and is not making any particular effort to control the outcome. Due to this, there are only a limited number of verbs that are commonly used with ままに , and it is best not to attempt to use combinations that you have not come across before. Some standard sequences are 気 の 向 くままに 'in whatever way my attention is inclined', 思 うままに 'in whatever way I think up', 思 いつくままに 'in whatever way I come up with', 足 の 向 くままに 'in whatever direction my feet are pointed', 赴 くままに 'in whatever way it proceeds', 欲 するままに 'in whatever way is desired', and 風 の 吹 くままに 'in whatever way the wind blows'.",N1
ままに,まま(に),,"As is, While remaining, Left in a state","まま , coming from the kanji 儘 , which means 'as it is', is a noun in Japanese that is used for describing the 'unchanged state' of something. This expression may be translated as 'while remaining (A)', 'as (A) is', or 'left in the state of (A)'. It can be used after any word in its attributive form . However, when used with verbs, it has a tendency to be used with the た (past) form most frequently. まま often expresses that something should be left alone, or undisturbed. This is generally seen with verbs in the ない form. Caution While まま may be followed by the case marking particle に , it is very often omitted. When it appears, however, it will place extra emphasis on the next verb in the sentence. Fun Fact まま may sometimes be pronounced as まんま . However, this variation is primarily only used in casual speech, or writing that is being made to sound like casual speech.",N3
まるで～様だ,まるで…ようだ,,"It is entirely as if, It is just as though","まるで～ようだ is an expression in Japanese that combines the adverb まるで (sometimes written as 丸 で), and combines it with a description of (A) followed by the auxiliary verb よう (with or without either だ or です after it). 丸 で can be translated as 'entirely', or 'completely', while the whole expression may be understood as 'it seems entirely as though (A)'. まるで will be used at the beginning of a sentence, before the description of what (A) seems to be like. Instead of ようだ , other expressions of conjecture may also be used, such as みたい . Caution The 'as if' or 'as though' nuance of まるで～ようだ comes primarily from either ようだ , or みたいだ , with まるで simply meaning 'entirely', or 'completely' in almost all situations.",N3
みたいに,みたいに・みたいな,,"Like, Similar to, Resembling","As learned in our previous lesson about みたい , it is a な-Adjective . This means that it can be used in conjunction with nouns, or with verbs. In each of these cases, it will carry the meaning of 'like (A)', or 'resembling (A)'. The difference between みたい describing a verb or a noun can be identified by whether it is followed by な (describes a noun), or に (describes a verb). Let's take a look at some examples. This difference is important to know, as (B), the thing that みたい is describing, does not always come directly after みたい . In the second example sentence, we can see that 泳 ぐ (the verb that に is linked to), does not actually come until later in the sentence. This is quite a regular occurrence, especially in longer passages. Caution Despite みたい meaning 'to resemble', and being based on (usually) visual stimulus, it should not be confused with 見 たい 'to want to see'. This is a common mistake that learners make, as みたい itself does not have a kanji form.",N4
みたい,みたい,,"Like, Similar to, Resembling","In Japanese, there are many ways to express that something happens in a way that is 'like' something else, or 'resembles' something else. One of these ways is through the use of the な-Adjective , みたい . みたい can be used after any word that a な-Adjective would usually follow, to express that something is 'like (A)', or 'similar to (A)'. In the above examples, we can see that みたい should always be followed by だ (or です ) when it is at the end of a statement, however, this is frequently omitted. みたい is also often used to describe another noun, but needs to be followed by な in these cases. In this type of sentence, it is just expressing that something is '(B), but resembles (A)'. みたい is used most often in conversational situations, and is based on direct, reliable information. It is far less formal than its counterpart, ようだ . Caution Despite みたい meaning 'to resemble', and being based on (usually) visual stimulus, it should not be confused with 見 たい 'to want to see'. This is a common mistake that learners make, as みたい itself does not have a kanji form. Fun Fact みたいだ is originally an abbreviation of the more formal phrase を見た ような . As a result of this, we can see that ようだ kept its formal meaning, while みたい became the casual equivalent.",N4
味~,み,,"~ness, Used to indicate conditions or nature","み is a common suffix in Japanese that has the role of transforming adjectives into nouns. This is often translated as '(A)ness' in English, but has a few small differences. To use み, attach it to the stem form of either い-Adjectives or な-Adjectives . The 語幹 (stem form) being the form with い removed (for い-Adjectives ), or な removed (for な-Adjectives ). Caution み's differences from ~ness are as follows. み is used to highlight the 'condition', or 'place' in which something exists in a constant state. Therefore, it will not be used to highlight varying degrees of ~ness, only innate qualities that are not being specifically measured. In addition to this, み is sometimes used directly as a substitute for 味 , the kanji meaning 'taste'. In these cases, み tends to describe a quality of something that can be sensed (such as taste or color).",N3
むしろ,むしろ,,"Rather, Instead, Over","When a speaker is making a determination about something in Japanese, the adverb むしろ is often used to express a more accurate depiction of what has already been said. This is regularly translated as 'rather', or 'instead'. むしろ will mostly appear at the beginning of new sentences, or the beginning of a second clause within a sentence, before information about (A) will be clarified. As むしろ seeks to give a more accurate description about something, it will often be paired with grammar patterns such as より, to show where the comparison is being made. Fun Fact むしろ comes from the kanji 寧 ろ, literally meaning 'preferable'. This is the same kanji that appears in the word 丁寧 , meaning 'polite' (sometimes also translated as 'careful'). The grammar structure むしろ itself may even be translated as 'preferably', simply expressing that careful consideration has been given to describing something accurately.",N3
めく,めく・めいた,,"Like, To show signs of,  To have the appearance of, To come to a (state) similar to, Somewhat, An air of,  Feels almost like","めく is a fairly unique う-Verb in Japanese in that it will only be used as a suffix . This is due to its meaning of 'to show signs of (A)', or 'to have the appearance of (A)'. It will be attached to nouns that the speaker experiences to be the case. As めく itself is a verb, it may appear in several different conjugation forms depending on how it is describing the rest of the sentence. When connected directly to a second noun, the past-tense form めいた is most common. This 'that the speaker experiences to be the case' part is important, as めく will almost always highlight the speaker's own personal feelings in regard to (A), and how they perceive it. The thing being described as (A) will usually not actually be (A), and the speaker is often aware of this fact. Caution めく is mostly used with set nouns, so it is best to only use it with expressions that you have already heard. Some examples are 謎 めく 'to appear to be a riddle', 皮肉 めく 'to appear to be sarcastic', 言 い 訳 めく 'to appear to be an excuse', 作 り 物 めく 'to appear to be fictitious', and seasons of the year.",N1
滅多に〜ない,めったに〜ない,,"Hardly, Rarely, Seldom","めったに～ない is an expression that may be translated as 'hardly', 'seldom', or 'rarely'. Originally, 滅多 is a な-Adjective that means 'thoughtless', or 'reckless'. Due to this, as an adverb , 滅多 に literally means 'thoughtlessly' or 'recklessly'. めったに～ない will usually be paired with a verb in the negative form, or following a noun, and the adverbial particle は. Caution It is far more common to see めったに written without kanji, than with. However, both are used. Fun Fact As めったに originally means 'thoughtlessly', when appearing in a negative statement, the nuance becomes 'to not (A) thoughtlessly' (mindlessly, or aimlessly). This simply expresses that the speaker will not do (A) unintentionally, or (A) will not happen unless there is some special reason for it.",N3
もう,もう,adv,"Already, Anymore","In English, もう is regularly translated to 'already', or 'anymore', depending on if it is used in a positive-past (already), or negative (anymore) sentence. The reason that Japanese only requires one word for both of these nuances is due to もう literally meaning 'something has unexpectedly ended'. From these sentences we can see that もう can be translated in each case as the following. (Past) - Although expected to not be done, it is. 'Already', in English. (Negative) - Although expected to still be going, it isn't. 'Anymore', in English. This is the opposite of まだ , which means 'something is unexpectedly still going'. もう may also be used to ask questions. This is when the speaker thinks that something 'might' have ended, but wants to confirm. Fun Fact もう is often used simply as an expression of exasperation (giving up on arguing), to show that someone has already reached the point of not wanting to continue.",N5
も構わず,も構わず,,Without worrying about,"も 構 わず is an expression that combines も, the う-Verb 構 う 'to mind', or 'to care', and the literary auxiliary verb ず, which connects to verbs in the same way, and has the same meaning as ない. Common translations for this pattern include 'without worrying about (A), (B)', and 'without minding (A), (B)'. This structure is seen with verbs, い-Adjectives, and な-Adjectives followed by の, but may also follow nouns without the addition of の. Occasionally, にも may be used instead of も for further emphasis. も 構 わず is used most frequently to express that (A) is something that is either being ignored or that the speaker is not worried about. The (B) part of the statement will regularly highlight something that is being without any consideration for (A). This comes from the standard 'to brace', or 'to give pause' meaning of 構 う.",N2
もさることながら,もさることながら,,"It is a fact that, But, Even more than, It goes without saying, Not only but also,","もさることながら is a construction in Japanese that is often translated as 'it goes without saying that (A), but (B)', or 'not only (A), but (B) too'. This expression is a combination of the adverbial particle も, the pre-noun adjectival さる 'particular', or 'certain', the noun 事 'thing', and the conjunction particle ながら 'while'. Due to this, the more literal translation is simply 'while (A) is also of particular merit, (B)'. This literal translation will be helpful to remember, as もさることながら will always present (A) as important, but (B) as even more important than that. もさることながら will be attached to the end of nouns and noun phrases. As (B) is being emphasized in sentences that use this grammar structure, it is common to see other expressions of emphasis combined with もさることながら . Some examples include さらに 'additionally', なにより 'more than anything', and 以上 'above that'.",N1
もしかしたら,もしかしたら,,"Perhaps, Maybe, Possibly","もしかしたら and its alternatives are usually treated as stand alone 副詞 (adverbs) in Japanese that are used to present hypothetical situations, and what could happen within those situations. These expressions are a combination of the adverb 若 し, the case marking particle か, and one of several combinations of する (したら, して, or すると). It is often translated as 'perhaps', 'maybe', or 'possibly'. As with many other Japanese adverbs, it will often appear at the beginning of sentences. Due to もしかしたら presenting hypothetical situations, かもしれない will regularly appear in the same sentence (although it is not required). As もしかしたら is a combination of もし 'if', か (presents a question), and したら 'so happens that', the literal translation is close to 'does it so happen that', or 'should it so happen that', with past or present tense being controlled more so by the following statement.",N3
もしも～なら,もしも～なら・もしも～でも,,"If, Supposing","もし も is an adverb in Japanese that strengthens the base meaning of もし 'a bit'. Therefore, the literal meaning of もし も is 'even a bit'. Despite this, as もし and もし も are almost exclusively paired with sentences that use some sort of assumption , or 'hypothesis' based expression, もし も will often be translated as 'supposing that'. もし も will be used at the beginning of sentences that include almost any form of hypothesis expression. For example, ば , と , なら , or ても. Although もし も is considered a stand-alone adverb, it is just a combination of もし , and the adverbial particle も. Caution もし and もし も are most often used to express some type of result. This means that (B) will happen if (A) happens, or if (A) is true. However, たとえ is contrastive, and therefore asks 'what the result' of a specific situation may be.",N3
もし,もし,,If (For emphasis),"もし is an adverb used to emphasize the nuance of 'if', with expressions like と , ば , なら , たら , and ても . Literally, the meaning of もし is close to 'while slight', or 'while small'. To use もし , simply add it to the beginning of any phrase that uses one of the conditional expressions listed above. Fun Fact もし is sometimes seen written as 若 し , a kanji which has the meaning of 'low in (A)', (also seen in the word 若 い 'young'). It is from this kanji that もし gets its meaning of 'while low in (probability, number, age, experience)'.",N4
尤も,もっとも,,"Although, But, However, For all that, Provided that","もっとも , sometimes also seen as 尤 も, is a conjunction that is used to clarify when (A) is not the only important thing to be considered. This expression is usually translated as 'although'. However, 'for all that', or 'with that said' are also accurate translations, depending on the context. Let's look at a few examples. Due to もっとも offering clarification about something, the (B) phrase will often end with が, けど, けれども , and other similar expressions. When もっとも is used, the speaker is agreeing that (A) is true, but not the whole picture. As a noun itself, 尤 も can be described as 道理に 適 う, which means 'to stand to reason'. This nuance is kept, and may also be used as an accurate translation for もっとも as a conjunction.",N3
ものか,ものか,,"Definitely not, Absolutely not, Impossible, Do you really think~?","ものか is a set expression in Japanese that is used to strongly suggest that the previous statement absolutely will not happen, or is definitely not true. It is a combination of the noun もの 'thing', and the adverbial particle use of か for conveying 'doubt' or 'uncertainty'. Common translations include 'definitely not (A)', 'absolutely not (A)', and 'do you really think that (A)'. Literally, the meaning is quite close to 'as if' in English, as ものか just poses a strong question to which the speaker already completely disagrees with. ものか may appear after any word that could attach to もの, such as a verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns followed by な. Other forms which may be seen are もんか , もんですか , and ものですか , with women being more traditionally likely to use the もんですか and ものですか variants. Additionally, when following the た form of verbs, ものか will imply that the speaker cannot bear for (A) to eventuate, due to evaluating it as something highly negative. Caution There are several other situations in where ものか will be used, but in each of them it may be easiest to think of the primary translation as being 'as if (A)', as it merely implies the speakers shock or disbelief in relation to whatever conditions are presented in the previous statement. These 'conditions' may involve an amount, possibility, or result of (A).",N2
ものがある,ものがある,,"Strong judgement, There is something, Feel strongly that","ものがある is an interesting grammar structure in Japanese that is used to declare that something has a particular trait of (A), according to the speaker's subjective opinion. Often, ものがある is translated as 'I feel strongly that (A)', or 'there is something (A) about (B)'. The latter meaning is very close to the literal translation here, as もの 'thing', がある 'there is' implies that the speaker strongly senses the presence of (A) within (B), even if they themselves cannot figure out why they feel that way. ものがある is primarily seen following verbs in either their dictionary or negated forms, い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives followed by な. As ものがある emphasizes the existence of (A) within (B), it is very common for the emphasized には to also be used in place of に when highlighting the topic. Caution Although 'I feel strongly that (A)' is a common interpretation of ものがある , it is important to remember that the actual thing that is generating that feeling within the speaker may either be very strong, or very weak. In other words, ものがある may be used even when something isn't obvious about (A), so long as the speaker themselves feel strongly about it. Fun-fact 目 を 見張 るものがある is a set phrase that is a combination of 目 を 見張 る 'to be astonished', and ものがある . In most cases, this expression just means that (B) is extremely surprising or impressive.",N2
ものだから,ものだから,,"Because, The reason is","ものだから is a strong phrase that is used when explaining something or giving an excuse for one's reasoning. This grammar structure can simply be thought of as an extension of から 'because', with the noun もの 'thing' having its usual role of emphasizing what is said before it. Common translations include 'because (A)', and 'the reason is (A)'. ものだから may appear directly after verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns that are followed with な. Occasionally, ものだから will be abbreviated to もので , or もんで , without any change in the overall meaning. The change of だ to its conjunctive form で indicates that there is something coming after, despite the fact that what comes after may sometimes be omitted if it is obvious. Fun-fact Although it is not a rule, ものだから will primarily be used when explaining one's actions, as a way of emphasizing that the situation of (A) specifically led to the speaker doing (B).",N2
ものだ,ものだ,,"Supposed to, Should, That's the way it is","もの (or 物 in its kanji form) is classified as a 形式名詞 (dummy noun) in Japanese. This just means a noun that is used in a similar way to 'thing' in English. もの regularly refers to things that do not have their own name, or are difficult to name due to their complexity. When もの is combined with the auxiliary verb だ , it implies that the previously mentioned (A) is something that 'is what it is'. This is often used in relation to customs, conventions, common sense, or to highlight results that would naturally be expected in any given situation. To use ものだ, attach it to the end of the attributive form of any word/word that ends a phrase that you would like to highlight as being an obvious piece of information. ものだ as 'supposed to', or 'the way it is' can also be used to negate a phrase, and say that it is 'something that isn't expected', or 'shouldn't be the case'. To do this, だ will be replaced with ではない, or じゃない. Caution もの may sometimes be abbreviated as もん. This is far more common in spoken language, and can make the statement sound a bit more casual overall.",N3
ものですから,ものですから・もので,,"Because, My excuse is, My explanation is","ものですから is a strong, slightly emphasized version of ものだから , a phrase that is used when explaining something or giving an excuse for one's reasoning. This grammar structure can simply be thought of as an extension of から 'because', with the noun もの 'thing' having its usual role of emphasizing what is said before it. Common translations include 'because (A)', and 'the reason is (A)'. ものですから may appear directly after verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns that are followed with な. Occasionally, ものですから will be abbreviated to もので , or もんで , without any change in the overall meaning. The change of だ to its conjunctive form で indicates that there is something coming after, despite the fact that what comes after may sometimes be omitted if it is obvious. Despite the slight difference in emphasis, ものだから and ものですから can be thought of as a single interchangable grammar structure in most situations. Fun-fact Although it is not a rule, ものですから will primarily be used when explaining one's actions, as a way of emphasizing that the situation of (A) specifically led to the speaker doing (B).",N2
ものとして,ものとして,,"Assuming, Supposing, (Interpret) as, On the assumption, Regarding, Considering","Like many grammar expressions that use もの, this noun will imply that the word or phrase that comes before it is a strong determination. Due to this, when として ‘as (A)’, or ‘in the capacity of (A)’ is added, it presents a situation in which the speaker is determining that (A) is true for the sake of discussion. In English, this may be interpreted as ‘supposing that (A)’, or ‘on the assumption that (A)’. ものとして will primarily be seen after verbs, and nouns followed by な. However, it may also occasionally appear after い-Adjectives. Caution Unlike として by itself, which indicates that something is being viewed as (A) because it is in fact (A), ものとして makes use of もの to take away a certain degree of definiteness about the identity of (A). Basically, this means that もの is being marked as the ‘thing’ that is true by として, while the word that もの follows may or may not be true, but is being assumed as true by the speaker. Let’s see how として and ものとして compare.",N1
ものとする,ものとする,,"Shall, To assume, To suppose, To consider","Like many grammar expressions that use もの, this noun will imply that the word or phrase that comes before it is a strong determination. Due to this, when とする ‘as (A)’, or ‘in the capacity of (A)’ is added, it presents a situation in which the speaker is determining that (A) is true for the sake of discussion. In English, this may be interpreted as ‘supposing that (A)’, or ‘on the assumption that (A)’. ものとする , like ものとして, will primarily be seen after verbs. However, unlike ものとして, ものとする will almost always appear at the end of a sentence, and highlights things that are being taken as facts in legalese, and other forms of contractual writing.",N1
ものと思う,ものと思う,,"Think that, Believe that, Expect that, Have confidence that, Absolutely","物 と 思 う is made up of the noun 物 'thing', the case marking particle と, and the う-Verb 思 う 'to think'. Regular translations include 'to believe that (A)', or 'to have confidence that (A)'. In a broader sense, this grammar pattern is just making use of one of the meanings of 物 as being something abstract that the speaker can reliably determine has all of the qualities of something concrete. As もの is a noun, this pattern may follow any word in its attributive form . When 思 う appears in the past tense, the most common translation is 'as I had believed was true of (A)', or 'I was under the impression that (A)'. Although this grammar construction is slightly formal, it may occasionally be heard in daily speech.",N1
ものと思っていた,ものと思っていた,,"Was under the impression that, (Always) the thought used to think","物 と 思 う is made up of the noun 物 'thing', the case marking particle と, and the う-Verb 思 う 'to think'. Regular translations include 'to believe that (A)', or 'to have confidence that (A)'. In a broader sense, this grammar pattern is just making use of one of the meanings of 物 as being something abstract that the speaker can reliably determine has all of the qualities of something concrete. When 思 う appears in the past tense as ものと 思 っていた , the most common translation is 'as I had believed was true of (A)', or 'I was under the impression that (A)'. As もの is a noun, this pattern may follow any word in its attributive form . As ものと 思 っていた highlights an impression of something that was true, contradictory statements will often appear in part (B) of the sentence following structures like が or けど.",N1
ものなら,ものなら①,,"If, If one could, If something would be possible","Often seen after the potential form of verbs is the conjunction particle ものなら . This grammar pattern expresses that while (A) is not thought to be possible, if it were possible, (B). Common translations include 'if (A), (B)', if one could (A), (B)', and 'if (A) were possible, (B)'. As ものなら is just a combination of もの and the hypothetical form of だ (なら), ものなら simply states that if (A) were a 'thing', then (B). Due to ものなら regularly expressing a desired outcome in the (B) part of sentences, this grammar structure will usually be accompanied by てみる or てみたい. Additionally, もし may also appear at the beginning of the sentence to further increase the nuance of 'if'. てみる is often used for criticism, suggesting that if someone thinks that (A) were possible, then perhaps they should try it. てみたい on the other hand is more commonly seen when (A) is wished for, and the speaker would like to do it if possible. While not a strict rule, the verb in both the (A) and (B) parts of ものなら sentences is frequently the same. Especially when expressing a desire to do (A).",N2
ものなら,ものなら②,,"If you were to do, If you try to, If … happens, Should there be","ものなら is a combination of the noun もの ‘thing’, and the hypothetical form of the auxiliary verb だ, なら ‘if’. Common translations include ‘If you were to (A), (B)’, of ‘if (A) happens, (B)’. In this particular use of ものなら , (A) will be a verb in its volitional form, and (B) will be some sort of negative result that would come about from that. Let’s have a look at a few examples. Keeping in mind that the volitional form can mean to approach an action with reckless abandon, it can be thought of as being similar to the English ‘to go and do (A)’, where the ‘to go and’ just indicates proceeding ahead without carefully considering the outcome. Fun Fact なら is often translated as ‘if’ in many textbooks and online resources, but knowing that it is just a conjugation of だ ‘is’, the more literal translation is ‘were’. This ‘were’ behaves exactly the same way in English in hypothetical situations, so may potentially be better if you would like to avoid confusion between other ‘if’ grammar patterns like ば, と, and たら. An example of this can be seen in sentences like ‘were it to rain tomorrow, then I would need an umbrella’. Because of this, it is recommended to memorize なら purely as ‘were’, rather than the ‘if’ interpretation that is usually attached to it.",N1
ものの,ものの,,"Although, But, Even Though","ものの is a formal conjunction-particle used to illustrate that while (A) is a fact, the result or condition of (B) cannot be attributed to (A), could not be predicted through (A), or is in direct contrast to (A). ものの may appear directly after verb, い-Adjectives, nouns followed by である, or な-Adjectives followed by な. Caution ものの may only be used when the subject or topic of the sentence is the same in both the statements preceding and following it.",N2
ものを,ものを,,"But, Although, If only, I wish I had","ものを is a grammar point that functions in a similar way to のに in that it will express that (A) is something that was desired, despite (B) being the actual result. However, it is primarily used when the speaker is trying to convey their displeasure at the result of (B), due to (A) being something that by all means should have happened. ものを will be translated as 'if only (A)', or '(A), but (B)'. Despite being a construction of もの and the adverbial particle を, ものを is often considered as a standalone conjunction particle . It can be seen following verbs or い-Adjectives in their standard form , or な-Adjectives followed by な. As can be seen in the above examples, ものを is almost always preceded by hypothetical structures such as ば at some point leading up to its use. Caution ものを will often be seen at the end of sentences, with what would have come after it being left unspoken. In these cases, the important information is still there, as the (A) part of the sentence will always highlight what the ideal result was. Because of this, it can be safely assumed that the speaker is just frustrated that (A) didn't happen. Fun Fact The adverbial particle を is often used this way in Japanese, where no specific action is linked to it. In these situations it usually just indicates an ideal or goal to which the method of achieving it (the verb that would usually be attached to を) is omitted. ものを can be thought of as an extension of this in literally meaning 'to that which was (A)', with 'I wish it had happened' being unsaid.",N1
もの,もの・もん,,"Because, Cause","もの , an extremely common noun in Japanese that means 'thing', can also be used as a sentence ending particle . In these cases, it adds a small amount of emotion to a statement, and presents it as a reason. Due to this, もの is usually translated as 'because', or 'cause'. Literally, it just means 'it's an (A) thing!'. もの is quite casual, so should be avoided in formal situations. To use もの as 'because', attach it to the end of the plain form of any word. To emphasize もの even further, the explanatory んだ (after a verb or い-Adjective ), or なんだ (after a な-Adjective or noun) will often be used. Caution もの can be shortened to もん in its use as a sentence ending particle. However, this makes the statement sound far more 'cute' or 'childish'. Due to this, it should be avoided in standard conversation. Fun Fact Although it is not used regularly in standard Japanese, ん です もの is a slightly more polite version of んだもの that appears frequently in anime, manga, and novels.",N3
もん,もの・もん,,"Because, Cause","もの , an extremely common noun in Japanese that means 'thing', can also be used as a sentence ending particle . In these cases, it adds a small amount of emotion to a statement, and presents it as a reason. Due to this, もの is usually translated as 'because', or 'cause'.

貰う,もらう,v-unspec,"To receive, To get, To obtain","もらう is the 3rd verb that is regularly taught together with くれる , and あげる . It is used to highlight that (A) is 'received' by someone. However, unlike くれる and あげる (which are used to highlight that something is 'given'), もらう requires the に particle (or から ) to mark the giver, not the recipient. が or は may be used to mark the recipient, as they are the one performing the action of receiving. を will mark the object that is being given. In the second sentence we can see that the recipient has been omitted, while in the third example, the giver was omitted. This is a regular occurrence when using もらう , as the receiver is usually obvious, or the 'giver' may not be important to the overall meaning of the sentence. In this example, the thing that was given is the focus, while the speaker does not consider the 'giver' something that needs to be mentioned. Sometimes, for very simple sentences with clear context, neither the 'giver', nor the 'receiver' needs to be mentioned.",N5
も又,も又,,"Too, Also (with more emphasis than も alone), Again","When used adverbially, the grouping of も and 又 'once again', or 'also' will indicate that 'in addition to (A), (B)', or 'also with (A), (B)'. This structure appears after nouns, or noun-like phrases and simply emphasizes that something important needs to be considered about (A). The noun or noun-phrase that もまた is connected to will be interpreted to be the primary point of a statement, regardless of any contrasting opinion that is given within a sentence. Additionally, もまた will primarily appear in hiragana, and may be thought of simply as a stronger version of も.",N2
も～ば～も……,も～ば～も,,"…And…, Both ... and ..., ... And ... as well","も～ば～も is a construction in Japanese which presents aspects of something to which both (A) and (B) are true. も will be connected to a noun, before the hypothetical marking particle ば will appear following a verb, い-Adjective, な-Adjective, or noun. In the case of nouns and な-Adjectives, なら or ならば will be used. In this way, も～ば～も just highlights that 'If (A) is true, then so is (B)'. This usually just emphasizes that (A) and (B) are things that go together hand-in-hand, with one trait or characteristic always existing if the other does. Standard translations include 'both (A) and (B) are (C)', or 'the trait of (C), is in (A) and (B) as well'. Caution With も～ば～も , both traits must be things that share some sort of mutual connection. This means that both (A) and (B) will either be positive, neutral, or negative, but never a mixture of any one.",N2
も,も,prt,"Also, Too, As well, Even, Either, Neither","も can mean 'too/also', or 'even', or 'neither/either', depending on if the sentence is affirmative or negative. Multiple meanings like this are quite common for Japanese particles, as there is no need to use different words simply to agree with other statements in the sentence (unlike English). As you can see here, English requires 'either/neither (when negative)', or 'too/also', but Japanese only requires も . You can think of it as simply meaning 'Whatever is true for (A), is also true for (B)'. も is part of many other compound grammar structures in which it keeps its original meaning, but shifts the nuance a little bit. Some of these include でも , にも～ない , とも . As we can see, it is frequently paired with other particles! Here, も can be seen pairing with で . This suggests that 'With (A), (B) also'. This is regularly translated simply as 'but' in English, despite the nuance being closer to 'and also'.",N5
やがて,やがて,,"Before long, All too soon, In the end, Eventually","軈 て , meaning 'all too soon' is an adverb that appears at the beginning of sentences in order to indicate that some particular state that does not currently exist, will end up happening within an unspecified (usually short) amount of time. This can be translated as 'before long (A)', 'in the end (A)', or 'eventually (A)'. In the vast majority of cases, やがて will appear in hiragana. Caution In cases where やがて is used with a specified amount of time, it may be interpreted as 'nearly'. Fun-fact Originally, やがて was just used as a way to express the existence of something which has not currently taken place. Due to this, it had many more meanings in the past. This included things such as 'namely', 'immediately', 'in a moment', and others. All of these meanings simply hinted at the fact that the expression following やがて was already expected or known.",N2
～易い,やすい,,"Easy to, Likely to","易 い is an い-Adjective that is regularly seen attached to the ます stem of verbs (the form of a verb that can be used as a noun). When attached in this way, it carries the meaning of 'easy to (A)', where (A) is the verb that comes before やすい . Sometimes, やすい has a translation that is a bit closer to 'prone to (A)', or 'likely to (A)' in English. This nuance is regularly seen when the verb is related to emotions. Caution There is another adjective 安 い that has the meaning of 'cheap'. This kanji should never be used with verbs to mean 'easy'. Most of the time, やすい itself will be written in hiragana, and usage of 易 い is quite limited. Fun Fact Although 易 い is an い-Adjective , it is almost never used by itself (when not attached to verbs). In such cases, it is much more natural to use the な-Adjective 簡単 .",N4
やら〜やら,やら～やら,,"Whether or, Things like, And … so on","やら is an adverbial particle in Japanese which expresses lack of determination or limitation in regard to (A). Due to this, it is very similar to other structures like など, and will often translate as '(A) and so on', or '(A) and the like'. やら may appear following verbs in their dictionary form, nouns, い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives. When repeated as (A) やら (B) やら , both (A) and (B) will often be the same type of word, although this is not a limitation when the speaker is expressing various feelings in relation to something. Compared to とか , やら puts more emphasis on the scope of things within the category of (A) and (B), thus making it sound like (A) and (B) are only a small fraction of many different things within a complex pool of various emotions, actions, etc. Caution When appearing as のやら～のやら , this emphasizes that the speaker does not actually know which one out of (A) and (B) is the correct option, and is just presenting both as potential possibilities. Due to this, (A) and (B) will often be antonyms or opposites of some sort in these types of sentences, but not always.",N2
や,や,prt,"Things like, And the like","や is a particle that has several different roles in Japanese, with the most common being as an adverbial particle . や is used similarly to と as 'and', but rather than listing specific things in a group, it lists 'things like (A)'. や is always used to group nouns, and simply comes directly after them. To compare how と and や are different, imagine that there is a bowl of fruit. In this bowl there are apples, oranges, and peaches. If と is used to list the apples and oranges, it would give the listener the impression that there are no peaches. This is called an 'exhaustive' list, meaning that all possibilities should be listed. However, if や is used, the listener would know that there are other things in the bowl apart from the apples and oranges. In this way, や is a better choice when you want to say 'and', but don't want to limit the group that you are listing. Caution や cannot be used after verb phrases. This is done with たり , or とか .",N5
故に,ゆえに,,"Because, The reason is, Due to, Therefore, So","When the noun 故 'consequence' is paired with the case marking particle に, it will be used in formal situations to highlight reasons. This may be interpreted as 'because of (A)', 'due to (A)', or 'the reason is (A)'. However, 'consequently to (A)', or 'as a consequence of (A)' are also completely acceptable translations that may help to differentiate ゆえに from less formal structures. As ゆえ itself is a noun, regular grammar rules such as being preceded by の will need to be followed if directly following another noun. In other cases, ゆえに will simply attach to the standard form of words. ゆえに may also appear at the beginning of new sentences. When this happens, it expresses 'as a result of (A)', where (A) is the entire previous sentence. The に will need to be replaced with の when ゆえ is being connected to another noun and therefore modifying it. Caution Just like 'as a consequence of' in English, ゆえに tends to be used far more frequently in regard to negative reasons than positive ones.",N1
様がない',ようがない・ようもない,,"There's no way to, It's impossible to","様 がない or 様 もない is an expression used to highlight that there is no 'method' or 'manner' in which to do (A). It can be interpreted as 'there is no way to (A)', or 'it's impossible to (A)'. This phrase will appear attached to the conjunctive form of verbs. 様 がない often focuses on that the action of (A) is not possible, despite that the speaker may actually want to do it. Caution Because 様 will often appear in hiragana, it is important not to get it mixed up with よう, the auxiliary verb used to create the volitional form of verbs such as する.",N2
様だ,ようだ,,"It seems that, It appears that, It looks like","In a similar way to みたい , ようだ is used when making observations about something in Japanese. This auxiliary verb is used to express three primary things. たとえ - Using (A) as an example to highlight the way that (B) looks/is acting. 推定 - Using (A) as a reason for an assumption made about (B). 例示 - Presenting (A) as an example of what (B) is. ようだ is usually based on direct information/experience, and shows that the speaker has high confidence in what they are saying. It may also frequently appear in its kanji form, 様 だ. ようだ can be used with any verb, い-Adjective , な-Adjective , or noun. However, it requires な before it when used with な-Adjectives , or の when used with nouns. Although ようだ and そうだ are often used in similar situations, そうだ shows that the speaker has a lot less confidence in their statement than ようだ . Because of this, ようだ is a much better choice when stating things that are obvious/observable by anyone. Caution ようだ is considerably more formal than みたい , and is therefore less common in casual conversation.",N4
う,〜ようではないか,,"Let's do something, Why don't we","ようではないか is a construction that will primarily be used for making suggestions for mutual activities. This is a combination of either of the auxiliary verbs う or よう, ではない, and the sentence-ending particle, か. う and よう primarily express will or intent like 'shall' in English. Due to the negation following them, the literal translation will be similar to 'shall we not do (A)?'. For ease of translation, this structure can be remembered as simply 'let's do (A)', or 'why don't we do (A)'. As with all structures that use う or よう, ようではないか will be attached to the end of a verb indicating the action which is being suggested. Alternatively, the abbreviated form of じゃない may be used in place of ではない. Despite this, ようではないか is primarily a formal grammar structure, so will most often use the unabbreviated version, or even more polite ようではありませんか construction. Fun-fact Occasionally, this grammar structure may be seen preceded by もらう. In these cases, it is usually challenging the listener to do something. This can be interpreted as 'why don't I have you do (A) then'.",N2
よう,〜ようではないか,,"Let's do something, Why don't we","ようではないか is a construction that will primarily be used for making suggestions for mutual activities. This is a combination of either of the auxiliary verbs う or よう, ではない, and the sentence-ending particle, か. う and よう primarily express will or intent like 'shall' in English.

This can be interpreted as 'why don't I have you do (A) then'.",N2
様では,ようでは・ようじゃ,,"If, If it is true that","ようでは is a combination of the auxiliary verb 様 'manner', or 'seeming', and では, a conjunction that is frequently used as an abbreviation of それなら in expressing 'if'. Due to this, ようでは itself often has the meaning of 'if', with extra focus on the fact that (A) is something unconfirmed, or only being guessed at. This may be translated as 'if it is the case that (A)', or 'if that which seems to be (A) is true'. In most cases, ようでは will be used to make an evaluation that if (A) is true, then some particular negative result will arise from it. ようでは will primarily appear after verbs in any of their standard forms. ようでは puts extra focus on the appearance or condition of (A), based on what is observable by the speaker. In this way, it is often the speaker's subjective (negative) opinion about what they perceive to be true.",N2
う,〜ようと思う・〜おうと思う,,"I think I will, I think I shall, Going to, Gonna (Volitional + と思う)","The combination of a verb with the auxiliary verb う , or よう , followed by the う-Verb 思 う gives us the common expression ようと 思 う . This expression is often translated as 'I think I will (A)', or 'I shall (A)'. It is also close to the casual expression 'I'm gonna (A)'. Remembering that う and よう can have one of three possible meanings in Japanese (as discussed in the よう grammar point), ようと 思 う is usually only used to express one of those three. That 'one' is as follows: 意志 - Expresses intentions (has a similar meaning to ～するつもりだ ）. This expression is also often used with 思 っている . In these cases, it highlights that the intention of the speaker is something that they regularly think, or have been thinking about for some time. 思 っている may also be used when describing the intentions of another person, as discussed in our lesson about と 思 う . Caution Let's be careful to remember the difference between the auxiliary verbs よう , and ようだ . They are different constructions that have different meanings, and behave in unique ways grammatically.",N4
よう,〜ようと思う・〜おうと思う,,"I think I will, I think I shall, Going to, Gonna (Volitional + と思う)","The combination of a verb with the auxiliary verb う , or よう , followed by the う-Verb 思 う gives us the common expression ようと 思 う .

様な気がする,ような気がする,,Have a feeling that,"ような 気 がする is a phrase that takes the base meaning of 気 がする 'to have a feeling that (A)', or 'to give off a vibe that (A)', and adds an extra layer of uncertainty through use of the auxiliary verb よう. This can be understood as meaning 'to have a funny feeling that (A)', or 'to kinda have a feeling that (A)'. As always, よう must be attached to the attributive form of any word that comes before it. Caution 気 がする is quite a bit stronger than ような 気 がする , so the latter will often be used when the speaker is not 100% sure about something, and does not want to sound rude.",N3
様に言う,ようにいう,,"To tell, request, or order to do (in such a way)","ようにいう is an expression which combines the auxiliary verb ようだ , with the う-Verb 言 う. This indicates that something is being said in a way that instigates (A). As ようだ is being linked to the verb 言 う, it will take on its adverbial form, ように . As ようにいう means 'to be said in the way of (A) being done', it is regularly translated as 'to tell', 'to request', or 'to order'. In the case of requesting, 頼 む may substitute for 言 う. For ordering, 命 じる may substitute for it instead. 言 う itself is the most versatile of these three verbs, as it may imply 'to order', or 'to request'. This will depend on the tone of the speaker/overall context of the request/order.",N4
様に祈る,ようにいのる,,"Pray that/for, Hope that/for, Keep fingers crossed that","As we have seen several times now, the auxiliary verb ようだ is frequently used with verbs, to express that the 'completion' of an action is the specific goal/wish of the speaker. It does this implicitly through the meaning of the kanji 様 'manner of doing'. ようにいのる (or 祈 る in its kanji form) is no different, and will imply that the speaker is praying for (A) to be done/completed. This comes from the meaning of the う-Verb 祈 る itself, which can be translated as 'to pray', or 'to beg'. Despite being able to be used when actually praying, this grammar point is used most often to express a 'hope'. In a similar way to other ように structures, ないように may also be used with 祈 る, to show that someone is praying for something 'not' to happen. Caution However, 'unlike' other ように structures, ように 祈 る will sometimes be shortened to ように by itself. This is especially true after ます. This is the only ように structure that will have the verb that comes after it omitted. Therefore, ように (by itself) will always mean 'to hope for', and should not be confused with ようにする , ようになる , ようにいう , and other similar grammar points. Fun Fact といい is also used to express 'to hope for (A)', or 'to wish for (A)'. However, unlike ように 祈 る , the person that the speaker is praying for with といい will mainly be determined by the use of ね (praying for someone else), or な (praying for themselves).",N4
様にする,ようにする,,"To try to, To make sure to, To endeavor to","(A) ようにする is an expression in Japanese which combines the auxiliary verb ようだ , with する (indicating that you will 'try' to do something). As ようだ is being linked to the verb する , it will take on its adverbial form, ように . This structure emphasizes that the (A) action (always a verb) is something that the speaker is going out of their way to do, and implies effort. Naturally, this structure may also be used with a negative verb, to imply that (A) being done is something that is actively being avoided. This translates as 'to make sure not to do (A)'. Fun Fact Because ようだ comes from the kanji 様 'manner', it carries the nuance that the 'way' that someone is doing (A) is specifically in a way that has success as the goal. Literally it translates quite closely to 'to do (A) in the manner of getting it done', and therefore just strengthens the (A) action, by using 'to do' twice.",N4
様になる,ようになる,,"To reach the point that, To come to be that, To turn into","When combined with the particle に , and the う-Verb なる, よう expresses that a particular action has reached the point of being completed/able to be completed. Because of this, ようになる is regularly translated as 'to reach the point that (A)', or 'to turn into (A)'. To use ようになる , it will need to be added to the plain- potential , non-past form of a verb. Caution When using this grammar construction, we will need to remember that する does not have a potential form. Therefore, できる will be used with words that usually act as する verbs. However, ようになる is not limited to being used in affirmative sentences, and may also be used after a verb with ない. This shows that something has reached the point of 'not' being able to be completed.",N4
様によっては,ようによっては,,"Depending on the way, Depending on how","ようによっては is used in Japanese to indicate that the way in which something is done will determine the result. This structure is a combination of the noun 様 ‘manner’, or ‘way’, the case-marking particle に, the て-form of the う-Verb, よる ‘to depend on (A)’, or ‘to be due to (A)’, and the adverbial particle は. The standard translation is ‘depending on the way that (A), (B)’. ようによっては will often highlight results that vary greatly from person to person, or from one method to the other. This grammar pattern will appear after the conjunctive form of verbs. Caution This phrase may be simply considered to be a more advanced version of the suffix 方 , which also highlights a ‘way’. In fact, the two suffixes are completely interchangeable, with 様 being the more formal of the two.",N1
様に～て欲しい,ように～てほしい,,"Want ~ to ~ like ~, Want ~ to be able to ~, Want ~ to ~ in the way of ~","(A) ように～てほしい is an expression in Japanese which combines the auxiliary verb , ようだ , with the てほしい structure (indicating that you/someone else wants someone to do something). As ようだ is being linked to a verb which comes later in the sentence, it will take on the adverbial form ように . This expression is used to highlight that you (or someone else) want someone to do something 'in the way of (A)'. Note that when ように follows a noun, の will be required. Either に or が may mark the thing that the speaker 'wants' to do. It is more common for に to be used to mark people, while が will often mark events/objects. Fun Fact Sometimes が and に will be switched, if either of those particles have already been used somewhere else in a sentence. This is mainly to avoid sounding repetitive, or confusion about what the subject of the sentence is.",N4
様+,ように・ような,,"As・like, Just like","We have seen many cases now where the auxiliary verb ようだ may be modified slightly to show that something is being done 'in a way' that will bring about a specific outcome. In this lesson, we will look at how ような (when used with nouns), or ように (when used with verbs) may be used with almost any noun/verb, to show that they are being done/existing in a particular manner. Sometimes, this structure is used purely to express the speaker's uncertainty about whether (B) really is being done/existing in the way of (A). In these cases, ように (or ような ) will be translated as 'as if', or 'as though'.",N4
様に,ように,,"So that, In order to, In such a way that","When partnered with verbs in the potential form, or in the negative form, the auxiliary verb ようだ (in its adverbial form ように ) implies that the speaker has a lack of direct control over an outcome, and therefore is 'trying to do (B) in the manner of (A)', but cannot guarantee the result. This grammar point is usually translated as 'to do (A) in such a way that will enable (B)', or 'in order to allow (B)'. To use ように in this way, simply add it to the non-past form of any verb in its negative, potential , or standard conjugation. As mentioned in our lesson about potential verbs, する does not actually have a potential form, and therefore できる will be used instead.",N4
う,Verb[よう],,"Let's, I shall (Casual volitional)","よう (and う ) are grammar constructions that function in a similar way to ましょう , or to be more precise, ましょう is the polite (conjugated) form of these auxiliary verbs . They are used as a casual way of expressing 'let's' when making suggestions, or 'I shall' when making statements. よう is only one of the potential forms of this grammar point, and can actually be divided into two separate auxiliary verbs , う (used with う-Verbs ), and よう (used with る-Verbs , する , and くる ). When attaching う to う-Verbs , simply replace the last kana with the equivalent お sound kana from within the same column (く becomes こ, う becomes お, す becomes そ, etc.), before adding う . For る-Verbs , replace る with よう . As with many other verb conjugations, する and くる behave in a slightly different way to regular う-Verbs and る-Verbs . する will become し よう , while くる will become こ よう . The type of statements that う , and よう can be used for in Japanese are usually divided into three categories. 推量 - Expresses guesses (has a similar meaning to だろう , which itself is the よう form of だ ) 意志 - Expresses intentions (has a similar meaning to ～するつもりだ ) 勧誘 - Expresses invitations or encouragement (has a similar meaning to 誘 う 'to invite') Caution Although よう is used with る-Verbs , する , and くる , it should not be confused with ようだ , another auxiliary verb that is used when describing likeness (in a similar way to そうだ ).",N4
よう,Verb[よう],,"Let's, I shall (Casual volitional)","よう (and う ) are grammar constructions that function in a similar way to ましょう , or to be more precise, ましょう is the polite (conjugated) form of these auxiliary verbs . They are used as a casual way of expressing 'let's' when making suggestions, or 'I shall' when making statements. よう is only one of the potential forms of this grammar point, and can actually be divided into two separate auxiliary verbs , う (used with う-Verbs ), and よう (used with る-Verbs , する , and くる ).

予定だ,よていだ,,"Plan to, Intend to","予定 だ is an expression that functions very similarly to つもりだ 'to intend to do'. The primary difference being that 予定 is a 'plan', rather than an 'intention'. Due to this, 予定 is used far more frequently for things that you have formal plans to do (like meeting a friend for lunch). To use 予定 , just attach it to the non-past form of a verb, or to a noun (after inserting の ). Caution If だ or です is not added after 予定 , it will imply that 予定 is simply modifying the verb/noun that comes before it, rather than being a standalone 'plan'. This is similar to the difference between saying something like 'I have plans to eat with a friend' (natural), vs 'I have an eating with a friend plan' (unnatural).",N4
より仕方がない,よりしかたがない,,"There is no choice but, Can't be helped, Inevitable","Often seen as a set phrase, よりしかたがない consists of より, the noun 仕方 'way' or 'method', が and ない. When preceded by a verb in its dictionary form, it just conveys that 'there is no choice but (A)', or that '(A) cannot be helped'. Occasionally the が will be dropped, between 仕方 and ない. Keeping almost exactly the same style of translation is a similar pattern, より 他 にない . The only actual difference is that this structure expresses that there is no 'other' alternative, rather than being no 'method'. The noun 他 'other' and に will simply replace 仕方 'method' and が. As with 仕方 が, the に will often be dropped in 他 に. Both よりしかたがない and よりほかにない have a tendency to express some particular evaluation of (A) that cannot be helped or denied, or simply that 'given the situation, (A) cannot be avoided'.",N2
より他ない,よりほかない,,"To have no choice but, No other way than, Have to","Used in a similar way to しかない, より 他 ない is a structure that emphasizes that only (A) is possible, when attached to the end of verbs. This grammar pattern is a combination of the case marking particle より 'than', or 'from', the noun 他 'other', and the い-Adjective, ない. From this it can be translated directly as 'there is nothing other than (A)'. However, the emphasis is usually on the impossibility of doing anything other than (A), rather than the existence of nothing else. Common interpretations include 'to have no choice but to (A)', 'there is no other way than (A)', or simply 'have to (A)'. Occasionally,  the particles に, は, or a combination of both as には may come between 他 and ない. While this does not change the meaning, it does further emphasize the point that there is no choice but (A).",N2
より～の方が,より～のほうが,exp,To be more ~ than ~,"より～のほうが can be thought of as similar to the grammar points たほうがいい , and ないほうがいい , in that it expresses that one thing is the 'better (A)', or 'more (A)'. However, unlike ほうがいい based expressions, any pair of adjectives, verbs, or nouns may be compared in this construction, so long as のほうが is followed by an adjective. より translates roughly to 'than', or 'rather than' in this phrase. From the examples listed here, we can see that より will always appear after the word that has the lower extent of (A), when used together with のほうが . Caution When より is used by itself, or when it is not linked directly to the previous word, it can seem like it has the opposite meaning. However, in these cases, のほうが just remains unsaid. In this example, because the より is after が , not before これ , it is easy to assume that これ is the thing that is lower. However, this が behaves in the same way as のほうが , meaning that これ itself is the more expensive thing, with より just being used like 'relatively' (compared to many other things). Caution Although の 方 が is the most common construction, the particle を may sometimes replace が. This is especially true when used with markers of desire such as たい and ほしい. The primary difference between these two is that が emphasizes what a person wants or wants to do (the whole statement), while を emphasizes the item or action itself (regardless of the rest of the statement). With たい, both を and が will sound completely natural. However, with ほしい, が will be more natural, while を is accepted. This use of ほしい only applies to wanting items, as opposed to たい, which indicates the desire to 'do' something.",N5
より,より,,"More than, Over","In N5, we learned about the use of より that is seen when making comparisons in より～のほうが . However, in this lesson, we will take a look at how this case marking particle can be used by itself. When used alone, this particle expresses that (A) (a noun or verb) is being compared to (B) (a noun or verb that is regularly paired with an adjective). The word that より is directly attached to will always be 'less than' the comparison being made. However, the overall expression is used to describe that (B) is 'more' (something) than (A). Caution In many textbooks, より is taught as meaning 'more', but the word that より is attached to will actually be the thing that is 'less' (something). The word/quote that has が attached to it will be the thing that is 'more' (adjective). This is particularly confusing when より is not directly attached to a word, something which is common in casual spoken language. In this sentence, because the が is attached to これ , これ is the thing that is 'more expensive'. As より is not actually directly connected to any other word, it therefore means that これ is expensive, compared to 'other things'. When you see より like this, just pretend that it says 'other things' before it.",N4
よ,よ,prt,Emphasis (Sentence ending particle),"よ is classified as a sentence ending particle in Japanese. In most cases, it is used to convey new information to the listener, or just to add a bit of emphasis. Like most sentence ending particles, it is simply added to the end of almost any sentence. Despite the standard use of よ being to convey new information, it is also very regularly paired with ね , to convey the meaning of 'right?!'. This more literally means something closer to 'I think (A), and I bet you think (A) too!'. Caution Did you notice that there is a だ after the noun, but not the い-Adjective ? This is not a unique rule for よ , but just one of the regular conjugation rules introduced in the lessons for い-Adjectives and な-Adjectives . It is also acceptable to use です よ after either type of adjective (or noun).",N5
らしい,らしい,,"Seems like, Apparently, I heard","The auxiliary verb らしい is very similar to the auxiliary verbs そうだ and ようだ , in that it expresses something that the speaker 'thinks' is true. This use is known as 推定 (presumption) in Japanese. However, despite being a presumption/assumption, らしい usually sounds relatively confident. らしい is regularly translated as 'it seems like (A)', or 'I heard that (A)'. To use らしい , attach it to end of any (non-polite) verb, adjective, or noun. In these examples, らしい indicates that the speaker has some reason to believe that (A) is true. This could be that they heard, saw, or read something, but are still not 100% sure whether their understanding is correct or not. In this way, it sounds very similar to 'it appears as though (A)' in English. Caution There are 2 main forms of らしい in Japanese. The auxiliary verb usage mentioned above, and the 形容詞 の 一部 (auxiliary adjective), a type of adjective that must be attached to another word for it to have any meaning usage. らしい has the meaning of something that is 'typical of (A)', when used as an auxiliary adjective. This い-Adjective use of らしい will be covered more in our second らしい lesson.",N4
らしい,らしい,,"typical of, -ish・like, appropriate for, becoming of, befitting","In our first らしい lesson, we discussed the auxiliary verb use of らしい . In this lesson we will focus on the 形容詞 の 一部 (auxiliary adjective) usage. An auxiliary adjective is a type of adjective that must be attached to another word for it to have any meaning. To use らしい in this way, it must be attached to the end of a noun, and will imply that something is 'typical of (A)', where (A) is the noun that comes before it. As this らしい behaves like an い-Adjective , it may also be conjugated to らしく , before a (B) phrase will explain more about 'what' is/was typical of (A). The primary use of this らしい is to express that (A) has some feature or trait that is expected of itself. It can be used for people, 'studying all night is so typical of Tanaka', or it can be used for things like seasons 'this heat is so typical of the Japanese Summer'. Other common translations are 'to be befitting of (A)', or 'to be appropriate for (A)'. However, it may also be used negatively, to show that something is (often surprisingly) 'uncharacteristic of (A)'. Fun Fact When the noun that appears in (A) and (B) are the same, it will imply that (A) is the 'prime example of (B)', or 'the most (A), (B)'.",N4
等,～ら,,"We, Them, They, These, Those","There are many prefixes and suffixes in Japanese that are used depending on what the speaker wants to highlight. ら is a suffix (component used after the main part of a word) that implies that there is 'more than one' of something. Due to this, ら is often called a 'pluralizing suffix'. ら comes from the same kanji as 等 , and the literal meaning is closer to '(A) etc'. This 'etc' is where the implication of 'more than one' originates. To use ら , attach it to the end of any pronoun. Caution Because ら has a literal meaning that is close to '(A) etc', or '(A) and so on', it may sometimes be considered a bit rude (due to being dismissive). Because of this, it is recommended to not use this suffix in relation to people, unless it is absolutely essential to indicate plural. In most cases, 達 will be a far better choice.",N4
～る所だ,るところだ,,"About to, On the verge of","The noun ところ (sometimes shortened to とこ ) is often used to describe the 'place' or 'situation' in which something happens. The primary determining factor for the nuance of ところ , is the tense of the verb it follows. When it is in the non-past form, ところ means 'about to (A)', or 'on the verge of (A)'. Caution When the kanji form of 所 is used, it is often referring to an actual physical location, rather than a situation/standpoint. However, this is something that native speakers will sometimes mistake. Therefore, seeing the kanji form, and the hiragana form, are both relatively common.",N4
る-,る-Verb,v-unspec,る - Verbs (Negative-past tense),"In order to form the negative past form of る-Verbs , you will need to remove the る, and then follow it with the auxiliary verb ない (or ます), conjugated into their past forms. This will either be なかった (casual), or ませんでした (polite). A semi-polite form may also be used. This is constructed by using なかった , and then simply adding です . This form is not grammatically correct, but is so common that most sources (and native speakers) would consider it correct.",N5
る-,る-Verb,v-unspec,る - Verbs (Past tense),"To make the past form of a る-Verb in Japanese, just like all other conjugations of る-Verbs , you will need to remove the る first. After this, all you need to do is add the auxiliary verb た (casual), or ました (polite). Fun Fact ました is actually just ます conjugated with た on the end of it, so it is two (2) auxiliary verbs , not just one. This means that only た gives the meaning of 'past' to a word, while ます keeps it's regular role of making the verb more polite. When た is added to verbs (or any other word), it can have one of three possible meanings. Past: 過去 - Happened at some point in the past. (Did/Was) Completion: 完了 - An action that has finished 'happening'. (Done) Continuation: 存続 - A new state of something that is continuing. (Has been done)",N5
る-,る-Verb,v-unspec,る + ます (Ichidan Verbs),"る-Verbs are verbs that have only one possible conjugation pattern. This pattern simply involves the replacement of る with another construction, depending on the tense of the verb ( past , negative , etc). This conjugation pattern that only includes る is where the Japanese name Ichidan ( 一段 ) 'one-level' comes from. In these examples, we can see that る is removed from the verb to create the polite ます form. The る form of the verb is often called 'plain form', 'casual form', or 'short form', depending on the source/book. All る-Verbs end in the kana る, there are no exceptions to this rule. Caution While all る-Verbs end in る, not all verbs that end in る are る-Verbs . These verbs can be identified by the る changing, rather than being removed when conjugated. As the る in 取 る becomes り in 取 ります, we can determine immediately that it is not a る-Verb , but actually a う-Verb .",N5
る-,る-Verb,v-unspec,Will/Does/Do (not),"The negative form of る-Verbs are conjugated based on the same set of rules used for other forms of る-Verb conjugation (removal of る, followed by the addition of something else). In the case of negation, the additional component will be ない (casual), or ません (polite). While the common translation of ない and ません is simply 'not', they actually have several possible nuances. These nuances are 'don't' (usually not), 'won't' (intentionally not), or 'can't' (unintentionally not). Both ない and ません are auxiliary verbs ( ません is a conjugation of ます), meaning that they have their own set of conjugation rules. Caution The ない attached to make the negative form of adjectives is a different word, and therefore follows different conjugation rules. When attached to adjectives ない itself is an い-Adjective , and not an auxiliary verb .",N5
訳がない,わけがない,,"There is no way, There is no reason, It is impossible, Cannot be","One of the strongest ways to use the noun わけ in Japanese, is in the expression わけがない . This is regularly translated as 'there is no way that (A)', or 'it is impossible that (A)'. However, as mentioned in other わけ lessons, わけ is used very similarly to 'so' in English, so may also be thought of as 'it is SO not (A)', with 'so' being used for emphasis. In this structure, わけ is combined with the case marking particle が, and the い-Adjective ない. わけがない may be used with verbs, or adjectives in their attributive form . Caution Compared to わけではない, わけがない is much stronger, and emphasizes the 'non-existence' of something. This can be thought of as similar to the difference between 'it is so that it isn't (A)' (for わけではない), and 'it is SO not (A)' (for わけがない ). 'It is so that it isn't (A)' highlights that (A) is a thing that exists, but not in the way of (A). On the other hand, 'it is SO not (A)' highlights that no part of (A) whatsoever can be considered to be correct/accurate.",N3
訳だ,わけだ,,"For that reason, No wonder, As you'd expect, Naturally, Thus, This is why","One of the most misunderstood words in Japanese is 訳 . Of the many ways it can be translated, the most common are 'reason', 'cause', 'meaning', or 'conclusion'. Despite this, it may be beneficial to consider it almost identical to an equally versatile English word 'so'. In all of its uses, わけ simply highlights the plain existence/determination of something in the same way that 'so' does in English. This can be seen in its most basic form in わけだ . A combination of わけ and the auxiliary verb だ . わけだ will be used at the end of sentences, and is sometimes preceded by という. This use is often translated as 'for the reason of (A)', 'no wonder its (A)', or 'its (A), as you'd expect'. Realistically though, it just means 'it is so that it's (A)', or 'so it's (A)'. Due to わけ being a noun, it will need to follow the attributive form of whatever word comes before it. As we can see 'so' and わけ have an extremely close pattern of nuances, ranging from 'because', all the way through to simple emphasis (like with 'naturally', and 'as you'd expect'). わけ may also be used in questions, implying that the speaker is trying to determine something that they have heard. わけだね 'so its (A) right?', and わけ です か 'so is it that (A)?' are good examples of this.",N3
訳ではない,わけではない,,"It doesn't mean that, It is not the case, It's not like","As mentioned in the 訳 だ grammar point, わけ is a noun that is used for strong determination/conclusion in Japanese, in the same way that 'so' is in English. Naturally, this determination may sometimes be negative, as is the case with わけではない. ではない being the conjugated form of the auxiliary verb だ , the adverbial particle は, and the い-Adjective ない. わけではない may be translated as 'it doesn't mean that (A)', or 'it's not the case that (A)'. Although, 'it is not necessarily so that it's (A)', or 'so it's not (A)' are closer to the actual nuance of わけ. わけではない can be used at the end of any sentence, so long as the word before わけ is in attributive form . As always, では may be replaced by じゃ. Fun Fact わけだ and わけではない match the explanatory meaning of 'so' in English that often replaces words like 'because' and 'since'. However, as we will examine in more detail in the わけがない grammar point, わけ also matches the emphatic nuance of 'so', as can be seen in statements like 'it's SO not (A)'.",N3
訳には行かない,わけにはいかない,,"Cannot afford to, No way, Impossible to do","わけにはいかない is a statement that combines わけ 'to be so', 'reason', or 'cause', with the case marking particle に , the adverbial particle は, and the 'cannot go' meaning of 行 かない. It can be translated as 'cannot afford to (A)', or 'impossible to (A)'. However, the literal meaning is much closer to 'it cannot be so that (A)'. This structure will be used directly after the non-past form of verbs, in order to highlight them as being either highly undesirable, or highly unattainable. Although わけにはいかない primarily highlights things that are undesirable, it may also highlight something that is desirable, but impossible for some reason. This will depend largely on the speaker's tone of voice, and context of the conversation. In these types of sentences, the expression is quite similar to the 'I guess it's just not meant to be so' nuance that can be conveyed in English, highlighting regret.",N3
わざわざ,わざわざ,,"Expressly, Especially, Go out of one's way, Take the trouble to","わざわざ is an adverb that is used to express when someone has gone out of their way to achieve a certain result. It may be translated as 'expressly', 'especially', or 'to go out of one's way to (A)'. わざわざ will usually be used at the beginning of sentences, before some statement will be made about an activity that was intentionally done. わざわざ has a tendency to be used positively, although it may be used with negative connotations as well. Fun Fact Although almost never used, 態態 may be seen in this kanji form. 態 is a kanji used to express 'purpose', or 'intent'. Generally, it refers to someone's 'willingness' to do something. As such, わざわざ just expresses that (A) is something that the speaker has as a strong goal. How it will be translated depends more on whether the actual result is positive, negative, or undecided. Positive result - To purposefully do (A), with the result of (A). Negative result - To have every intention of (A), with the actual result of (B). Undecided result - To be intent on (A), with (A) hopefully happening. Caution わざと is a construction that comes from the same kanji as わざわざ. わざと generally only conveys 'on purpose', while わざわざ has many more potential meanings (due to being stronger).",N3
割に,割に,,"Although, Despite, Rather...for, Unexpectedly, Comparatively, Considering","As an adverb , 割 に is usually used in a similar way to 'although', 'despite', or 'comparatively' in English. 割 に may be used at the beginning of a sentence, or after any word/phrase that it is highlighting as being 'comparative'. When following な-Adjectives or nouns, な or の will be required. 割 itself is a noun meaning 'proportionate', and is primarily used as a suffix . 割 に may be thought of as a direct extension of this use, as 'proportionately' is its closest literal meaning. Fun Fact While 割 に is often thought to make comparisons between things, it actually only ever compares something to itself (or things within the same category). The 'proportion' that is then highlighted is something that is not common within the category of (A). Caution Both 割 と and 割 に are quite common expressions. However, 割 と is used far more often in casual speech to show that something is 'unexpectedly (A)'. It will also frequently be used as a stand-alone expression, appearing directly before the word (usually an adjective) that is of a 'considerable' amount.",N3
わ〜わで...,わ〜わ（で）,,"And...so, And...because, Since","As mentioned in the わ grammar point, わ is an adverbial particle that is commonly used in cases of stress of emphasis in Japanese. When used after either verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns in their standard forms , it generally implies that (A) and (B) are negative factors that have lead to (C), where (C) is either a negative outcome, or a negative opinion. It will often be translated simply as 'with (A) and (B), (C)'. To use this structure, simply place わ after a word, and then repeat the same after a second (different) word. In the case of な-Adjective or nouns, だわ will be used. The case-marking particle で will then follow the second わ, indicating 'with', or 'as a consequence of'. わ～わで , like わ , primarily emphasizes the speaker's surprise in regard to the words that appear before it. However, unlike わ , where the same verb will be repeated in order to highlight an excessive extent, わ～わで simply indicates surprise in terms of irritation or frustration. This structure is predominantly used by men, but it may also sometimes be used by women. However, there are several different variations of わ depending on where they appear in sentences, each of which have gender usage tendencies that will need to be learned. In essence, わ is used in the same way as し～し, where the words that they are being attached to are just being listed as reasons. Additionally, the で may occasionally be omitted. Fun Fact わ is simply an emphatic version of the usual は adverbial particle , and originates from は being changed to わ. Due to this, the literal meaning can be thought of as a stronger version of the standard 'as for (A)' meaning of は. Caution While this grammar pattern is used almost exclusively with a negative nuance, it may, in rare cases, have a positive nuance.",N1
わ〜わ~,わ〜わ,,"~and ~and, Keep ~ing, One after another, So much, So many, One after the other","わ is an adverbial particle that is commonly used in cases of stress of emphasis in Japanese. When appearing after the dictionary form of a verb that is being repeated, it highlights a large amount, something happening successively, or more and more. It will often be translated as 'more and more (A)', '(A) keeps on happening', or 'so much (A)'. わ～わ may be used either positively or negatively. To use this structure, simply place わ after the verb, and then repeat the same verb with a second わ . わ～わ primarily emphasizes the speaker's surprise in regard to the amount or extent of (A). This structure is predominantly used by men, but it may also sometimes be used by women. However, there are several different variations of わ depending on where they appear in sentences, each of which have gender usage tendencies that will need to be learned. In many cases where a する verb is being used with わ～わ , the second instance of the action will be omitted, with する appearing by itself. For example, instead of 勉強 する わ 勉強 する わ , 勉強 する わ する わ would be used. Fun Fact わ is simply an emphatic version of the usual は adverbial particle , and originates from は being changed to わ . Due to this, the literal meaning can be thought of as a stronger version of the standard 'as for (A)' meaning of は. This would come across something like 'as for (A), it did (A)', with the repetition itself adding to the emphasis.",N1
を良い事に,をいいことに,,To take advantage of,"を 良 いことに is an expression in Japanese that may be translated as 'to take advantage of (A)', and generally refers to someone that is using (A) as a good opportunity to do something that is either immoral, or irresponsible. This construction is a combination of を, the い-Adjective 良 い 'good', the noun こと 'thing', and the particle に. A more literal translation can be thought of as 'making good of (A), (B)', although the nuance is exactly the same as 'to take advantage of (A)' in English. を 良 いことに will be seen following verbs, nouns, い-Adjectives and な-Adjectives, but will be preceded by either の or なの in all cases, based on standard conjugation rules for の. It is also quite common to see して attached to the end of を 良 いことに without any significant change in either meaning or strength.",N1
を措いて他に〜ない...,をおいてほかに〜ない,,"No...but, Nothing else but, None other than","を 措 いて is a grammar pattern that expresses something similar to 'none other than (A)', or 'nothing else but (A)'. を 措 いて is a combination of the adverbial particle を, and the て-form of the う-Verb 措 く 'to set aside'. In this way, the literal meaning is similar to English phrases like 'setting aside (A), (B)', where (B) will be a broad statement about something that cannot be fulfilled by anything but (A). を 措 いて will follow nouns or noun phrases, and frequently have 他 にない directly after it, emphasizing the point that 'there is no other'. を 措 いて tends to only be used when the speaker positively evaluates (A), and is giving it praise in saying that nothing else can compare to it. Fun Fact As this grammar point regularly appears in hiragana, it may be helpful to remember that this uses 措 く 'to set aside', rather than 置く 'to place'. It may be easy to confuse these meanings, as they are very similar, and are classified as 同訓異字 . These are words that have the same kun-yomi reading, and also have a similar meaning. There are hundreds of examples of these in the language, so memorizing words with the same readings will help in identifying the meaning of new kanji at a later stage.",N1
を始め,をはじめ,,"Not only...but also..., Starting with","When presenting a topic in Japanese as a 'starting point', を 始 め will often be used to show any logic (or planned) progressions from that point. This is often translated as 'not only (A), but (B)', or 'starting with (A), (B)'. To use を 始 め , one noun will be highlighted as the starting point, before another (or several others) will appear in part (B) of the sentence. Due to sentences featuring をはじめ placing emphasis on (A) as a starting point, additional expressions such as として (or とする) will sometimes be paired with it. These structures function to further emphasize (A), and are similar to 'with (A) as the starting point, (B)'.",N3
をもって,をもって,,"As of, With, Effective from","When used with time related expressions, the structure をもって is often translated as 'as of (A)', or 'effective from (A)'. This grammar pattern is a construction of the adverbial particle を, and もって 'by means of'. をもって will be used after nouns that indicate a time, or an event that happens at a specific time. As is frequently seen in polite speech or in official notifications, をもって may sometimes be read as をもちまして . Alternatively, the small っ (called a 促音 ) may occasionally be dropped. This results in をもて. Caution Although 'effective from' can have the nuance of 'starting' in English, をもって primarily focuses on something ending, or what has happened up until the end date specified. Due to this, it will not be used to indicate that something is starting from a date that had nothing significant happen before it. Fun Fact Coming from the kanji 以 て, and specifically meaning 'by means of', もって originally derives its nuance from 持 って, 'to hold', or 'to have'. In this way, it may help to remember もって as working in a similar way to 'having (A)', or 'having reached (A)' in English.",N1
を元に,をもとに,,"Based on, From, According to","When linked to a noun, を 元 に is an expression that indicates that something is 'based on (A)', 'from (A)', or 'according to (A)'. This is a combination of を , the noun 元 'origin', and に . The literal meaning is similar to 'with (A) as the origin, (B)', and is used primarily to reference a source from which something is created or started. Most of the time, をもとに will be written without kanji, but it is also possible to see it as を 元 に . As this grammar pattern is mainly used to highlight an origin of creation, it will often be seen in sentences that use verbs like 書 く 'to write', できる 'to be able', and 作 る 'to make'. Caution - を 元 に 'based on' differs to に 基 づいて 'based on', in that に 基 づいて indicates a foundation from which the judgement or conclusion of (B) is made, while を 元 に focuses more on being a source of inspiration for (B), or enabling (B).",N2
をものともせず,をものともせず,,"Making nothing of, Ignoring, In defiance of, Regardless of, Disregarding","をものともせず is a combination of the adverbial particle を, the noun 物 'thing', the particle とも 'even as', and the negative form of する paired with classical auxiliary verb ず, せず. The common translations of 'to make nothing of (A)', or 'in defiance of (A)' are quite close to the more literal translation of 'without making (A) a thing'. As を must follow a noun, this expression may only be used after nouns, or nominated phrases. をものともせず will often follow negative words which are being praised as something that a person was not affected by 'did not make a thing of' in their response to it. Caution をものともせず will not be used when talking about one's own actions.",N1
を余所に,をよそに,,"Ignoring, Disregarding, Despite","を 余所 に is used to express that (A) is something that effectively has nothing to do with the speaker, or that the speaker is ignoring it in relation to something else. It may be translated as 'ignoring (A)', or 'disregarding (A)'. It is a combination of the adverbial particle を, the noun 余所 'other place', and the case-marking particle に. Due to this, its literal meaning is close to 'putting (A) completely aside, (B)'. This structure will follow nouns, or phrases that have been nominalized with の. It is reasonably formal, so will be seen more often in writing. The most common pattern for をよそに to follow is that (A) expresses some overall situation, while (B) indicates an action that is being done without any thought or care given toward those circumstances. Because of this, it is often used critically about actions that are seen as irresponsible. Caution While this grammar point will primarily highlight the actions of people, it will not be used to refer to the speaker's own actions.",N1
を中心に,を中心に,,"Focused on, Centered on or around, Mainly, Most notably","When combined with nouns, the expression を 中心 に indicates that something is being 'focused on' or 'centered around'. Occasionally, it may also be translated simply as 'mainly (A)', or 'most notably (A)'. 中心 itself is a noun that expresses the 'pivot', or 'central focus point' from which something else is occurring. The case marking particle に just marks '(A) を 中心 に ' as the target that is being focused on. Due to 中心 itself marking a 'central point', it may also be used just to express the middle of something, rather than something that is being concentrated or focused on. By adding する in either its dictionary or past forms, を 中心 にする or を 中心 にした may appear before another noun. This will highlight the noun that comes after as being the overall thing through which the 'focus on (A)' is taking place. Additionally, the case-marking particle と may sometimes replace に. This change will put more nuance on the focus point being conclusive, rather than progressive or decisive.",N2
を以て,を以て,,"By means of, With, By, Via, In view of","をもって is a formal grammar pattern stemming from the meaning of its kanji counterpart 以 て 'by means of'. It is used in a similar way to the case-marking particle で, and will be translated as 'with (A)', 'by (A)', 'via (A)', or 'by means of (A)'. As this structure is preceded by the particle を, it will only be used directly following nouns, or noun phrases. Despite being similar to で in meaning, をもって will generally not be used in regard to simple methods of doing something, such as 'traveling by train'. Due to this, the translation of 'by means of' is the most accurate, as it would only be used in situations where the speaker is trying to emphasize the means, like in English. In addition to this, it is not often used with concrete items, such as a fork or a hammer, but instead will appear alongside abstract concepts, like 'with sincerity', or 'with compassion'. Fun Fact をもってすれば is a commonly occuring pattern, and may be translated as 'going off the assumption that it were with (A)'.",N1
を余儀なくさせる,を余儀なくさせる,,"Force to, To compel, Make unavoidable","Like を 余儀 なくされる, a formal grammar pattern that is usually translated as ‘to be forced to (A)’, を 余儀 なくさせる has the same base, but uses the causative auxiliary verb させる ‘to make do’, in place of the passive される ‘to have done to one’. Its component parts are the adverbial particle を, the noun 余儀 ‘another method’, the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective ない, なく, and the causative form of する, させる. In this way, it literally means ‘to not give another way than to (A)’. を 余儀 なくさせる will be seen following an (A) noun, where (A) is the thing that is unavoidable. Unlike を 余儀 なくされる, in most cases the (A) subject of sentences that use を 余儀 なくさせる will be non-human cause. However, there are exceptions to this. Fun Fact Despite 余儀 and ない being separate words, 余儀 なく is often thought of simply as a single word that means ‘unavoidably’, or ‘inevitably’.",N1
を余儀なくされる,を余儀なくされる,,To be forced to do something,"を 余儀 なくされる is a formal grammar pattern in Japanese that is usually translated as 'to be forced to (A)'. Its component parts are the adverbial particle を, the noun 余儀 'another method', the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective ない, なく, and the passive form of する, される. In this way, it literally means 'to not be given another way than to (A)'. を 余儀 なくされる will be seen following an (A) noun, where (A) is the thing that is unavoidable. In most cases, the subject of sentences that use を 余儀 なくされる will be a person, or something that is representative of people, such as a company. However, there are exceptions to this. Caution Both を 余儀 なくされる 'to be forced to do' and を 余儀 なくさせる 'to force to do' are variations of the same grammar structure. を 余儀 なくさせる will be taught in a different lesson. Fun Fact Despite 余儀 and ない being separate words, 余儀 なく is often thought of simply as a single word that means 'unavoidably', or 'inevitably'.",N1
を兼ねて,を兼ねて,,"And also, Also (partly) to, Also (partly) for (the purpose of), At the same time, To double as, When … also, While … as well, And as","を 兼 ねて is a grammar pattern that makes use of the standard meaning of the る-Verb 兼 ねる 'to stretch across to', or 'to do concurrently'. The adverbial particle を will mark a noun which will be considered the secondary event or state, while 兼 ねて will be followed by the primary event or state that will be done concurrently with (A). This is often translated as 'to (A) at the same time as (B)', 'to double as (A)', or 'to (A) also partly for the purpose of (B)'. を 兼 ねて often highlights (B) as the primary goal, where (A) is something that acts to support it, makes sense to be done together, or just gives the speaker a good excuse to do (B). In order to remember that (A) is actually the secondary goal in this structure, using the literal translation of 'while extending across to (A), (B)' may help. In the case of multiple goals existing, the case-marking particle と will be used for listing of nouns.",N1
を前提に,を前提に,,On the premise of,"を 前提 に is a pattern that combines the adverbial particle を, the noun 前提 ‘premise’ or ‘hypothesis’, and the case-marking particle に. It is often translated as ‘on the premise of (A)’, and marks something as the base thought or goal toward which some other (B) action is being taken. This structure will be used following nouns, or verbs that have been nominalized with こと. Alternatively, either にして or として may be used in place of に by itself. This only slightly changes the nuance in the same way that is to be expected of these structures. を 前提 にして will sound more active as ‘toward the premise of (A), (B)’. While を 前提 として sounds more passive as ‘with (A) as the premise (B).",N1
を問わず,を問わず,,"Regardless of, Whether or not, No matter, With or without","を 問 わず is a pattern which makes use of the special-class う-Verb 問 う 'to inquire' and the literary auxiliary verb ず, which connects with verbs in the same way, and carries the same meaning as ない. While the literal meaning of this grammar structure is 'without questioning (A), (B)', it is used more as a formal way to express 'regardless of (A), (B)', 'whether (A) or not, (B)', or 'with or without (A)', (B)'. This structure is seen almost exclusively after nouns, but can also follow structures like か, or かどうか that are modifying adjectives. を will mark the 'question' which is 'not being asked'. Occasionally, は will replace を at the beginning of 問わず. This puts further emphasis on contrast, and slightly strengthens the phrase overall. Caution Although を 問 わず may be thought of as similar to 'regardless', there are actually situations where the nuance is closer to 'in any case for (A), (B)'. This is particularly true when (A) is being expressed as a scope. Let's compare を 問 わず to に 関 わらず to see the difference.",N2
を契機に,を契機に,,"Lead to, As a good opportunity to, As a result of, As a trigger","を 契機 に is a grammar construction made up of を, the noun 契機 'chance' or 'trigger' and に. It is a formal pattern that is used to indicate some sort of trigger and may be translated '(A) led to (B)', 'as an opportunity to (A), (B)', or 'as a result of (A), (B)'. (A) may either be a positive or negative event, but will usually be something extremely big in terms of life, or current/historical events in the world. を 契機 に will be seen after nouns, or verbs that have been nominalized with either の or こと. Alternatively, にして or として may replace に without any change in the overall meaning. Caution Unlike をきっかけに , を 契機 に will almost exclusively be used in relation to some turning point or critical juncture. Due to this, it can sound quite unnatural when used to express a trigger that would not be considered a big event.",N2
を巡って,を巡って,,"Concerning, In regard to, About, (Split) over","One of the more indirect ways that 'to be concerning (A)' is conveyed in Japanese is through the pairing of a noun with the case marking particle を and the う-Verb 巡 る 'to go around' in either its て-form, or standard form when paired with a second noun. This grammar point can be translated as 'concerning (A)', 'in regard to (A)', or 'about (A)'. However, following the most natural translation, we can see that 'to go around the topic of (A)', or 'encompassing (A)' are also acceptable. Caution In addition to being quite formal, を 巡 って keeps the 'around the topic of (A)' nuance that comes from the stem verb. This means that rather than expressing one opinion, it takes into consideration many different viewpoints, and is frequently used when there is a disagreement or dispute about (A). Because of this, it can sound quite unnatural to use を 巡 って if the topic of (A) is simply a personal opinion.",N2
を機に,を機に,,"Opportunity, Occasion","When used as a noun, 機 ‘opportunity’ indicates a time that is being used as suitable chance to do something. It is slightly formal and will usually be translated as ‘on the occasion of (A), (B)’. However, due to this grammar point being a construction of the adverbial particle を, 機 , and the case-marking particle に, it is indicating that the speaker is actively making use of the opportunity of (A)’. Due to this, it can be understood as ‘taking advantage of (A), (B)’, or ‘taking advantage of the time of (A), (B)’ on many occasions. を 機 に will directly follow nouns marking (A), before going on to explain how that (A) was utilized as an opportunity. を 機 に tends to be used most frequently when (B) is an action that the speaker is choosing to take primarily with (A) as the enabling factor, or being a good excuse.",N1
を皮切りに,を皮切りに,,"Beginning of, Starting with","を 皮切 りに is a grammar structure that will be utilized with nouns in order to show the starting point for something, from which it then expanded, or something kept happening after. In most cases, を 皮切 りに will just be translated as 'starting with (A)', or 'beginning with (A)'. This structure is a combination of the adverbial particle を, the noun 皮切 り 'beginning' or 'outset', and the case-marking particle に. It will appear after nouns or phrases that have been nominalized, before going on to explain how something continued to expand afterwards. In place of に by itself, にして and として are also standard variations of the same grammar pattern. Caution It is rare for を 皮切 りに to be used in relation to natural phenomena, or negative results. What happens as a result of (A) will usually be something positive, and have a specific 'doer'. Fun Fact Although 皮切 り is really only used to mean 'beginning', the kanji combination of 'to cut a hide' can be used as a helpful memory tool for the nuance of creating a starting point from which something expanded outwards over a large area, like skinning an animal.",N1
を禁じ得ない,を禁じ得ない,,"Cannot help feeling, Cannot but, Cannot hold back","を 禁 じ 得 ない is a formal grammar pattern used to express that one ‘cannot help feeling (A)’, or ‘cannot hold back from (A)’. It is primarily used connected to words that express emotions, or things that are the result of emotions, such as tears or laughter. This is a combination of the adverbial particle を, the conjunctive form of the る-Verb 禁 じる ‘to prohibit’, and the 得 ない pattern which means ‘to not gain’, but is used in a similar way to できない. を 禁 じ 得 ない will be seen following nouns, or occasionally verbs that have been nominalized with の. Caution This grammar pattern is almost exclusively used to express one’s own, first-person opinion. Due to this, it may sound unnatural if used to express other’s feelings.",N1
を経て,を経て,,"Via, Through, After (experience at job, university, etc.), Pass through","を 経 て is a fairly formal grammar point used when highlighting a passage of time, or an event that took a certain amount of time. 経 る itself is a る-Verb that means 'to elapse' or 'to pass' in terms of time. The difference between it and 過 ぎる 'to pass time' is that 過 ぎる focuses on having reached the end point, while 経 る focuses on what was happening for the whole period leading up to that end point. Because of this, を 経 て can also be translated as 'having undergone (A)', due to the emphasis being on the preceding action. を 経 て will directly follow nouns, and the rest of the sentence usually then goes on to describe the significance of that passage of time or experience, or what happened as a result. As it is a formal structure, を 経 て is often seen in biographies, introductions, and similar media.",N1
を踏まえて,を踏まえて,,"Based on, Considering, Keeping in mind, Taking into account, Therefore","踏 まえる is a る-Verb that means 'to tread firmly', but is often used figuratively in regard to taking things into account. Because of this, the combination of the adverbial particle を, and 踏 まえる in its て-form can frequently be translated as 'considering (A)', or 'keeping (A) in mind'. を 踏 まえて is primarily used in formal situations where (B) is an action being undertaken with (A) as the premise. As this structure begins with を, it will need to follow a noun. In this grammar pattern, the literal meaning of を 踏 まえて as 'being firmly planted' can be used equally as naturally, so long as its figurative nature is kept in mind.",N1
を込めて,を込めて,,"Full of, Filled with, With ～","をこめて , or を 込 めて when appearing in its kanji form, is a phrase that expresses when something is 'full of (A)', or 'filled with (A)'. The structure is comprised of を, and the て-form of the る-Verb 込 める, which means 'to pack into', or 'to load with'. In this way, the literal meaning is fairly consistent with the standard English translations. をこめて will appear directly after the noun expressing the particular feeling or emotion being discussed. Caution It is important to note that this particular structure is treated as a set phrase, and will primarily only be used when some particular feeling or emotion is the thing that is being 'packed into (A)'.",N2
を通じて,を通じて・を通して,,"Through, Via, Throughout","を 通 じて and を 通 して are two grammar patterns in Japanese that have very similar meanings to each other, and are used in many overlapping situations. Primarily, they can be thought of as meaning 'through (A), (B)', or 'via (A), (B)'. This 'through' may either indicate a method, or a location. 通 じる 'to flow', or 'to go through' and 通 す 'to make a path', only differ in that the former is intransitive, while the latter is transitive. Because of this, 通 じる will be seen more often in regard to information or communication where (A) is the connection through which (B) occurs. 通 す on the other hand more often refers to direct locations through which something is transferred or relocated. As this expression begins with を, it will appear after nouns, before expressing in the (B) part of the sentence exactly what was done 'through' (A). Caution The primary difference between を 通 じて and を 通 して lies in the intransitive and transitive nature of the verbs themselves. Due to this, things that are being done 'intentionally', or 'by use of (A)' will tend to use を 通 して . を 通 じて is more common when something is being done 'throughout (A)'.",N2
を限りに,を限りに,,"As of (the end of), (Starting) from, (No longer) after, By (the), Ending with","を 限 りに is a structure that follows nouns in order to express a time for which something that was continuing will finish by. Common interpretations include ‘ending with (A), (B)’, and ‘no longer than (A), (B)’. This grammar pattern makes use of the adverbial particle を, the noun 限 り ‘limit’, and the case-marking particle に. を 限 りに is primarily used for making proclamations or announcements, and is more formal than similar structures like 限 りで. Fun Fact Although を 限 りに almost always follows words indicating a specific time or place that is being viewed temporally, there is also the set expression 声 を 限 りに , ‘to the limit of one’s voice’ that breaks this usual rule.",N1
を除いて,を除いて,,"Except, With the exception of, Unless","を 除 いて is a formal grammar structure that combines を and the て-form of the う-Verb 除 く 'to exclude'. This pattern will be seen following nouns in their dictionary form, and carries the meaning of 'except for (A), (B)', 'with the exception of (A), (B)', 'unless (A), (B)', or 'excluding (A), (B)'. As with many verb-based expressions, the standard form may also be used when directly modifying a second noun. を 除 いて is more formal than 以外 'except for', and is frequently found in formal writing, on street signs, and other similar places.",N2
に任せる,～を～に任せる,,"Leave 〜 up to, Entrust 〜 to","(A) を (B) に 任 せる is a structure used to highlight that something is being 'entrusted' or 'left up to (B). This can be thought of as a standard function of the る-Verb 任 せる 'to entrust'. In (A) を (B) に 任 せる sentences, (A) を will identify the task, while (B) に will identify the person or thing that (A) is being left up to. Fun-fact Although this expression often highlights people that some task is being left up to, it is also frequently used when some eventuation or result is being left up to chance or fate.",N2
を,を,prt,Object marking particle,"In Japanese, を is a particle that marks the object of an action. This means that the subject (the person or thing performing an action) is performing that action with the object being the goal/target of the action. In most cases, whatever を is attached to will not actually be 'doing' anything, but will instead have something being done to it. In these sentences, を is marking the thing that is having an action performed 'on' it. This is how the Japanese language views the ' object '. However, unlike English, an object can also be a place in which an action is performed 'through', if the goal of that action is based in that location itself. In these sentences, を is marking the place 'through' which the action is taking place. This use of を highlights that the place itself is what is being interacted with (running/walking requires interaction with the ground, so the ground/place is the object).",N5
んが為に,んがため(に),,"In order to, To, For the purpose of","んがため is a grammar pattern used when indicating that something is being done 'for the purpose of (A)', or 'with (A) as the goal'. ん comes from an abbreviation of む, which is a classical auxiliary verb used to show intent or strong will in the same way as う and よう in modern Japanese. ん is then followed by が, and the noun ため 'sake', or 'purpose'. ん connects to the indeterminate form of verbs (ない stem). Either の or に will usually come after んがため , depending on whether it is followed directly by a noun, or a statement linking to a verb. The meaning of む is kept in ん, as this grammar structure will imply the speaker's will to achieve the goal of (A). As む expresses intent, the verb that ん is attached to must be something that can be controlled by the speaker. Caution Like most classical structures that interact with する, the more old-fashioned せ will be used as the base, rather than し.",N1
んじゃない',んじゃない,exp,"Don't, Mustn't, Shouldn't have","んじゃない is a slightly slang grammar pattern used with verbs to prohibit or request that something not be done. It will usually just be translated as 'don't do (A)', or 'you mustn't (A)'. んじゃない is almost always used from a higher position toward someone of a lower status. It may be used when the speaker is angry, but not always. んじゃない is a combination of the case-marking particle の, and the abbreviated form of ではない, じゃない. It will connect to the dictionary form of verbs. Despite being slang, the slightly more formal version んじゃありません can also be seen occasionally. This variation is common when the speaker wants to forbid something, but not sound angry, such as when an adult is talking to a child. The more literal translation of Verb + んじゃない is just 'it's not (verb)'. This sounds a bit strange in English, but might be similar to something like 'you're not (verb)', where a person is directly telling another what they shouldn't do. It is also common to see the abbreviated ている form, てん, before じゃない. Caution When used in the past tense, んじゃなかった indicates that something 'should not have been done', and has a nuance of regret or disappointment that the action occurred. Caution When んじゃない comes at the end of a sentence, it will be important to listen to the intonation, as the statement may actually be a question. In this case, it is an abbreviation of んじゃないか. The difference between these two uses of んじゃない will usually be very clear. A question has a rising intonation, while an order will have a dropping intonation.",N3
んだけど,んだけど・んですが,,"But..., And...","んだけど is an expression that combines んだ (explaining/giving cause), with けど (but). Together they translate simply as 'but...', although the nuance is actually closer to 'but with (A) as the reason… (B)', while (B) is sometimes left unsaid. This implies that the speaker is looking for a reply, or does not want to say the (B) part of the sentence out of politeness/awkwardness. There are several different forms of this construction that are mostly interchangeable with each other. From most casual, to most formal, they are as follows: んだけど 、 んだけれど 、 んだけれども 、 んだが 、 んですが ん may be replaced with の in any of the above expressions. However, it will again make it slightly more formal. Caution んだが , or simply だが is probably the 'strongest' out of these possibilities, and is considered quite masculine. If you are going to use this form, we recommend making sure that your tone is a bit softer, so that it does not sound too authoritative. Fun Fact ん (or の) may sometimes be omitted completely, but this is not so common in modern Japanese.",N4
んだって,んだって,,"I heard that, He or She said that","When used at the end of sentences, だって often expresses something that has been heard by the speaker. This particular use of だって will always be paired with ん or なん. As だって is a grouping of the auxiliary verb だ , and the adverbial particle って, なんだって primarily expresses the following: なん - Presents an explanation. だ - Determines something to be true. って - An abbreviation of と 言 って 'is said' or と 思 って 'is thought'. In this way, it translates quite similarly to 'it is that (A) was said/thought'. Realistically though, it is used in the same way as 'I heard that (A)', or 'it's thought that (A)'. Caution なんだって usually comes across as being quite casual, so is best used in conversations with friends.",N3
んばかりに,んばかりに,,"As if, As if it were about to, About to","Like とばかりに, んばかりに is a construction that is often used to show that something is being done 'as if it were (A)', or 'seeming that it will (A)'. It is thought to be a combination of ん, an abbreviation of む, the classical auxiliary verb used to show intent or strong will in the same way as う and よう, and the adverbial particle ばかり, exhibiting that something is 'basically exactly as described'. As a result, んばかり simply indicates the volitional form of (A) as appearing to be about to happen. んばかりに will appear linked to the indeterminate form of verbs (ない stem), and then followed by a statement that is being modified by the に. If んばかり will modify a noun instead, の will replace に. Caution When attached to the indeterminate form of verbs, there is some contention among linguists whether ん is an abbreviation of む, the classical way of expressing う or よう, or whether it is an abbreviation of ぬ, the classical way of expressing ない. Due to being unable to accurately determine what the actual origin is, it would be advisable to choose whichever variation helps to remember the nuance of the grammar point on a case-by-case basis.",N1
一体(),一体,,"(What) the heck?, (Who) in the world?, (Where) on earth?, (How many) f*ing...","In order to convey the feeling of 'what the heck', with any 'how', 'what', 'where' or 'why' type question, the adverb 一体 will be used in Japanese. いったい appears frequently both with, and without kanji. いったい will usually be seen at the beginning of sentences, before some statement about what the speaker finds unbelievable. The literal meaning of いったい is 'one body', or 'one form'. In this way, when paired with questions, いったい can be thought of meaning 'in a way that can be understood, what is (A)', or 'in a way that makes sense, what is (A)'. Fun Fact Like the 'one body', or 'one form' meaning mentioned above, 一体 is sometimes used to mean 'in general', or 'generally' when seen as 一体 に. However, this use is slowly becoming less common, partly due to how often 一体 is used simply to express surprise or shock.",N3
一応①,一応,,"Just in case, Just to be sure","When used as an adverb , 一応 can often carry the nuance of (A) not being perfect, but the minimum required in order to prevent (B). This particular nuance of 一応 may be interpreted as 'just in case, (A)', or 'just to be sure (A)'. When 一応 is used this way, it frequently highlights that (B) happening is unlikely, but the precautionary measure of (A) might be a good idea to avoid it. This is in contrast to another common use of 一応 which can be translated as 'more or less', or 'for the time being'. However, in both of its uses, it simply indicates the minimum amount of (A) which is fulfilling some requirement.",N2
一応②,一応,,"more or less, for the time being, tentatively・roughly","When used as an adverb , 一応 can often carry the nuance of (A) not being perfect or ideal, but the minimum required in order to satisfy some requirement. This 'requirement' is frequently related to the time or amount of something. When used this way, 一応 may be interpreted as 'more or less, (A)', 'for the time being, (A)', or 'tentatively (A)'. This use of 一応 is in contrast to the other common use of 一応 , which can be translated as 'just in case', or 'just to be sure'. In these cases, the speaker is usually indicating that (A) is being done in order to avoid or prevent (B). However, in both of its uses, it simply indicates that (A) is the minimum amount which is fulfilling some requirement.",N2
一方だ,一方だ,,"More and more, Continue to, Keep on, -er and -er","一方 is a noun that is often seen after verbs, in order to convey the meaning of 'more and more (A)', 'continuing to (A)', or 'getting (A)er and (A)er'. 一方 will be paired with the auxiliary verb だ (at the end of sentences), or で, だ's conjunctive form when it will be followed by some sort of explanation. As the literal meaning of 一方 is 'single direction', it may be used with things that are increasing, decreasing, intensifying, or weakening, so long as the shift is all in a single direction. Caution 一方 may only be used with verbs that express some kind of change, as 一方 itself does not express change, just a continuing direction.",N3
一方で,一方で,,"On the other hand, At the same time, While","一方 で is a combination of the noun 一方 'one direction', and the case marking particle で, in its nuance as 'at'. Together, they are used in a similar way to a conjunction particle , carrying the meaning of 'on the other hand', 'at the same time', or 'while'. 一方 で may be used after the attributive form of other words, or at the beginning of new phrases. As 一方 で has a literal meaning similar to 'at the (A) side', or 'in the (A) direction', it is expressing that another direction also exists, which may then be compared or contrasted with (A). Caution Do not confuse 一方 で , with 一方 だ (or で in its conjunctive form). The expression that uses the で particle means 'at one direction/side', while the expression that utilizes the auxiliary verb だ (or で in its conjunctive form) means 'in one direction'. The overall context of the sentence will usually reveal whether the conjunctive form of だ (で) is being used, or the actual で particle.",N3
一旦,一旦,,"Once …, If … for a short time, Temporarily (stop), For now or the time being","一旦 , an adverb meaning 'for a short time', or 'briefly', is a structure that is used in Japanese to indicate that 'once (A), (B)'. This particular meaning comes from the inclusion of hypothetical structures such as ば, と, or たら, and will usually appear with a negated verb in the (B) part of a sentence. 一旦 based sentences will indicate that returning to the previous state will be difficult, at least for a short time. Other common translations include 'for the time being', and 'for now'. 一旦 will primarily appear at the beginning of sentences, or directly before a ば, と, or たら modified verb. Fun-fact 一旦 originally comes from the noun 一旦 meaning 'one morning', or 'one brief period'. The 旦 kanji itself signifies 'daybreak' or 'dawn'. In this way, it can be a useful memory tool to remember 一旦 as the 'dawning' of some period that will not end until it has run its own natural course.",N2
万が一,万が一,,"Just in case, In the worst-case scenario, In the unlikely event, By any chance","万 が 一 , or sometimes simply 万一 is a grammar pattern that literally means '1 in 10000'. It is used in a similar way to phrases such as 'in the unlikely event of (A)', or 'just in case (A)' in English, and will usually highlight some measure against (A), or what will happen as a result of (A) in the latter half of the sentence. 万 が 一 is primarily used adverbially, so will often come at the beginning of sentences. Fun-fact 万 が 一 is considered slightly stronger than 万一 , but 万 が 一 is far more common due to it being easier to pronounce.",N2
上がる,上がる・上げる,,"Something is finished, To finish something, Something has come to an end, To do something completely, To do something through","When used after the conjunctive form of a verb, either of the verbs 上 げる 'to raise', or 上 がる 'to rise' may be used. They will convey that something has been done 'to the limit'. 上 がる will be used for actions that take place by themselves (intransitive), while 上 げる will be used for actions that have an instigator (transitive). Although 上 げる and 上 がる show that something has been done 'to the limit', the nuance is usually 'to do (A) to the point of completion', or 'to do (A) through to the end'. Therefore, the 'limit' that is being highlighted is usually a natural ending, and not due to running out of some kind of resource. Let's have a look at some examples. 上 げる and 上 がる are most commonly used when some kind of effect or product is produced as a result of the (A) action. In these cases, the literal meaning of 'to (A) up' is very similar to 'to finish up (A)' in English. Caution 仕上 がる is a very common expression that is used for many things. Usually it conveys that something has been completed after some involved or time consuming process.",N3
上で,上で,,"After, Upon","上 で is an expression in Japanese that is used after the past form of verbs, or nouns followed by の. It shows that something will happen 'after (A)', or 'upon (A)'. This grammar point is used in a similar way to its literal meaning, which is 'with the above/previous (A), (B)'. 上 as 'above', and で as 'with', in で's use as a case marking particle . 上 で is a structure that is primarily used in formal settings. Due to this, it will not be used in casual conversations very often. It also strongly hints at (A) being a requirement for (B), or (A) being something that would logically be expected before (B). Caution Due to 上 で being used to show logical progressions from (A) to (B), (A) cannot be a verb that is passive. Passivity in Japanese often implies that someone/thing has a lack of control in relation to the actions that happen to them/it. As a result of this, (A) not being able to be controlled would result in (B) sounding like it could not be planned for. This is different to the way that passivity works in English (simply showing that something received an action upon it).",N3
上に,上に,,"As well, Besides, In addition to","上 に is a grammar pattern that functions as a slightly formal way of saying 'and' in Japanese. It shows that something is 'in addition to (A)', 'as well as (A)', or 'besides (A)'. Literally, it simply shows that 'on top of (A), (B)'. 上 に may be used after that standard form of verbs and い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives followed by な 上 に , and nouns followed by の 上 に . Occasionally, the に may be dropped from this structure, without changing the meaning at all. When it comes to な-Adjectives and nouns, it is also common to see である 上 に used as a conjugation pattern. Caution 上 に must always be used to highlight qualities of things that are equivalent to each other. For example, a good thing and another good thing, or a bad thing and another bad thing.",N2
上は,上は,,"Once, Since, Now that, As long as","A fairly old-fashioned phrase, 上 は highlights that something is being done or considered as a result of (A). It may be interpreted as 'once (A), (B)', 'since (A), (B)', 'now that (A), (B)', or 'as long as (A), (B)'. In these meanings, (B) will always be something that is deemed as either obvious or necessary. 上 in this phrase is a noun , and will be attached to the adverbial particle は. This creates a literal meaning that is similar to 'over and above (A), (B)'. This 'over and above' has a similar nuance to 'with that said', or 'all things considered' in English, and just presents (A) as something that is finalized. This structure follows verbs in the standard form . Due to 上 は being quite old-fashioned, expressions like からには or 以上 は will be heard more frequently in modern-day Japanese, and will carry a similar meaning.",N2
上,上,,From the standpoint of,"Attaching to nouns, 上 is a suffix that highlights when something is being presented 'from the standpoint of (A)'. The 'standpoint' that 上 will indicate is usually a specific field or area of concern. The (B) part of the sentence will then go on to describe what exactly is being considered from that standpoint. 上 is fairly formal, and can be interpreted similarly to に 関 して 'in connection to', in that it is just expressing that (B) is being discussed in relation to (A). As 上 will be used with matters of concern, it is very frequently seen with words that express broad fields, such as work ' 仕事 ', 'education' 教育 , 'history' 歴史 , 'health' 健康 , 'experience' 経験 , 'the law' 法律 , and other similar things. Caution Despite expressing standpoints, 上 cannot be used to indicate an individual person's point of view. Because of this, it cannot be used as a suffix for names of people or organizations that something is being considered from.",N2
並み,並み,,"As, On par with, Worthy of","並 み is the noun form of the classical verb 並 む, which has the same meaning as 並 ぶ, ‘to line up’, or ‘to be in line’. It will be used following nouns, and may be interpreted as ‘on par with (A)’, ‘worthy of (A)’, or ‘as standard for (A)’. However, the literal translation of ‘in line with (A)’ also works just as well in many cases. Caution Although 並 み may occasionally have the meaning of ‘as standard for (A)’ as a suffix, the ‘average’ or ‘ordinary’ meaning is often reserved for when 並 み is used by itself as a noun. In these cases it will usually be written as 並 , and be followed by the case-marking particle の, and then a second noun marking what the average is. Caution 並 み may only be used in sentences where (A) has a standard or norm that is well recognized, or easily identifiable. In cases where the ‘norm’ would change based on an individual’s opinion, rather than what the actual standard is, it will sound unnatural.",N1
中を,中を,,"In, On, Into, Inside of","Coming from the base meaning of the noun 中 meaning 'inside', the addition of the case marking particle を in its role of identifying the place where an action is taking place creates a grammar structure that can be translated as 'doing (B) in (A)', 'doing (B) on (A)', or 'doing (B) inside of (A)'. With this grammar point, (B) will be the action, while (A) will be a noun indicating the location. Caution The person or thing that is doing the action that 中 を is indicating may not actually be within the noun being marked with (A). A good example of this is 'doing (B) into (A)', such as with the う-Verb 覗 く 'to peer'.",N2
中,中,,"During, While, Throughout, In the process of","As a suffix , 中 is frequently used to highlight a period of time (or space). By attaching the case marking particle に , the sentence can be modified, to show that (B) is happening/existing throughout the timeframe/space of (A). This is often translated as 'throughout (A), (B)', or 'during (A), (B)'. First, let's take a look at 中 being used to show events that are in process. Now, to show that a (B) event is happening within (A), simply add the case marking particle に to show a 'temporal location'. This will be done by attaching に to the end of any noun that you would like to indicate as the being the 'space' within which another thing exists/occurs. In these examples, we can see that 中 に is sometimes read/said as 中 に. The basic rule for when to use ちゅう or when to use じゅう is as follows: 中 に - Expresses a very specific (usually small) amount of time/space, or something that is not always the same (an amount of time/space that can change, depending on the person/situation). This 'thing' that ちゅう highlights is usually a 'process', and therefore means that (A) is 'in the process' of happening. Examples - A meeting, class, visit to somewhere. 中 に - Expresses a predetermined amount of time/space that will always remain the same, regardless of the person/situation. Therefore, じゅう does not highlight a 'process', but focuses on the 'length' or 'space' itself. This tends to mean 'all throughout', as it focuses on the full amount of time/space. Examples - A day, year, house, town or country. Caution There is also a difference between 音読 み (chinese readings of words), and 訓読 み (japanese readings of words). じゅう is used more frequently with 訓読 み - ( 今年中 , 夏休 み 中 , 今晩中 ). ちゅう is used more frequently with 音読 み - ( 水中 , 会議中 , 試合中 ).",N3
代わりに,代わりに,,"Instead of,  In place of, In exchange for","代 わり 'a substitute' is a noun that is used to convey when (B) is acting as a replacement or substitute for (A). The case marking particle に will come after 代 わり, before a (B) statement will highlight who the replacement is, and possibly what they are doing. As 代 わり is a noun, it may be used after the attributive form of any word. Occasionally, 替 わり 'to exchange' may be used instead of 代 わり 'to substitute'. However, within the context of this particular grammar structure, there is little to no change in nuance. Fun Fact 代 わりに is often used at the beginning of sentences, simply to express a more preferable option for something. In these cases, it comes across as 'rather than that, (A)', or 'instead, (A)'.",N3
代,～代,,"Teens, Twenties, Thirties, 1910s, 20s/30s","The suffix ～ 代 is used for several different things. One of the most common uses is for highlighting someone's decade of age. In the same way that English says teens, twenties, and thirties. All that is required is adding 代 after the age (in tens), in Japanese. In addition to someone's decade of age, ～ 代 can be used to express a chronological decade, such as the 1960's, 70's, or 80's. In these cases, 年 代 will be used after the decade. Fun Fact 代 is also regularly seen when marking eras of time, or generations of people within a specific family/political position.",N4
以上に,以上に,,"More than, No less than, Even more","Like other structures that include 以上 'beyond', 以上 に highlights that (A) is beyond some specific extent. In this grammar pattern, the case marking particle に will indicate the word that 以上 に is attached to as an amount. With (A) being considered as 'beyond' something, 以上 に can be translated as 'more than (A)', or 'even more than (A)'. 以上 に may be used after verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns in their standard forms. Occasionally, に may be replaced by の when a specific amount or quantity is being indicated with a second noun. The noun attached to の may not always obviously be an 'amount', but it is something that the speaker is 'measuring' in regard to (A).",N2
以上①,以上,,"More than (or equal to), Over・(and) above, Any more・Greater, Exceeding","In order to mark something as 'equal to, or more than (A)', 以上 will be used. This is simply a combination of the kanji 以 which means 'by means of', and 上 'above'. This expression may also be translated as 'greater than (A)', or 'exceeding (A)'. To use 以上 , attach it to the amount that you want to highlight as the 'minimum' amount. 以上 is also regularly used as a statement that translates roughly as 'the end', or 'that's it', and is a very common way to say that something has finished. Although saying 'the end' would sound a bit rude in English in this situation, it is completely natural in Japanese, and literally means 'the above (list of things I said) is all'.",N4
以上②,以上,,"Since, Now that, As long as, If","When combined with the adverbial particle は, 以上 is frequently translated as 'since (A), (B)', 'now that (A), (B)', or 'as long as (A), (B)'. This is a formal structure that is rarely found in daily speech. This construction may be used with verbs and い-Adjectives in their standard forms, and な-Adjectives or nouns followed by である 以上 は . As with many other grammar points, the particle is often dropped, leaving 以上 by itself. Due to である 以上 は often presenting something which is being acted upon, the (B) part of sentences that include this grammar structure will frequently include the resolutions or intentions of the speaker, and can be thought of as either obvious or necessary once considering (A). This usually appears in the form of べきだ, つもりだ, はずだ, たい, ほうがいい, and similar patterns. Fun-fact Despite the standard translations, the literal meaning of 'above and beyond (A), (B)' is also a good way to remember this grammar pattern, as it basically highlights that anything 'past', 'beyond', or 'above' (A) is what needs to be considered.",N2
以前,以前,,"Before, Not even, Before even, Precede, Far from","When used as a suffix, the noun 以前 ‘preceding’, or ‘prior to’ will indicate that a topic is being brought forward as not even fulfilling the minimum requirements of (A), and therefore is expected to be reached before that minimum. Often, this will come across as ‘before even (A)’ in English, and is used to criticize something that is thoughtless or irresponsible. 以前 will appear directly after another nouns, the dictionary form of verbs, い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives. In most cases, 以前 will be followed by either the case-marking particle に or の, depending on whether it is being linked to a subsequent verb or noun. The word 以前 itself is usually reserved for highlighting larger distances in the past than 前 ‘before’ by itself, and can therefore simply be thought of as an emphatic version of 前 . This emphasis is often what gives rise to the tone of criticism. As it is stating that ‘way before (A), (B)’, or ‘long before you even think of (A), (B)’.",N1
以来,以来,,"Since, Henceforth","When the noun, 以来 'ever since' is paired with the て-form of verbs, or with nouns, it indicates that (B) is something that has continued non-stop since (A), or will continue non-stop from (A). This may be interpreted as 'since (A)', 'henceforth', or 'ever since (A)'. The key point of 以来 is that it indicates an ongoing state. Due to this, it focuses on (B) being something that will continue non-stop until a change is caused externally. Caution Occasionally, 以来 may also be used to express a specific number of (B) that has occurred since (A). While this use is closer to 'since', it still just indicates that 'in total', (B) has occurred 'ever since (A)'. This will place a stronger emphasis on the amount of (B) being shocking in some way than a simpler structure like から.",N2
何から何まで,何から何まで,,"Everything and anything, From A to Z, From head to toe, Everything","何 から 何 まで is a set phrase that may be interpreted in a very similar way to expressions like 'everything from A to Z', 'everything and anything', or 'from head to toe' in English. Being a construction of 何 'whatever', から 'from', 何 'whatever', and まで 'until', the literal meaning is similar to 'from whatever to whatever', and just indicates that there is no limit to what is included in a certain category. This expression is often used in a similar way to adverbs, meaning that it will appear at the beginning of a sentence, before describing the situation further. 何 から 何 まで is also frequently used in a similar way to 'absolutely everything' in English, and will appear in phrases where the speaker is expressing thanks or gratitude to someone for all that they have done.",N2
何しろ,何しろ,,"No wonder, After all, In fact, Because, At any rate","Although a combination of the substitute noun 何 and the imperative form of する, しろ, 何 しろ is often considered to be a singular adverb that carries the meaning of 'no wonder', or 'after all'. A more literal translation would be something like 'whatever the case, (A)', and just expresses that in any circumstance, only one conclusion can accurately be drawn in regard to (A). 何 しろ will frequently appear at the beginning of a sentence, or at the start of the second clause. 何 しろ will regularly be seen partnered with statements including words like から or ので, in order to emphasize an explanation or reason as to why (A) is the way it is.",N2
何と言っても,何といっても,,"By any account, All the same, No doubt","何 といっても is an expression that is used in almost exactly the same way in Japanese as it is in English, and qualifies that 'no matter what is said, (A)', or 'by any account, (A)'. Being a mix of the substitute noun 何 'what', or 'whatever', と, the て-form of the う-Verb 言 う 'to say', and も, the literal meaning is also 'even whatever one can say (A)'. 何 といっても is used primarily at the beginning of sentences, and frequently highlights something that is a positive aspect of (A). Like many uses of 何 , the pronunciation change to 何 is simply for ease of speech. Despite being used mainly in positive situations, 何 といっても may occasionally appear with a negative nuance as well, although this is far less common.",N2
何より,何より,,"Be glad, Be relieved, Most, Best, Above all else, More than anything","何 より , or 何 よりも when emphasized, is a common phrase in Japanese that is used when one wants to express that they are 'glad', 'relieved', or that '(A) is more important than anything'. As this structure is simply a combination of the substitute noun 何 'what', or 'whatever', and the particle より 'than', the closest literal translation is 'more than anything, (A)'. 何 より is primarily used to express positive feelings when the actual situation may have been worse, but (A) is the most important. 何 より , and 何 よりも most often behave adverbially, meaning that they can be used at the beginning of a sentence, or right before the word they are describing. However, they occasionally come directly before a noun when followed by の. As in most cases, も just strengthens the phrase slightly, with no other significant change in nuance.",N2
傾向がある,傾向がある,,"Tendency, Trend, Inclination","傾向 がある is a slightly formal grammar pattern used when indicating that there is some sort of 'trend' or 'tendency' existing within (A). Being a combination of the noun 傾向 'inclination', and がある 'to have', the literal meaning is almost identical to the standard English interpretation. As 傾向 itself is a noun, this structure may appear after verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives followed by な, and nouns followed by の. Although がある is the most frequent structure seen with 傾向 , alternatives such as が 見 られる 'the trend of (A) can be observed' are also widely used. It should also be noted that 傾向 がある may be used both in instances where the trend is either positive or negative. Caution 傾向 がある tends to express behaviors or characteristics (static things that aren't actively changing), while 傾向 にある focuses more on being in a state of something that is ongoing or proceeding in a certain direction, such as a declining trend.",N2
僅かに,僅かに,,"Only, Slightly, A little, Barely, Merely","僅 か is a な-Adjective in Japanese that is often used adverbially at the beginning of sentences in order to indicate an excessively small amount of something. 僅 か itself may be translated as 'trifling', or 'meager', with the adverbial variant being interpreted as 'merely', 'barely', or 'slightly'. As an adverb, 僅 か will appear as 僅 かに . Due to 僅 か highlighting an extremely small amount of something, it is often used when the speaker is trying to be modest in indicating that something is nothing more than a trifling amount, such as the difference between their and another's opinions. Fun Fact 僅 か may also be used simply as a noun without the case-marking particle に following it. In these cases, it will just mean ‘a meager thing’, ‘a trifle’, ‘an insignificance’, or any other such word that indicates something that is exceptionally small in size or number.",N2
全く～ない~,全く～ない,,Not~at all,"全く～ない is an expression that combines the adverb 全 く, with a phrase that uses another word in its ない form. It is often translated as 'not at all (A)'. Literally, it is closer to 'completely not (A)', or 'entirely not (A)', coming from the kanji 全 's meaning of 'whole'. Like many other adverbs, まったく may be used at the beginning of a sentence, or directly before the word that it is describing as being 'not at all' (A). It is common to see this expression using both the kanji form, and plain hiragana form of 全 く, so both should be learned early. Caution まったく is very similar to 全然 , another grammar point that is used to highlight the complete lack of something. However, まったく tends to sound a little bit more serious, and is therefore more likely to be used in formal writing/situations. 全然 on the other hand is far more common in casual speech.",N3
再び,再び,,"Again, Once more, A second time","再 び is an adverb that means 'to repeat'. It is regularly translated as 'again', 'once more', or 'a second time'. Usually, 再 び will appear at the beginning of a sentence, before some sort of request or statement will be made about what needs to be repeated. Despite meaning 'to repeat', 再 び specifically has the nuance of repeating something 'for the second time'. Because of this, it will not be used to highlight things that need to be repeated over and over again. Caution Unlike また, which is frequently used to express 'again', 再 び is quite formal, and will be seen far more often in books/articles, than it will be spoken.",N3
切る,切る,,"To do something completely to the end, Utterly, Resolutely","Another verb that is often seen used after the conjunctive form of other verbs is the う - Verb 切 る 'to cut'. 切 る will give the (A) verb the nuance of being done 'to completion'. However, the 'completion' that is being conveyed with 切 る is usually caused by the running out of some kind of resource, like energy. Due to this, 切 る is often translated as 'to do (A) to the point of being unable to continue' (or not needing to continue), or 'to totally and utterly do (A)'. Occasionally, 切 る may also be used to show that (A) is being done at 'full pelt', 'full steam', or 'full capacity'. In these cases, it is similar to 'to resolutely do (A)', and just means that 100% effort is being put into the action.",N3
切れない,切れない,,Being unable to finish or complete,"In the negative-potential form, 切 れない will attach to the conjunctive form of other verbs, to express that a particular action is 'unable to be completed'. Let's look at some examples. Unlike 切 る , which usually attaches to verbs to show that something was done to the point of running out, 切 れない often implies the exact opposite. This means that the (A) verb cannot be completed specifically because there is too much/many of something in order to finish it. 切 れない may also imply that something cannot be done 'to the point of satisfaction'. In this case, the feeling of dissatisfaction is what the speaker considers too much to overcome.",N3
別に～ない,別に〜ない,,"Not really, Not particularly, It's not like...","When paired with ない (either the い-Adjective or the auxiliary verb), the adverb 別 に 'separately' changes slightly in definition to that of 特 に 'especially'. Let's have a look at a few examples. This 'especially' nuance of 別 に comes from 'separately' being negated. The literal meaning of 別 に～ない is something like '(A) cannot be separated/differentiated'. This comes across as 'maybe it is a little (A), maybe a lot (A), but in any case, it cannot be said that it IS (A)'. Caution 別 に will quite often be paired with わけではない , as they both express uncertainty. However, it should never be paired with わけがない , as this would be combining a statement that removes certainty, with one that adds certainty.",N3
前者は～後者は,前者は・後者は,,"The former ~ the latter, The first ~ the second","Used in almost exactly the same way as 'the former' and 'the latter' in English, 前者 and 後者 are two nouns that appear frequently in Japanese. The adverbial particle は will appear after these words, to express contrast between the two. 前者 will be used for 'the former', while 後者 will represent 'the latter'. Both 前者 and 後者 appear at the beginning of their own statements, with a specific comment about each being made after は. Caution Statements made that use 前者 and 後者 require some sort of relationship in what is being compared. Usually, this will be obvious within the context of the sentence, but is something that you will need to be careful of when making your own sentences.",N3
化する,化する,,"-ification, -ization, To make something, To change, To become, Transform into","化 by itself is a suffix in Japanese which means 'to change', or 'to transform'. When paired with する , it means 'to transform into (A)', where (A) is the noun that 化 is connected to. This structure is regularly translated as '~ification', or '~ization', and similar suffixes in English. When the する is connected to another noun, it may occasionally appear as した, or with の attached to the end of it. This will indicate that there is a relationship between (B) and (A). However, in formal/scientific writing, the する (and の ) may sometimes be dropped.",N4
即ち,即ち,,"In other words, That is, Namely","In a similar way to つまり , 即 ち is another grammar pattern in Japanese that is often translated as 'in other words'. It may also be translated as 'namely', or 'that is to say'. While 即 ち is an adverb , it is often used as a conjunction , linking two sentences via some sort of reasoning. Caution The kanji used in 即 ち simply means 'in concordance'. This shows that the nuance associated with 即 ち is that of 'agreeance' or 'correspondence' to something else, while つまり is purely that of 'summarisation'.",N3
却って,却って,,"All the more, On the contrary, Conversely","In order to revoke, or take a step back from a statement that has already been made, 却 って will often be used. 却 って can translate as 'rather', or 'all the more'. If a sentence consists of '(A) 却 って , (B)', what it means is 'putting aside (A), (B)'. 却 って is an adverb . 却 って itself translates most closely to 'instead'. However, this is not the 'instead' used for phrases like '(B) was chosen over (A)', but the 'instead' used for phrases like '(A) couldn't be achieved, so (B)'. This shows that (A) is usually the intention or aim of the speaker, but (B) was the result instead. Fun Fact Another reading of the kanji used in 却 って is 却 く, which means 'to retreat'. This further highlights 却 って 's nuance of 'stepping away' from the (A) statement, to show the real result of (B).",N3
又〜も,又〜も,,"Moreover, Additionally, And also, In addition, Furthermore, Or","又 ～も is a combination of the adverb 又 , a noun, and the adverbial particle も. It can be translated as 'moreover', 'additionally', or 'furthermore'. As も is being used, whatever is being said in (B) will usually be new information. To use 又 ～も, an (A) phrase will be stated, before 又 will open the (B) phrase, and then be followed by a noun + も. Instead of も, でも or ても may be used for extra emphasis. Fun Fact The kanji 又 and 叉 share an interesting relationship. 又 is used to refer to things that reach a point of separation, but then fold back on themselves (being translated as 'again', or 'in addition'). On the other hand, 叉 refers to things that reach a point of separation, and then split (being translated as 'a fork in the road', or 'crotch').",N3
反面,反面,,"While, On the other hand, Although, However, On the flip side","反面 , a noun meaning 'the opposing side', is a construction in Japanese that appears between two phrases, to show two contrasting or opposite features of a single person or thing. This usually translates as 'while (A), (B)', 'although (A), also (B)', 'on the other hand to (A), (B)'. Being a noun, 反面 , can be used after any word that could create a modified noun, such as verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or even other nouns followed by である. Caution Because 反面 is used to express contradictions, it will most often describe a positive and a negative, but cannot describe a positive and another positive, or a negative and another negative.",N2
各,各,,"Each, Every, Respective, Various","One of the slightly more formal ways to say that something is happening 'each', or 'every' (A) in Japanese, is by using the prefix 各 . While there is no strict rule for when this prefix can be used, it is almost always seen before words of Chinese origin (kanji compounds), or katakana words. Although this kanji is used to mark 'each', it is very rarely used to mark units of time. The most common/natural usage of 各 is for identifying things that are part of a sequence. For example: Each/Every stop, on a train line that has many stops. Each/Every page, in a book that has many pages. Each/Every floor, in a building that has many floors. Each/Every house, in a street of many houses. Fun Fact This kanji is used in another word, 各々 , which also means 'each', but is primarily used for identifying people.",N4
合う,合う,,"To or for one another, Mutually, With","When following the conjunctive form of another verb, the う - Verb 合 う means to do that action in concert with another person/group. This is often translated as 'to mutually do (A)', or 'to do (A) for one another'. Realistically, it just means 'to do (A) reciprocally', with involvement from both sides being required. In this usage, 合 う is considered to be a suffix . This construction is often used with expressions like お 互 いに 'mutually', which simply emphasizes the point. Fun Fact While 合 う is regularly translated as 'to fit', or 'to meet' in English, its meaning is somewhat broader in Japanese. 合 う means to perform an action 'as one', where it is not possible (or would be difficult) to complete the action by oneself. Due to this, it is regularly used to describe ideal situations in which individuals should be doing something together, without thinking about their own personal gain. Caution 合 う may also be used to in regard to sports/contests. In these cases, it may seem like players are not doing the action 'for' each other, but involvement from both sides is required to make the act possible.",N3
同士,同士,,"Fellow, With each other, Mutually, Between, Among, Together, With","同士 'fellow' is a noun that may be used in the same way as a suffix . When used this way, it conveys things that are 'mutually (A)', 'fellow (A)', or '(A) together'. To use 同士 , attach it directly to the end of another noun, before expressing further information about that 'mutual' relationship. Alternatively, (noun + 同士 + の + noun) is also common, and expresses that noun (B) is a grouped form of noun (A). 同士 is used most often to express two different types of 'mutuality'. These are as follows: 種類 - Type. (A) is the same type as (B). 関係 - Relationship. (A) shares the same relationship as (B). Caution 同士 is most frequently used to highlight 'people', or 'living things' that share some type of relationship, rather than inanimate objects. An easy way to remember this is that the 士 kanji in this word means 'gentleman'. However, it may occasionally be seen in reference to inanimate objects as well.",N3
向き,向き,,"Suitable for, Facing","向 き is another noun in Japanese that is frequently used as a suffix . 向 き comes from the intransitive verb 向 く, meaning 'to face'. This word is often attached to the end of other nouns, in order to show that something is 'facing (A)', or 'suitable for (A)'. Due to 向 き being intransitive, it usually implies that something is facing toward (A) naturally, or through chance. Because of this, it may convey that something is 'suitable for (A)', but not necessarily designed specifically for it. Caution 向 け, coming from the transitive verb 向 ける is used far more often to express that something has been specifically designed for (A). When comparing 向 き and 向 け, the primary difference is that 向 き conveys that something is 'appropriate for (A)', while 向 け is closer to 'intended for (A)'.",N3
向け,向け,,"Intended for, Aimed at","向 け is a shortened form of the transitive verb 向 ける 'to aim at', and is considered to be a 造語 (neologism). This means a word that was created for a specific purpose, and may not necessarily be used for anything outside of that purpose. The purpose of 向 け is to attach to other nouns, in order to express that something is 'intended for (A)', 'aimed at (A)', or 'oriented toward (A)'. 向 け may be seen followed by the case marking particle に (when followed by a phrase), or the case marking particle の, when linked with another noun. In terms of products and similar items, although 向 け highlights that something has been intended for (A), it doesn't necessarily mean that it is limited to (A). Caution 向 け , coming from the transitive verb 向 ける is used far more often to express that something has been specifically designed for (A). On the other hand, the suffix stemming from the intransitive verb 向 く, ( 向 き ), expresses something that faces toward (A), but perhaps not intentionally.",N3
命令形,命令形,,"(Verb)!, Do (something)!","In Japanese, there are numerous ways to express an order, command, or instruction. The most direct, abrasive, and therefore least used method is called the imperative form , which happens to be one of the basic conjugations of verbs. Without particles following it, the imperative form is fairly uncommon in daily life, but will often be seen on traffic signs, posters, or banners. In addition, it can be also heard shouted at demonstrations, when cheering at sports events, or in urgent situations, such as an officer yelling at a suspect to stop. Verbs are conjugated into the imperative form in the following way. For う-Verbs, simply replace the last kana of any verb with the equivalent え sound kana from the same row. For る-Verbs, replace る with either ろ or よ. The imperative form may sometimes be softened with the particle よ . This is a pattern which is mostly used by men that are familiar with each other, in order to offer advice or encouragement. Women tend to use the more polite て-form of verbs instead. Any verb except for ある and いる may be conjugated to the imperative form, due to their meanings being based on existence and nothing more. Fun Fact The なさい , polite imperative that comes from なさる is mostly used by teachers and parents talking to their children. It is also often used in instructions on  test papers. When speaking to animals, the polite prefix お plus the ます-stem will also occasionally be used. Fun Fact Originally, よ was used instead of ろ with る-Verbs. Despite this, with time it has been gradually losing popularity, and nowadays it is considered to be a more formal, written variant.",N4
塗れ,塗れ,,"Stained, Covered in, Smeared, Dirty with, Soaked in","まみれ , seen primarily in hiragana only, is a grammar pattern that indicates being 'completely covered in (A)', 'smeared all over with (A)', or 'stained with (A)'. It will follow nouns, and may appear as まみれの when linked directly to a second noun that まみれ is modifying. In the vast majority of cases, まみれ will be used in regard to something that is negative, or can be perceived negatively even if it is not physical, like debt or desires. Examples of physically negative things include but are not limited to blood, mud, oil, etc. Fun Fact まみれ is the noun form of the る-Verb 塗 れる, coming from the same kanji and with a similar meaning as 塗 る, 'to paint'. Just like 'to paint', まみれる and まみれ primarily describe something covering the outer surface of another object, rather than its contents.",N1
如く,如く・如き・如し,,"Like, Similar to, As if, The same as","如 し is an classical auxiliary verb in Japanese which has a very similar meaning to its modern equivalent, よう 'manner of'. Just like よう, ごとし (written primarily in hiragana) focuses on the appearance of (A) based on observation. Due to this, ごとし may be translated as 'like (A)', 'similar to (A)', or 'as if it were (A)'. ごとし is the base form of this auxiliary verb , but ごとく (the conjunctive form ), and ごとき (the attributive form ) will also be seen. As only ごとき is attributive, it may be followed directly by other nouns, while ごとし most often comes at the end of sentences. ごとく acts as an adverb when preceding verbs, but may also be seen before breaks in clauses. Let's look at a few examples of each form. Like よう, ごとし and its variations will follow の when coming after a noun. However, it will follow が when coming after a verb. As ごとし is old-fashioned, it will primarily be encountered in books, rather than in speech. Fun Fact The kanji 如 itself has a meaning very similar to the word 'likeness' in English, indicating something that resembles (A) in every sense of the word, but is not actually (A). This kanji can be seen in several common words in Japanese such as 如何 'how'.",N1
如何,如何,,Depending on,"いかん is a grammar structure that has evolved as an abbreviation of 如何 に , an adverb meaning 'in what way'. In almost all circumstances, it can be translated directly as 'depending on', and will be followed by either the auxiliary verb だ at the end of sentences, or the conjunctive form of だ, で, when used in the middle of a sentence. いかん will follow nouns, and may or may not be preceded by の. Occasionally, いかん will be followed by によって. This may seem like repetition for no particular reason, but in most cases it will just strengthen the original meaning of 'depending on', and can be literally translated as 'depending on what way (A) is oriented, (B)'. いかん itself is used in a very similar way to 次第 'upon (A)', or 'depending on (A)', and more often than not implies that the degree of (A) will be the factor that determines the overall result. Due to this, it will often be followed by subclauses that use verbs of decision making such as 決 まる. Fun Fact いかん , like いかに, is simply another word that has the same meaning as どう 'how', and even shares the same kanji structure of 如何 , 如何 . It is also quite common to see the structure かどうであるによって 'depending on in what way' used as an explanation for the meaning of いかん in various dictionaries and other teaching resources. Due to this, it may be beneficial to simply consider いかん as a less common version of どう, or かどうである.",N1
始末だ,始末だ,,"Ends up, Finally, In the end, (Unfortunately) As a result, This is what happened, To come about, To wind up","始末 , a noun meaning ‘settlement’, or ‘end result’ is commonly used in order to indicate a negative sequence of events that has been passed through, causing an equally negative result to come about at the end. It will be translated as ‘to wind up as (A)’, ‘to end up as (A)’, or ‘to come about that (A)’. This expression will be used primarily after verbs in their dictionary form . Due to 始末 being used to highlight negative outcomes that are the result of going through a specific event, it will often appear in sentences that also include words like とうとう ‘to come to a head’, 挙 げ 句 ‘after a long process’, or 結局 ‘in the end’. It may seem redundant to include these phrases, but as 始末 has the more literal translation of ‘to culminate in’ (including everything from beginning to end), it is more emphatic, rather than redundant.",N1
左右する,左右する,,"Influence, Impact, Control","左右 is a noun that may literally be translated as 'left and right'. This particular noun is quite often used as a する verb, in order to convey the level of control someone has over a specific situation. This control may be translated as 'influence', 'impact', 'dictate' or simply 'control'. 左右 する may be used by itself, when describing a whole clause, or it may be followed directly by another noun, to show exactly what is being controlled/influenced. 左右 する is frequently seen in the passive form 左右 される. This is used most often when the noun following される is the thing that is being controlled itself, rather than こと or もの referring back to an earlier statement. Caution 左右 する implies direct (A)'s direct control of (B), and is far stronger than to affect ' 影響 '. Due to this, 左右 may be thought of as being closer to 'to dominate' in English. In Japanese though, the most basic description is 思 う ままに 動 かす 'to move exactly as one wishes'.",N3
幸いなことに,幸い・幸いなことに,,"Luckily, Fortunately","幸 いなことに , or simply 幸 い is a set phrase in Japanese for indicating that 'luckily (A)', or 'fortunately (A)'. This use directly reflects the meaning of the な-Adjective 幸 い as 'blessedness', or 'luck'. In most cases, 幸 いなことに will appear at the beginning of sentences, before going on to explain exactly what was 'lucky'. Fun-fact 幸 いなことに is just an extension of ことに. A combination of こと 'thing' and the particle に, which literally means something similar to 'to that which is (A)'. ことに is generally used to highlight some sort of strong (positive or negative) feeling in regard to the situation of (B).",N2
当たり~,当たり,,"Per~, A~, Apiece, Each","When attached to the end of numbers or counters, the noun 当 たり 'to hit' will be used as a suffix . In these cases, the meaning is usually translated as 'per (A)', or 'each (A)'. Let's take a look at some examples. Fun Fact While the literal meaning of 当 たり is 'to meet' (as in 'to come into physical contact with'), as a suffix , 当 たり has a nuance that is similar to に 対 して 'to be in relation to'. This similarity can be seen in the following: (A) 当 たり (B) - Regarding (A), (B) equates to it. (A) に 対 して (B) - Regarding (A), (B) equates to it.",N3
後の,後(の),,"…left, Rest, Remaining, In, …to, …else","One of the common uses for the noun 後 'behind' is to express a remainder, or everything after a certain point. This can be translated as 'what's left of (A)', 'the rest of (A)', 'what's remaining of (A)', or even 'other than (A)'. Let's have a look at a few examples. 後 will be grouped with the case marking particle の before nouns, come directly before numbers, or be used at the beginning of whole phrases. Despite having many different translations, the base meaning of 後 will always just be to identify a sequence of things, and what comes 'after' or 'behind' a specific point in that sequence.",N2
得ない,〜得ない,,"Unable to, Cannot","得 る is a る-Verb that has the meaning of 'to gain' or 'to acquire'. When attached to the conjunctive form of verbs, it takes on the nuance of 'for (A) to be possible', or 'able to (A)'. In addition to this, when 得 る is combined with ない, that nuance switches to 'unable to (A)', or 'cannot (A)'. Compared to できない, meaning that the potential to do something does not exist, 得 ない means something closer to 'there is no possibility that (A) can be done', or 'the possibility to do (A) has not been gained'. Caution 得 る may be seen as either える or うる. The primary difference between the two being that うる is a relatively old form that is often seen only in literature, and almost never spoken. Despite this, うる is never used in the negative form with ない. Fun-fact 得 る is far more formal/bookish than できる. However, there are several set phrases that are very common in daily speech that use this particular grammar point, such as あり 得 る 'possible', and あり 得 ない 'impossible'.",N2
得る,得る・得る,,"Is able to, Can, Possible","得 る is a る-Verb that has the meaning of 'to gain', or 'to acquire'. When attached to the conjunctive form of verbs, it takes on the nuance of 'for (A) to be possible', or 'to be able to (A)'. Compared to できる, meaning that the potential to do something exists. 得 る means something closer to 'there is a possibility that (A) can be done', or 'the possibility to do (A) has been gained'. Caution 得 る may be seen as either える or うる. The primary difference between the two being that うる is a relatively old form that is often seen in literature, and spoken far less frequently than える. Despite this, there is a tendency for うる to be the preferred spoken choice when the kana that appears before it is え, such as 教 える becoming 教 え うる , rather than 教 え える . Fun Fact 得 る is far more formal/bookish than できる. However, there are several set phrases that are very common in daily speech that use this particular grammar point, such as あり 得 る 'possible', and あり 得 ない 'impossible'.",N2
必ずしも,必ずしも,,"Not always, Not entirely, Not necessarily","Although it is often considered a stand-alone adverb , 必 ずしも is a combination of the adverb 必 ず 'invariably', or 'certainly', and the adverbial particles し and も. し and も are often combined in order to strengthen the meaning of the word before it. Due to this, 必 ずしも may be translated as something similar to 'absolutely certainly'. However, 必 ずしも is an expression that is only used in negative sentences, so is commonly translated as 'not always (A)', 'not entirely (A)', or 'not necessarily (A)'. Despite this, the literal meaning is close to 'not absolutely certainly (A)'. 必 ずしも is often used at the beginning of a phrase, before expressing something that is not 100% certain.",N3
思う様に,思うように,,"As one hopes, As desired, As one thought","思 うように is a common sentence pattern in Japanese that is used for illustrating when something either does or does not happen in the way that one had thought. This phrase may be interpreted as 'as one hopes', 'as desired', or 'as one thought'. 思 うように is simply a combination of the う-Verb 思 う and the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb ようだ, ように. Typical sentence structures that use this pattern will start with an (A) phrase highlighting the 'expectation', be followed by 思 うように , then finished with a (B) phrase indicating the outcome. When (B) is a simple noun, 様 な will be used instead. As the (B) part of 思 うように sentences will contain the information about whether the 'expectation' of (A) either was or was not met, this phrase may be used either positively or negatively to show that something did not meet, met, or even exceeded that expectation.",N2
恐れがある,恐れがある,,"There is a risk or fear that, Be in danger of, Possibility of","恐 れがある is a set phrase in Japanese that is used in a fairly literal sense to convey that 'there is a chance of (A)', or 'there is a fear of (A)'. This is a combination of the noun, 恐 れ 'fear', が, and the う-Verb ある 'to be'. 恐 れがある will be used when (A) is a negative outcome that may potentially occur in some particular situation, and is usually used to warn about being careful of something. 恐 れ is primarily used directly after verbs, or nouns followed by の. In most cases, 恐 れ carries the meaning of something that innately carries some kind of concern in relation to it, so depending on the context, alternative suitable translations could be 'concern', 'anxiety', 'worry', etc. Fun-fact In addition to がある following 恐 れ, other common combinations are 恐 れを 抱 く 'to carry the fear of (A)', or 'to bear the fear of (A)', and 恐 れが 強 まる 'for the fear of (A) to strengthen', or 'for the fear of (A) to intensify'.",N2
手前,手前,,"Before, In front of, From one's standpoint or side","The noun 手前 'in front of' has several different meanings in Japanese depending on whether it is being used with a verb in its standard form , or with a noun. Regarding verbs, it expresses 'going forward from (A), (B)'. This is usually in relation to something that has happened either accidentally or completely, and may represent what will be done as a result of being in that situation. This can also be interpreted as 'now that (A), (B)', and simply highlights that nothing can be done except to move on or 'forward' given the current circumstances. When 手前 appears with nouns followed by the case marking particle の, it often expresses that what is 'in front' of (A) is the reason for (B), or simply is 'in front of (B)'. Despite the many translations, 手前 always shows something that is 'facing' the noun or verb that appears with it. Due to this, thinking of this structure as similar to 'faced with (A), (B)' may be helpful, as English also expresses lack of option and finality in this way.",N2
折には,折には,,"When, Occasion, Opportunity, Time","When the noun 折 'fold' or 'pleat' is used adverbially with the case marking particle に, it indicates a time which may be used as an opportunity to do something. It is often translated as 'on the occasion of (A)', or 'when the chance of (A) comes up'. It is an expression that is primarily used as a formal, positive alternative for 時 に, but there are times that it may indicate something negative. 折 に may be seen after any structure that could connect to a noun, but will primarily appear after verbs in their standard forms , or nouns followed by の. Additionally, 折 に may occasionally appear as 折 には, but the additional は if often omitted. In most cases, 折 に will be used to indicate things that happen 'from time to time', rather than one off events. Caution 折 に appears in several common expressions that each have a slightly different meaning. 折 に 触 れて - On the occasion of (A), always (B). 折 があれば -  If there is the chance of (A), (B). 折 を 見 て - When the conditions are good for (A). 折 も 折 - At the exact moment of (A).",N1
抜きで,抜きで,,"Without, Unless","抜 きで , a combination of the noun form of the う-Verb 抜 く 'to extract', and the particle で, is a construction that usually indicates something being done 'without (A)', or 'with the removal of (A)'. As ぬき indicates the extraction of something, this grammar pattern is primarily used to indicate 'leaving out', or 'setting aside' something that is regularly included. 抜 きで acts as a suffix , so will be utilized after nouns, to indicate the thing that is being left out. Both the plain hiragana and kanji forms are fairly common. Additionally, の will replace で when ぬき is followed directly by another noun. Occasionally, にして may also replace で, but this is structure is more common when the part (B) section of the sentence includes a ない or できない based statement. These expressions indicate that something 'will not happen without (A)', or 'is not possible without (A)'. However; this is not always the case, as ぬきで or ぬきでは may also appear in negative sentences, with the same meaning.",N2
抜く~,抜く,,"All~, Completely, See through, Overcome, To the bitter end","When connected to the ます-stem of another verb, the う-Verb 抜 く 'to extract' is often used to indicate that (A) has happened 'completely'. This 'extract' nuance frequently indicates that beyond completion, (A) has been 'overcome', or 'seen through to the bitter end'. The literal meaning of 抜 く can be thought of as being quite close to the English expression 'to pull through', for example, 'despite difficulties, I pulled through in the end'. Let's look at a few examples of where 抜 く will be used. Alternatively, 抜 く may be used in situations where (A) is something that is done to a very deep or substantial degree. This nuance is less like 'to pull through', and closer to 'thoroughly', or simply 'deeply'. This meaning tends to appear with verbs that don't have an obvious end, like 知 る 'to know'. Despite this nuance seeming different, the verb with 抜 く attached to it in these types of sentences is usually considered to have already been done to a 'finished' degree, where there is nothing left beyond that point. With the example of 'to know', it would mean 'to know every single little detail'. Caution - On most occasions, ぬく will be used when there is some hardship or adversity associated with the action. Also, unlike きる , ぬく will almost always be used in relation to human actions. きる on the other hand may be used in relation to either human actions or other events equally as naturally.",N2
最中に,最中に,,In the middle of,"While 中 に highlights that something is in the process of happening (when used in relation to events/actions), 最中 に strengthens that meaning further, to show that something is 'right in the middle of happening'. As the kanji 最 means 'utmost', we can see that the literal meaning is 'utmost middle'. This can be translated in a similar way to phrases like 'at the height of (A)', or 'in the midst of (A)', in English. When using 最中 に , a (B) part of the sentence will usually highlight something else that happened during (A), somehow interrupting or disturbing it. To use 最中 に , attach it to the end of the ている form of a verb, or a noun followed by の. Caution 最中 may also occasionally be used with adjectives, but this is uncommon. In these cases, the meaning is to be at the 'pinnacle' of whatever the adjective is describing (usually a feeling/emotion).",N3
未だに,未だに,,"Still, Not yet, Even now","Although stemming from the same kanji, まだ 'still' will almost always be read as 未 だ 'still' when appearing in its kanji form. When combined with に, like まだ, 未 だ will indicate that something is 'still (A)', or 'not yet (A)', depending on whether the verb it is paired with is negated or not. As 未 だに will be used adverbially, it will mostly appear at the beginning of sentences. Compared to まだ , 未 だに is more formal, and will often imply that something has been continuing for a much longer period of time. This is similar to adding the word ずっと to a standard sentence.",N2
極まりない,極まりない・極まる,,"Extreme, Extremely","Seen as either 極 まりない or 極 まる , this grammar structure makes use of the core meaning of the う-Verb 極 まる 'to be at the extremity of (A)', and will most often be translated simply as 'extremely (A)'. In most cases, this grammar pattern will appear following words that indicate some kind of negative state or emotion. 極 まる will be used immediately following な-Adjectives, while 極 まりない will come after こと when either a な-Adejctive or い-Adjective precedes it. In the case of な-Adjectives, it is not a requirement that 極まりない be preceded by なこと, and it is actually more common for it to directly follow the な-Adjective without な. Caution 極 まりない is not the negative form of 極 まる , but the noun 極 まり 'the extremity' followed directly by the い-Adjective ない, with が omitted between them. This means that the more literal translation for the difference between the two would be something like the following. 失礼 極 まりない - There is no limit to the rudeness of (A). 失礼 極 まる - The rudeness of (A) goes to the limit. As can be seen, while the meanings are opposite in some sense, the actual nuance of (A) being 'extremely' something remains the same. The actual negative form of 極 まる would be 極 まらない , and would mean that something does 'not go to the limit of (A)'.",N1
次第だ,次第だ・次第で,,"Depending on, So","Coming after another noun, 次第 'directly following' is a noun that will often be used in a similar way to a suffix . In these cases, it will be followed by だ, or で and a part (B) statement. In this use, 次第 will be translated as 'depending on (A), (B)', or '(B) depends on (A)'. (A) will most frequently highlight a person or some specific situation that is considered to be in control of what happens next. Fun-fact In all of its nuances, 次第 just expresses a sequence of events or deciding factors, and what either will or has happened due to that. This link can be seen in other grammar patterns like 次第 'as soon as' , and 次第 です 'due to that', or 'as a result of that'.",N2
次第です,次第です,,"Because the reason is, Therefore, The present situation is like this, This is how (it is), Those are the circumstances, This is why","When following a verb in one of its standard form s, 次第 'directly following' will be used to express reasons or give explanations. In these cases, it will be followed by either of the auxiliary verbs だ, or です. However, です is far more common, due to this use of 次第 primarily appearing in polite speech . In this particular use of 次第 , it is similar to 'the eventuation is that (A)', meaning that something ultimately ended up as (A). Fun Fact In all of its nuances, 次第 just expresses a sequence of events or deciding factors, and what either will or has happened due to that. This link can be seen in other grammar patterns like 次第 'as soon as' , and 次第 だ 'depending on', or 'so'.",N1
次第,次第,,As soon as,"次第 is a noun that is often translated in different ways, depending on what type of word it follows. In this lesson, we will look at the meaning associated with the conjunctive form of standard verbs, and the stem of する verbs. Although it is a noun, 次第 may also be classified simply as a suffix in many cases. Basically, 次第 means 'next in sequence after (A)', and is often translated to 'as soon as (A)'. Fun Fact One of the most important things to keep in mind with 次第 , is that the literal meaning in almost every situation is 'determining sequence'. This is unlike any standard phrase in English, but simply expresses that (A) is what will govern (B). Let's look at how this translates with different word types. Verb 次第 - Verb determines the sequence of (B). Since a verb is not capable of making a choice, (A) simply 'happening' will result in (B). Living noun 次第 - Noun determines the sequence of (B). Since living things can make choices, (B) will depend on (A). Inanimate/abstract noun 次第 - Noun determines the sequence of (B). Since inanimate/abstract things cannot make choices, (A) will determine (B)'s course of action. (B) will usually involve some kind of decision.",N3
気,気,,"Feel like ~, Spirit","When used after verbs, 気 often indicates either the will or desire to do that particular action. This use of 気 is often interpreted as 'to feel like doing (A)' in English. More literally, 気 may be translated as 'mind', as is similar to the way phrases like 'to have half a mind to (A)' in English, indicating that something is either positively or negatively drawing the speaker's attention toward doing (or avoiding) the action of (A). As 気 itself is a noun expressing the 'mind' or 'intention' to do (A), it may be followed by a variety of different verbs indicating an array of slightly unique nuances. Common patterns are 気 がある 'to have the feeling of (A)', 気 がない 'to not have the feeling of (A)', 気 がする 'to feel like (A)', 気 がしない 'to not feel like (A)', 気 が 出 る 'for the feeling of (A) to come about', and 気 が 出 ない 'for the feeling of (A) to not come about'.",N2
決して〜ない,決して〜ない,,"Never, By no means","決 して by itself is the て form of the verb 決 する 'to determine'. However 決 して is special in that it is considered to be a stand-alone adverb . As an adverb, it carries the meaning of 'decidedly', or 'assuredly', and is used in sentences that contain ない, in order to convey 'never (A)', 'under no circumstances (A)' or 'by no means (A)'. Like many other adverbs in Japanese, 決 して can appear at the beginning of a sentence, or directly before the word it is modifying (which will be in its ない form). While the translation is 'never', the literal meaning of 決 して is 'decidedly not (A)', or 'assuredly not (A)', simply emphasizing the negative point within a sentence. Caution 決 して may also sometimes be paired with other structures that are not specifically negative, the primary example of this being ものか (a grammar point that we will learn about later). ものか strongly confirms a statement as being something that does not exist/will not be done.",N3
活かす,活かす,,"To make use of (something), To take full advantage of, To capitalize on, To leverage (skills), Bring out (the quality of)","When を 活 かす is partnered with a noun, it shows that (A) is something that is being made good use of, or leveraged. This can be in relation to skills, experiences, attributes, and many other things. This grammar point may appear either in the form of the う-Verb 活 かす 'to enliven' or 生 かす 'to keep alive', with very little change in nuance. However, 活 かす tends to appear far more frequently, as the focus of this kanji is less in relation to the preservation of life, and more on just 'making good use' of something. When linked to a (B) noun, in order to show that something 'has' been made good use of, 活 かす will appear in the past tense. Fun-fact 活 かす will often be used with adverbs of amount or quality, in order to highlight just how well (A) is being made good use of, or capitalized on. Examples include 十分 に 'adaquately', 有効 に 'effectively', 最大限 に 'to the fullest', and similar words.",N2
点,点,,"Aspect, Respect, Point, Way, In terms of, In that, From the point of view","点 is a kanji that is regularly used to express a specific 'point', 'spot', 'aspect', or something similar. When attached to the end of the attributive form of another word, it will highlight that word as a point of interest within the sentence. This is regularly translated as 'from the aspect of (A)', 'in respect to (A)', 'in terms of (A)', and other similar phrases that simply draw attention to something. To use 点 , attach it to the attributive form of another word, a noun followed by の, or a phrase followed by という. In many cases, 点 will be followed by the case marking particle で, but other particles may be used depending whether 点 is being conveyed as a subject, object, destination, or something being utilized. Sometimes, で (as 'with' or 'at') may be replaced with expressions such as について 'in relation to (A)', or からいうと 'speaking from (A)'. So long as the grammar structure that accompanies 点 is also used to highlight something specific (and can be paired with a noun), it will sound natural.",N3
甲斐がある,甲斐がある,,"To be (not) worth, To (not) pay off","甲斐 , a noun meaning 'worth' or 'effect', will often be used following verbs or nouns, in order to show that (A) was or will be worth doing. In many cases, this grammar point will be seen in hiragana, and will appear as either かい or がい, depending on how it is conjugating with the previous word. Possible translations include things like 'it is worth doing (A)', or '(A) will pay off'. が and the う-Verb ある 'to be' will follow かい. This states that the 'worth of (A) exists'. Occasionally, the が will be omitted. When following verbs, がい will be used after the ます-stem, or かい may be used after any standard form. The primary difference between these conjugation patterns is that there is more focus on the tense of the verb with かい, whereas がい will frequently have the nuance of it 'always being worth (A)'. When pairing with nouns, の will be required before かいがある. Alternatively, かいがない may be used in order to indicate that it is 'not' worth doing something. かいがある is primarily used when the speaker wants to convey that a positive result will come from something that is either difficult or unpleasant.",N2
的~,的,,"~ly・~like・~al, Typical","的 is a 接語尾 (suffix) in Japanese that has two primary uses. The first use is very similar to 'as' or 'for' in English, and means 'considering/within the category of (A), (B)'. The second use primarily relates to people, and will be covered later. As a single word, 的 is often likened to adjective endings such as '~ly', '~like', and '~al'. To use 的 , attach it to the end of a noun that you want to express as being the focus point of either a verb or a noun that will come later in the sentence. When describing a noun, 的 will be followed by な (meaning that it becomes a な-Adjective ). When describing a verb, it will be followed by に (making it an adverb). Fun Fact The second common use of 的 is specifically with the names of people, and highlights that (B) is something that is being considered in regard to (A). (A) being the person mentioned. This may be used either positively or negatively. In English, this is similar to 'that's so (A)', or 'just what you'd expect of (A)'. Fun Fact The easiest way to understand and use 的 correctly almost all the time, is by knowing another common suffix , 圏 . Let's look at how these suffixes compare: 圏 - Occurring in the sphere of (A), (B). (B) only happens inside of (A). 的 - Speaking in the sphere of (A), (B). (B) can only be said within the sphere of (A). As we can see here, when you want to convey something that can be said from a specific standpoint, 的 will be a logical choice.",N3
~,的,,"~ly・~like・~al, Typical","的 is a 接語尾 (suffix) in Japanese that has two primary uses.

直ちに,直ちに,,"At once, Immediately, As soon as","The adverb 直 ちに is commonly used in Japanese to convey that something is happening 'immediately', or 'at once'. Like many adverbs, it will regularly appear at the beginning of a sentence. Fun Fact Coming from the kanji 直 , meaning 'direct', 直 ちに often carries the nuance that something is done 'directly' (and purposely). This is usually after something happens, or after something is completed. To indicate things that happen immediately, but not intentionally, 忽 ち may be used.",N3
相まって,相まって,,"Combined with, Coupled with, Together with","相 まって is a structure used for showing that (A) and (B) are things that will perform some sort of synergistic task in order to achieve the result of (C). In many cases, either (A) or (B) alone could achieve (C), but their combined action will bring about a better result. This structure is a combination of 相 , 'mutual', or 'reciprocal', and the て-form of the う-Verb 俟 つ 'to wait on'. In this pattern, both (A) and (B) will often come before 相 まって , with either of the case-marking particles と or が being used after the nouns. Common translations include '(A) combined with (B) will (C)', or 'coupled together with (A), (B) will (C)'. As for a literal translation, 'mutually depending on each other, (C)' is fairly close to the exact nuance. See the fun-fact for more about this. Fun Fact Although 俟 つ 'to wait on' and 待 つ 'to wait for' are very similar, they have a primary difference in their focus. 待 つ indicates waiting in the sense of 'waiting for (A) to come', while 俟 つ indicates 'waiting for (A) to go'. What this means is that with 相 まって and other uses of 俟 つ, the important thing happens after (A) and (B) come together. This gives the nuance of (A) and (B) having some kind of reliance on each other in order to do (C). Due to 俟 つ being far less common in modern Japanese, it will often be written in hiragana.",N1
真っ,真(っ),,"Completely, Exactly, Right","The prefix ま, coming from the kanji 真 (true), is attached to words in Japanese to express that something is 'completely', 'exactly', 'genuinely' (A). Depending on the word that follows 真 , several different conjugation patterns will be used. This conjugation depends on which column the first kana of the word after 真 comes from. ま comes from the ま, み, む, め, も column, for example. When linked with a ま column, or な column word, 真 will become 真 ん. When linked with a か column, さ column, or しゃ sound word, 真 will become 真 っ. When linked with a は column, 真 will become 真 っ, and the first kana of the following word will change to a 'P' sound. Caution There are several exceptions to the standard changes that happen when using 真 as a prefix . These are as follows. When linked with 青 い, 真 will become 真 っ, and 青 い will become 青 . When linked with 赤 い, 真 will become 真 っ, and 赤 い will become 赤 .",N4
確かに,確かに,,"Surely, Certainly","確 かに is the adverbial use of the な-Adjective 確 か, meaning 'to be certain', or 'to be assured'. It may be used in the same way as 'certainly' or 'surely' in English, especially when the speaker wants to highlight (A) is definitely the case. Caution 確 かに as 'certainly' is only used for verifying information, and does not carry the nuance of giving permission, as it does in English. Caution When the に is removed, 確 か is often used in a similar way to 'if I remember correctly', 'if I'm not mistaken', or 'now that you mention it'.",N2
第一,第一,,"Start, First (point), Foremost, To begin with","第一 is an expression in Japanese which may be used either as an adverb , or as a noun . As a noun, it will carry the meaning of 'foremost', or 'most important'. As an adverb, it can mean 'first', or 'above anything'. To use 第一 adverbially, pair it with に . As a noun, it will usually be followed by の (when connecting nouns), or by the auxiliary verb だ , when at the end of a sentence. に will often be ommited when there is no need to put specific emphasis on a time. Occasionally, まず 'first of all' will be paired with 第一 . This may seem redundant, but is like saying 'the very first' in English. Fun Fact 第 is a kanji that is often translated as 'number'. However, the literal meaning is a bit closer to 'position', as it refers to the place that something has within a sequence of numbers. As such, 第一 simply means '1st position'.",N3
精々(),精々,,"(At) most , (At) best, No more than, Barely","精々 'at the limit' is an adverb used to convey that something is 'at the most (A)', or 'at best (A)'. This just indicates that the point that (A) has reached cannot be progressed beyond, due to having already reached some physical or metaphorical barrier. This can also often come across as 'no more than (A)', especially in cases where no actual barrier exists, but the speaker cannot imagine that anything higher (or lower) than (A) is possible. As 精々 is an adverb, it often appears at the beginning of sentence, or at the beginning of the second clause of a sentence, before the thing that is thought to be at its maximum is described. Fun-fact 精々 is said to have come from the old-fashioned word 精試 , which meant 'to completely exhaust all of one's good faith'. In modern times, 精々 itself has kept this meaning of 'completely exhausting (A)'. However, this is no longer used in reference to 'good faith', but rather exhausting all of one's 'power', 'mental capacity', or 'power of assumption' in relation to (A).",N2
結果,結果・の結果,,As a result of,"結果 'result' is a noun in Japanese that is often seen paired with the past form of verbs, or with nouns followed by の. This grammar structure can be translated as 'as a result of (A), (B)', and simply indicates (A) as being the cause for how something ended up. Caution Unlike あげく , a similar grammar point that is used for highlighting causes, 結果 may highlight both positive and negative results, while あげく tends to only be used when the outcome is negative.",N2
考えられない,考えられない,,"Unthinkable, Inconceivable, Unimaginable, Cannot think","考 えられない is the negative potential form of the る - Verb 考 える 'to consider'. It will regularly be used after the adverbial particle など ( なんか , or なんて ), or any expression that nominalizes a phrase, like ということは. 考 えられない is regularly translated as '(A) is unimaginable', or '(A) is unthinkable', which is quite close to the literal meaning. Caution While 考 えられない refers to the inability to think of a certain thing, 考 えない 'to not consider', or 考 えていない 'to not be considering' express something that the speaker has control over. Due to this, only 考 えられない may be used when implying something that is unbelievable.",N3
聞こえる,聞こえる,,"To be audible, To sound (like), (Can) hear, To be heard","聞 こえる is a verb that is often used to describe things that can be heard, or the way in which something is heard. Because of this, the most common translations of this verb are 'to be audible', or 'to sound like (A)'. 聞 こえる is an intransitive verb, and literally means 'to give off sound'. When using 聞 こえる , (A) will always be followed by が . (A) is considered to be the 'source' of the sound (a noun). However, the 'way that something sounds' will be marked adverbially. This means that an い-Adjective will be changed to its く form, and な-Adjectives /nouns will be followed by に . Fun Fact The primary difference between 聞 こえる , and 聞 ける (the potential form of 聞 く), is that 聞 こえる is used to identify things that do not require the active concentration of the listener to be heard. In other words, ambient noise. However, 聞 ける is used when the speaker is trying to concentrate on some specific sound, and refers to their 'ability' to hear it.",N4
要するに,要するに,,"To sum up, In summary, In short","要 するに is an expression in Japanese used to highlight important information in a similar way to 'to sum up', 'in summary', or 'in short' in English. It is a combination of the する-Verb 要 'to need', or 'to require', and に. Literally it means something similar to 'as for what's necessary (A)'. This is a phrase that will only ever take the initial position in a sentence, before expressing a condensed version of what has previously been said.",N2
見える,見える,,"To be visible, To seem, To be in sight","In the same way that 聞 こえる is used to describe things that are 'audible', 見 える can be used to describe things that are 'visible'. 見 える itself is an intransitive verb, meaning that the object that is 'visible' will be marked with が . When using 見 える , (A) will always be followed by が . However, the 'way that something looks' will be marked adverbially. This means that an い-Adjective will be changed to its く form, and な-Adjectives /nouns will be followed by に . This usage of 見 える will be covered more in our focused lesson on this particular grammar structure. Fun Fact The primary difference between 見 える , and 見 られる (the potential form of 見 る), is that 見 える is used to identify things that do not require the active concentration of the spectator to be seen. In other words, seeing it is unavoidable (if looking in its direction of course). However, 見 られる is used when the onlooker, is trying to concentrate on some specific object, and is referring to their 'ability' to see it. Fun Fact 見 える is also sometimes used to describe the 'sense' of sight, and refers to whether anything is visible at all for the speaker.",N4
言うまでもない,言うまでもない,,"It goes without saying, It is needless to say, Of course, Obviously","Unlike は 言 うまでもない, which usually comes after other phrases, 言 うまでもない tends to come at the beginning. It is a structure that combines the う - Verb 言 う, two (2) adverbial particles まで and も, and the い-Adjective ない. This is regularly translated as 'it goes without saying that (A)', or 'it is needless to say (A)', where (A) is whatever comes later in the sentence. 言 うまでもない is often followed directly by ことだが, が, けど, and similar expressions, to add the nuance of 'but'. Fun Fact 言 うまでもない is a polite way to express that something is 'obvious', without unintentionally sounding arrogant.",N3
誰か,誰か・どこか・誰も・どこも,pn,"Someone, Somewhere, Not anyone, Not anywhere","The constructions 誰 か , and どこか are used when you want to ask, or answer questions about 'someone', or 'somewhere' (positive sentences). Alternatively, 'no one', or 'nowhere' based statements are made with 誰 も , and どこも (negative sentences). Structures like this that use 誰 were briefly discussed in the 誰 grammar point. Using 誰 , or どこ is not limited to the か and も particles. へ , に , or と may also be partnered with か or も , to give a more specific meaning. As can be seen with these examples, か will always precede any other particle in a positive sentence. However, the opposite is true for も . も will always follow any other particles in negative sentences. This is because か will always attach directly to the noun (when altering the meaning of that noun), but も alters the whole phrase, not just the noun. However, It should be noted that も is not limited to appearing in negative sentences, as can be seen with the final example.",N5
込む,込む,,"To go into, To put into","In Japanese, the う - Verb 込 む 'to jam into' is frequently used as a suffix to convey several different meanings. The primary meanings are as follows: (A) 込 む - To enter completely into doing (A), or the state of being in (A). (A) 込 む - To enter a state of doing (A) that will not be considered complete until 'success'. (A) 込 む - To enter a state of doing (A) that cannot be escaped from. In this lesson, we will exclusively focus on the first meaning, which is usually translated as 'to put into (A)', or 'to go into (A)'. This form will be attached to the conjunctive form of other verbs. Despite the multiple meanings, 込 む can almost always be thought of as 'jamming (B) into (A)'. This means that whatever the (A) action is, will be something that is not easily entered, but also not easily escaped from.",N3
込む,込む,,"Remain, To do thoroughly, Deeply, Intensely","In Japanese, the う - Verb 込 む 'to jam into' is frequently used as a suffix to convey several different meanings. The primary meanings are as follows: (A) 込 む - To enter completely into doing (A), or the state of being in (A). (A) 込 む - To enter a state of doing (A) that will not be considered complete until 'success'. (A) 込 む - To enter a state of doing (A) that cannot be escaped from. In this lesson, we will exclusively focus on the second and third meanings, which are usually translated as 'to remain in (A)', 'to thoroughly do (A)', 'to do (A) deeply', or 'to do (A) intensely'. This form will be attached to the conjunctive form of other verbs. Despite the multiple meanings, 込 む can almost always be thought of as 'jamming (B) into (A)'. This means that whatever the (A) action is, will be something that is not easily entered, but also not easily escaped from.",N3
逆に,逆に,,On the contrary,"逆 に is a grammar pattern that indicates that something is 'contrary' to what has previously been said. This is a structure made up of the noun 逆 'reverse', 'opposite', or 'converse', and に. Due to the inclusion of に, this phrase behaves adverbially, and will usually appear between two phrases, to indicate that 'on the contrary to (A), (B)', or 'conversely to (A), (B)'. In modern Japanese, 逆 に is also frequently used at the beginning of a sentence, simply to indicate a rebuttal toward something that someone has just said, or as a slang version of 別 に when asked questions about preferences, or similar things.",N2
途中に,途中に・途中で,,"On the way, Partway, In the middle of","With 途中 meaning 'on the way', the addition of either the case marking particle に or で will indicate that something is either being done 'on the way to (A)', 'partway through (A)' or 'in the middle of (A)'. 途中 may be seen after verbs in their standard form, or nouns followed by の. As always, に will put more emphasis on the time or duration of (A), while で will put further emphasis on the process of (A) being the cause of (B), or being used as an opportunity to do (B). Let's take a look at both. The meanings of で and に in regard to this particular grammar point can overlap quite often, so it may be necessary to see many examples before the slight difference in nuance becomes apparent.",N2
連用形,連用形,,Formal Conjunctive,"In Japanese, the conjunctive form is often called 'the ます form', or 'the conjunctive form'. 'The conjunctive form' is much more accurate, as it is used with more than just verbs. Basically, the conjunctive form is the form of any word that will be used in standard conjugation with other structures. For い-Adjectives , this is the form that uses く, for verbs, the ます stem. The reason that conjunctive form is sometimes referred to as 'the formal conjunctive' is due to its use before a comma. Usually, the conjunction particle て would be used to separate clauses in sentences, however, the formal conjunctive allows this to be done without て. Let's look at some examples. As we can see, although て is not required, a 読点 (Japanese comma) will be required to prevent the sentence from becoming confusing. Caution This type of conjugation is seen primarily in formal writing, and the standard て form will be heard much more frequently in daily speech.",N3
遂に,遂に,,"Finally, At last","Like とうとう , 遂 に is an adverb that is frequently used to mean 'finally', or 'at last'. It will usually come at the beginning of a sentence. 遂 に may be seen equally as often with or without kanji. When compared to 到頭 , ついに is slightly more formal. Caution The kanji 遂 has a meaning similar to 'to get (something) over with'. Due to this, ついに will most often be used to highlight things that have finally happened after a significant period of time, or a long course of events. It will not be used to express things that do not require time or effort.",N3
関係がある(),関係がある,,"(Not) involved with, (Not) concerned with, (No) connection with, (No) relationship with, (Not) related to","When the noun 関係 'a relation' is paired with がある 'to have', it will be received in a similar way to phrases like 'involved with (A)', 'concerning (A)', or 'in relation to (A)'. 関係 がある is often be preceded by the case marking particle に , expressing the location 'where' the connection exists. に itself will always be preceded by a noun or noun-phrase. Alternatively, に can be replaced by other case marking particle such as と or の. Each has a slightly different nuance, but are used quite interchangeably. に 関係 がある - Relating to (A). と 関係 がある - Related with (A). の 関係 がある - Having a relation with (A). Naturally, ある may be replaced by ない, to express that the is 'no relation' between (A) and (B). Fun Fact The primary difference between に and と in this grammar pattern is that に highlights the relationship from a single perspective, while と focuses more on how (A) and (B) are related together.",N3
限り,限り,,"As long as, While… is the case, Limited to","Although several grammar patterns make use of the う-Verb 限 る 'to limit', 限 り may be the most versatile. This is partly because it does not include に like other 限 る based structures, and therefore will have its meaning modified by the word that comes directly before it. 限 り will follow verbs in their standard forms, and nouns linked to である. Let's take a look at a few of the standard meanings and translations. The first meaning indicates that (B) is something that is limited to being within the scope of (A). This is the most standard meaning and can be translated as 'limited to (A), (B)'. The second meaning highlights that within the limit or scope of some particular source of information, (B) is true. This scope usually relates to the senses (like vision), or to knowledge. This may be interpreted as 'as far as (A), (B)', 'as long as (A), (B)'. The third and final meaning of 限 り will imply that 'limited to (A) being the case, (B) will occur'. In this nuance, 限 り simply implies that assuming that (A) is true, (B) is something that will need to be taken into account as well. This will be interpreted as 'while (A) is the case, (B)', or 'assuming (A), (B)'. Despite these various meanings, 限 る will always highlight (A) as the limit or constraint within which the logic of (B) exists.",N2
陸に～ない,陸に～ない,,"Not well or properly, Not much or enough, Barely, Hardly","When the adverb 陸 に 'satisfactorily' appears in ない sentences, it indicates that (A) is 'not satisfactory', 'not enough', or 'not being done properly'. This grammar pattern appears at the beginning of phrases, before the (B) part of the sentence will include a ない word, often a verb in its potential form. While ろくに will often appear in the kanji form, it is also common to see this structure in hiragana alone. Alternatively, 碌 に may also sometimes be seen, but this particular kanji is ateji (a kanji used purely for its pronunciation, not its meaning). This particular grammar point often has the nuance of something that is being done without sufficient effort, or is half-baked. Fun-fact 陸 comes from the kanji meaning 'land', and is used with the reading of ろく when the nuance is flatness, correctness, or seriousness.",N2
際に,際に,,"When, At the time of, In case of, On the occasion of","際 is a noun in Japanese that means 'verge'. This is as in 'to be on the verge', and translates mostly as 'on the occasion of (A)', 'at the time of (A)', 'in case of (A)', or 'when (A)'. In the same way as 'verge' in English, it implies a fairly big or somehow important event, and will not be used with standard occurrences. 際 に will appear after verbs in either their dictionary or past-tense forms, and after nouns. In the case of nouns, it will be preceded by の. While (A) is likely to be a temporary or one-off event, 際 に is not limited to one-off situations. It may also appear with regularly occurring events, but the way of reacting to that event may change depending on some one-off circumstances. Caution Although 際 に and 時 に may overlap in certain situations, 際 に will sound unnatural when the situation involves something that typically does not change, or always happens the same way.",N2
風,風,,"-style, Way, Fashion","風 is a suffix that is used in Japanese to convey the meaning of 'in the style of (A)', or 'in the fashion of (A)'. Literally, this translates to 'in the wind of (A)', which is just the Japanese way of expressing the former statements. To use 風 , attach it to the end of a noun that you want to label something as being in the 'style' of. の may also be attached to the end of 風 , before connecting it to another noun. This will show that '(B) is in the style of (A)'. Caution As a compound structure, this suffix is always pronounced ふう , never かぜ (the standard reading of 風 ).",N4
飽くまで,飽くまで(も),,"Just, Only, Merely, Strictly","飽 く is the old-fashioned and somewhat poetic version of 飽 きる the る-Verb meaning 'to tire of (A)', or 'to get sick of (A)'. When used in conjunction with the adverbial particles まで 'until', 飽 くまで can imply that (A) is 'just', 'only', or 'strictly' something. The more literal translation of 'to continue (A) to the point of getting tired of it' fits these interpretations quite well, implying that (A) will never deviate from what is being described about it. This use of 飽 くまで often appears at the beginning of a phrase, and functions adverbially. The adverbial particle も 'even' may be added for extra emphasis, but it is not required. In many cases, 飽 くまで will be used in polite sentences when the speaker is expressing their own opinion. In these cases, the nuance of 'this is merely my opinion' is conveying to the listener that the speaker realizes that what they are saying is not the only viewpoint. This way of highlighting opinions is often combined with structures like けど, or が when the speaker wants to soften their statement before offering what they think a solution might be.",N1
１～たりとも～ない,１～たりとも～ない,,"Not even one, Not a single, No (at all)","たりとも is a grammar pattern that is most often used in negative sentences, in order to indicate that (A) is not an exception to something. It will follow either number words, or nouns. Possible translations include 'not even one (A)', and 'not a single (A)'. However, due to たりとも just being a combination of the auxiliary verb たり 'presenting examples', and the conjunction particle とも 'presenting approximate limitations', the literal translation of たりとも is just 'even limited to (A) as an example, not (B)', with the 'not (B)' coming from the negative structure in the second half of the sentence. This is a very formal expression, so will not be used in daily conversation. Fun Fact 何人 たりとも 'no matter who it is, no exceptions' is a set expression that may see more frequent use than any of the other たりとも structures.",N1
～所に,～ところに・～ところへ,,"At the time, When, While, Timing","ところに will be used to highlight the time of (A), and can be interpreted as 'at the time of (A)', 'while (A)', or 'with the timing of (A)'. As it is a structure that makes use of the noun ところ 'place' or 'spot', it puts more emphasis on the scene or situation, rather than the action itself. This pattern follows verbs in their ている or ていた forms. Also, rather than appearing with に, へ is sometimes used instead. Depending on the form of the verb, ところに may indicate being 'on the verge of (A)', 'partway through (A)', or having 'just finished (A)'. Compared to other ところ based structures, the addition of に or へ will often precede a (B) statement indicating that 'at the precise moment of (A), (B) happened'. This may either be positive or negative. Caution In many cases, ところに will be used when (A) is either a 'situation' or an 'emotion', and will not often be used in relation to unimportant or trivial actions, unless expressing the 'precise moment' where something unexpected happened during that trivial action. Caution When appearing with nouns, な-Adjectives, or い-Adjectives, ところに , へ, で, and を simply highlight that 'state of (A)'.",N2
～るまでだ,～るまでだ,,"Just, Merely, Simply, Only","までだ, and までのことだ are structures that are usually translated as 'merely (B)', or 'simply (B)'. However, they are almost always used in somewhat hypothetical sentences, and translate much closer to 'one can only but (B)'. This nuance indicates a sense of resignation, or understanding on the part of the speaker that they personally have no options beyond (B). This grammar pattern will be used following verbs in their dictionary form , and will often come at the end of a sentence that uses なら in the first clause. In this way, it will mean 'if (A), then (B) is all that can be done'. (A) will almost always be a negative situation. Examining the standard meaning of the particle まで as signifying an extent, it can be seen that this meaning is kept in までだ, with the speaker expressing that (B) is the extent of what is possible given the negative circumstances brought about by (A).",N1
～てこそ,～てこそ,,"Only if, Because, By, Unless, Until","In a similar way to how the particle こそ highlights a particular word as being the 'precise' or 'exact' reason for something, its combination with the て-form of a verb will indicate that (B) is absolutely reliant on (A). This reliance can be translated in several different ways, and will usually become clear in the (B) part of sentences. Standard interpretations include 'only if (A), (B)', 'unless (A), (B)', or 'until (A), (B)'. The reliance that (B) has on (A) can be translated in several different ways, but the most common interpretations are that (A) will determine either the outcome, assessment, or evaluation of (B), based on the speaker's opinion, values, or understanding of the situation.",N2
～なり～なり,～なり～なり,,"Or, Either or","When the classical adverbial particle なり is used in lists, it expresses that each item within that list is a possibility, but that one particular thing will be or needs to be chosen. This use of なり will indicate that either (A) or (B) is fine, but anything else that falls within that same category is probably fine too. Due to this, it is non-exhaustive. なり is a fairly polite construction and will appear after either verbs in their dictionary forms , or nouns that may or may not be followed by another particle. This is in cases where that particle is giving important information involved in the 'choice'. An example of this would be に for marking a location. As with all adverbial particles , なり cannot follow either が or を. Caution This emphasis on (A) なり (B) なり presenting lists from which something will be chosen is what differentiates it from similar structures such as など and や. Due to this, なり will not be used to mean 'such as', but only for 'either, or' statements.",N1
～に〜ない,〜に〜ない,,"Cannot even...if wants, Would like to...but cannot, Wants to...but cannot","に～ない is a construction which appears with repeating verbs in Japanese to indicate that one 'cannot (A) even if they want to', or 'due to some circumstances, can't (A)'. the case marking particle に will appear after a verb in its dictionary form , before the potential form of the same verb will be negated with ない. In this way, the more literal meaning is 'for (A), (A) is not possible'. It will be important to keep in mind that する does not have a potential form, so できない will be used in the latter half of this expression when paired with する verbs. Additionally, ない may sometimes be replaced with other structures that convey negation, such as ず. Caution Occasionally, the dictionary form of a verb will be replaced with the auxiliary verb う or よう volitional forms, and will then be followed by にも. The potential form of the same verb coming before ない will remain the same. Although the meanings are the same between both of these, the dictionary form tends to highlight psychological circumstances for why one 'cannot (A)', while the volitional form highlights more concrete or physical circumstances.",N1
の内で,～のうち(で),,"Of the, Among(st)","Coming from the noun 内 'within', のうち is a grammar pattern that appears after nouns or numbers, in order to signify 'amongst (A)' in the same way as の 中 . Like の 中 , のうち is often followed by で. However, it can also be followed by の when attached directly to another number. The noun specified by の 内 may represent a range or a limit, and is not limited to appearing with numbers. Like の 中 , it may also appear followed by から in place of で. のうち is far less common than のなか when specifying 'amongst', due to this, のなか will be the preferred (more natural) option in speech. Additionally, although coming from 内 , the kanji form is far less common than plain hiragana.",N2
う,〜ようとしない,,"Not willing to, Not make an effort to, To not attempt or try to, Volitional + としない","Like ～ ようと思う 'I think that I shall do (A)', ～ようとしない is a combination of a verb that has been grouped with the auxiliary verb う (or よう ), followed by the case marking particle と, and then another verb. In this case, する . ～ ようとしない is often translated as 'shall not (A)', but with emphasis on a lack of effort, or willingness. Caution As  ～ようとしない implies a lack of effort, this expression is usually quite negative, and mostly refers to other people, rather than the speaker themselves. If ～ようとしない were used to refer to the speaker, it will come across as 'I shall not do (A)', which would sound very abrupt/potentially rude. If speaking about yourself, ようと 思 わない may be used instead, meaning 'I don't think I shall do (A)', or 'I think I shan't do (A)'.",N3
よう,〜ようとしない,,"Not willing to, Not make an effort to, To not attempt or try to, Volitional + としない","Like ～ ようと思う 'I think that I shall do (A)', ～ようとしない is a combination of a verb that has been grouped with the auxiliary verb う (or よう ), followed by the case marking particle と, and then another verb.

う,ようが～まいが,,"Even if, No matter what, Whether or not, [Emphatic], Volitional + が","When both the positive and negative volitional auxiliary verbs are combined with a verb in Japanese, it has the nuance of 'whether or not (A)', the result will be (B)'. This is quite emphatic, and has a literal meaning similar to 'say it does (A) or say it doesn't (A), it will still be (B)'. As a reminder, the positive auxiliary verbs of volition are either う or よう, depending on what they are being connected to, while the negative auxiliary verb of volition is まい. Either the case marking particle が or と will appear after both the positive and the negative, with が being slightly more common. While this structure is primarily seen after verbs, it is important to remember that other auxiliary verbs such as だ can be conjugated in the same way, as can い-Adjectives with the less common かろう structure. This means that both nouns, な-Adjectives and い-Adjectives can also appear using a similar grammar pattern. However, because the negative volitional まい cannot pair with these structures, an antonym will usually appear with them instead, with both words using the う or よう positive volitional. Based primarily on the use of volitionals, this grammar pattern will often indicate the speaker's strong will or opinion that will not change regardless of (A).",N1
よう,ようが～まいが,,"Even if, No matter what, Whether or not, [Emphatic], Volitional + が","When both the positive and negative volitional auxiliary verbs are combined with a verb in Japanese, it has the nuance of 'whether or not (A)', the result will be (B)'.

んだ,～んです・のです,exp,"Explanatory, Emphasis, The fact is","のです is a construction with several different forms, each meaning roughly the same thing. This expression behaves similarly to だ and です by themselves (asserting that something is true). However, the addition of の strengthens the relationship being highlighted. Due to this, it will come across a bit like 'it is a fact that (A)' in English. In these sentences, we can think of the ん , or の as simply adding emphasis to the statement. Due to の adding emphasis, this expression will be heard very frequently in explanations. Caution There is no real difference between ん and の . Only の is considered 'correct Japanese', but ん evolved to make things easier to say. ん is the most common form in spoken Japanese, and the use of の could be considered a bit formal, or 'stiff'. While both the だ and です forms are equally as natural, only the です form will be used if adding か to the end ～んです か . This construction shows that the speaker is looking for an explanation about something.",N5

(),Adj限りだ,,"Extremely, Really, Very, As ... as one can be","限 りだ is a structure that follows adjectives in order to indicate that something is 'extremely (A)', or 'as (A) as can be'. This grammar pattern is simply a mix of the noun 限 り, 'limit', and the auxiliary verb だ, or です in the case of a polite sentence. Therefore, the literal meaning is just that something is 'the limit of (A)', where (A) is some describable feature. 限 りだ will follow adjectives in their standard form s. 限 りだ is a fairly formal grammar point that simply aims to highlight the intensity of traits as perceived by the speaker. As this perception is something coming from the speaker, the adjective itself will often be an emotion that the speaker themselves is experiencing, rather than a direct quality of the object, such as its color or shape. Some examples of this are as follows. 嬉 しい - The feeling of happiness, as experienced by the speaker. 頼 もしい - The feeling of reliability, as experienced by the speaker. 羨 ましい - The feeling of jealousy, as experienced by the speaker. 寂 しい - The feeling of lonliness, as experienced by the speaker. 恥 ずかしい - The feeling of embarrassment, as experienced by the speaker. 心強 い - The feeling of reassurance, as experienced by the speaker. As can be seen in all of the examples. The intensity of the adjective is something that will change depending on one speaker to the next, rather than something that the target is doing.",N1
～て,Adjective,prt,"And..., Both and (Conjunctive)","The て form of an い-Adjective , or で form of a noun (or な-Adjective ) is exactly the same as the て form of a verb, in that it carries the meaning of 'and', and is used for linking. Building on from the adjective +て, noun + で grammar point, instead of linking adjectives, adjective + て + (B) is used for linking an adjective to an entire phrase. With this construction, the phrase is simply added after て (with い-Adjectives ), or で (with nouns and な-Adjectives ), without any extra consideration for the phrase following it (this means that the (B) phrase will behave as if it was its own sentence). As with adjective +て, noun + で , it should be noted that て and で are different structures here. て is the same conjunction particle that is used with verbs (meaning that い-Adjectives are similar to verbs), while で is actually a form of だ that is used for conjugation. It is the same で as the one that is used in the formal version of だ , である . Which we will learn later. Caution Like other て forms ( ている 1 , ている 2 , and ている 3 ), the て (or で ) form of other words can have several possible meanings. These meanings are as follows. Linking - Like 'and' in English. Reasons - Like 'with (A)', or 'because of (A)' in English. Manner - Like 'to do (B) in an (A) way' in English.

For nouns and な-Adjectives , we will need to add で to the base form (not な or だ ). It should be noted that て and で are different structures here. て is the same conjunction particle that is used with verbs (meaning that い-Adjectives are similar to verbs), while で is actually a form of だ that is used for conjugation.

(),Adjective,exp,"The 'one' that... (Indefinite pronoun, Adjective nominalization)","One of the roles that the particle の can take in Japanese is replacing a noun that has already been mentioned, or one that has not been mentioned yet. In this way, it is similar to 'the one that (A)' in English. When using this expression, we will need to use な before の , when a な-Adjective is being used. When using this expression, の will be followed by は , が , or も , depending on what the speaker/writer wants to express. Caution の may be used more than once in the same sentence, referring to the same noun.",N5
させられる,Causative-Passive,,"Verbs (Causative-passive voice), To be made to do something, To be forced to do","When the auxiliary verb せる (or させる ) 'to make/let do' is combined with the auxiliary verb られる 'to be the receiver of', it creates the causative-passive form of verbs in Japanese. These sentences will be from the perspective of the person who has 'been made to do' something, and are very often negative (against the will of the speaker). First, verbs must be conjugated in the same way that they would be with せる , or させる . After that simply remove the る, and then add られる . This will create the verb form させられる (linked with る-Verbs ), or せられる (linked with う-Verbs ). As with the causative form, する and 来 る have special conjugation rules. する will be replaced completely by させられる , while 来 る will become 来 させられる . Caution Unlike with causative verbs, where the actual doer of a sentence (marked with が ) is considered to be the person who 'caused' the action, られる reverses the perspective. This makes the doer (marked with が ) the person who is being 'forced' to do something. When the person that is 'causing' the action appears in a causative-passive sentence, they will be marked with に . Caution れる may not be used in place of られる in causative-passive sentences. This is because せる and させる both have せ (an え sound kana) at the point where they will connect with られる . This is a rule for all verbs with an え sound kana at their conjugation point (excluding the 'potential' use of れる and られる ).",N4
せる,Verb［せる・させる］,,To make/let/have (somebody do something),"In order to express that someone was 'made to do', or 'let do' something, the auxiliary verbs せる and させる will be used. The meaning that せる and させる will convey (when attached to a verb) is called 使役 (causative, employment, or using) in Japanese. A common misconception is that せる and させる are standard conjugations of each verb. However, these auxiliary verbs should be thought of as having their own meaning, in a similar way to how たい , ない, だ , です , and other auxiliaries each have their own meanings. In order to use these grammar structures, remove the る from る-Verbs , and then add させる . For う-Verbs , change the last kana to the あ sound kana from within the same column (except for う, which becomes わ), and then add せる (る becomes ら, む becomes ま, く becomes か, etc.). As usual, する and 来 る have special conjugation rules. する will be replaced completely by させる (in a similar way to how できる completely replaces する in the ' potential ' form). 来 る will become 来 させる . Caution With causative, either に , or を can mark the doer of the action that せる, or させる is linked to (not が). This is because the actual 'doer' of the action is considered to be the person that is making/letting someone perform that action. に will usually imply that someone was 'let' do something, while を implies 'make'. Fun Fact Because the actual 'doer' in causative verb sentences will be marked with が (as is always the case), the literal translation of せる and させる is closer to the following: (A) が (B) に 楽しま せる - For (A) to cause fun 'in' (B). (A) が (B) を 楽しま せる - For (A) to cause fun 'through' (B). It is these standard meanings of the particles に (a location) and を (a target) that will create the 'let', or 'make' nuance when using せる , or させる .",N4

In order to use these grammar structures, remove the る from る-Verbs , and then add させる . For う-Verbs , change the last kana to the あ sound kana from within the same column (except for う, which becomes わ), and then add せる (る becomes ら, む becomes ま, く becomes か, etc.). As usual, する and 来 る have special conjugation rules. する will be replaced completely by させる (in a similar way to how できる completely replaces する in the ' potential ' form). 来 る will become 来 させる . Caution With causative, either に , or を can mark the doer of the action that せる, or させる is linked to (not が). This is because the actual 'doer' of the action is considered to be the person that is making/letting someone perform that action. に will usually imply that someone was 'let' do something, while を implies 'make'. Fun Fact Because the actual 'doer' in causative verb sentences will be marked with が (as is always the case), the literal translation of せる and させる is closer to the following: (A) が (B) に 楽しま せる - For (A) to cause fun 'in' (B). (A) が (B) を 楽しま せる - For (A) to cause fun 'through' (B). It is these standard meanings of the particles に (a location) and を (a target) that will create the 'let', or 'make' nuance when using せる , or させる .",N4
くない,い-Adjectives,adj-na,Not (Adjective),"The negative form of い-Adjectives in Japanese is created by using the conjunctive form of the adjective, followed by ない . conjunctive form just means 'agglutinative', or 'conjunctive' in Japanese. For い-Adjectives , this conjunctive form is created by removing い, and replacing it with く. The ない used with い-Adjectives is considered to be a different word to the ない used with verbs. When used with い-Adjectives , ない itself is also an い-Adjective . This means that it follows the same rules as regular い-Adjectives . Due to ません (the polite negative form) being an auxiliary verb ,  it cannot be conjugated with い-Adjectives in the same way as verbs. As can be seen here, you must first add the verb ある , and then conjugate it into its negative form using the auxiliary verb ません. This is how the polite negative is created. Caution As with regular い-Adjectives , you cannot use だ after ない . です is acceptable to create a semi-polite form, but is best used in spoken language only.",N5
(),Noun＋型,,"Model, Type, Pattern, Kind, Shape, Size(d)","型 , or sometimes 形 , are two kanji that are often used as a suffix , to identify that something is 'shaped', or 'sized' according to (A). The primary reading of both of these kanji is かた, but becomes がた due to 連濁 (sound changes due to conjugation). 型 can be attached directly to the end of nouns, or to い-Adjectives . Occasionally, 型 will be used after the case marking particle の. In these cases, because it is connected to の, and not directly to the noun, it will be read as かた, not がた. Although there are two different kanji that can be used in this expression, 型 will be used far more frequently than 形 . This is primarily due to the base meanings that these kanji have. Those meanings are as follows: 型 - Form (in regard to design, pattern, type, or model). 形 - Shape (in regard to physical shapes only. Square, rectangle, triangle, etc). Due to this, 型 is used when describing any form/pattern that is abstract, while 形 is primarily only used for describing very basic (visible) shapes. Caution Occasionally, 型 may be read as 型 , the 音 読 み (Chinese reading) of 型 . This is primarily when it is paired with other words that also use their 音 読 み, or when it is not acting as a suffix , but part of a set word.",N3
(),Number,,"No more than, Not exceeding, As few as・as little as, Only","The adverbial particle しか is often compared to だけ , in that it also expresses 'only'. However, unlike だけ , しか can only be used in negative statements . Due to this, しか～ない is regularly translated as 'there's only (A)', or 'there's nothing but (A)'. しか～ない may be used to express numbers, or nouns. In this lesson we will examine numbers. To use this construction, the number that you want to express as being 'all that exists' will go before しか , then しか will be followed by a verb in its ない, or ありません form. Fun Fact The main difference between しか and だけ , is that だけ suggests that (A) was 'chosen' from among a group where several other choices exist. しか on the other hand, implies that there are no other choices, and (A) is the only possibility/thing that exists.",N4
(),Number/Amount,,"At least, Sort of, Or so","The は particle has two primary functions. The first is to mark the topic of a sentence, as learned very early in our Japanese language journey. However, the second common usage of は is to highlight contrast (making a comparison). When は is used after a number/counter, it regularly has this comparison meaning. This can be translated as 'or so', or 'at least'. Before は , the counter is regularly followed by くらい (or ぐらい ). This just softens the statement, and further highlights the 'or so' meaning. Despite being translated as 'at least', the comparative meaning of は itself is what creates the nuance of this grammar structure. The thing before は is being highlighted as an amount, while also implying that there are other amounts. This implication of another amount makes は sound as if it could mean 'as opposed to (B)'. So in essence, this grammar structure sounds like 'As for (A), as opposed to (B)', where (B) is not usually mentioned.",N4
(),Particle,,Combined particles,"In Japanese, many particles are often grouped together with the case marking particle の. The primary function of this is to form a link between noun (A), and noun (B). In each of these cases, noun (B) will be considered to have all of the qualities described by noun (A), and the first particle that follows it. The particle that comes before の will always be something that adds some form of immediate information about noun (A). The most common ones are as follows: Noun (A) から の Noun (B) - The (B) that is 'from' (A). Noun (A) と の Noun (B) - The (B) that is 'grouped with' (A). Noun (A) へ の Noun (B) - The (B) that is 'toward' (A). Noun (A) で の Noun (B) - The (B) that 'done with' (A). Noun (A) まで の Noun (B) - The (B) that is 'until' (A). Caution Because noun (A) is describing noun (B), noun (B) will be considered as the subject of the statement. Due to this, particles that usually mark subjects, topics, or objects of actions cannot be paired directly with の. This includes に, も, は, が, and を .",N3
い-,い-Adjective,adj-na,"Was, Were (Past tense)","In order to create the past form of い-Adjectives , you must add the auxiliary verb た to the 'past' conjunction form of the い-Adjective . The past conjunction form is created by removing the い and replacing it with かっ. This structure is equivalent to 'was' in English. 面白 い - 'Interesting' in its base (dictionary form). 面白 かっ - The conjugation form used with た (and several other auxiliary verbs ). From these examples, we can see how the casual past form is constructed. In modern Japanese, simply adding です after た is considered to be the standard polite past form. Caution Although this is considered to be polite by most people, using です after かった is not academically correct Japanese. However, considering how common its usage has become, it may be used in almost any situation confidently.",N5
(-),Question-phrase,,Including questions within sentences,"Often, the adverbial particle か is used in the middle of a sentence, in the same way that it is as a sentence ending particle . The main differences are as follows: Adverbial Particle: 副助詞 - Highlights uncertain things ' 不確 かであること'. This is the same か as in どこか 'somewhere'. Sentence Ending Particle: 終助詞 - Highlights doubts and questions ' 疑問 や 質問 '. This is a direct question. In the case of the adverbial particle か and 'uncertain things', this will almost always be followed by a word that is seeking information about the uncertain thing. As can be seen in these examples, sometimes the adverbial particle will appear by itself, and sometimes it will appear together with the sentence ending particle in the same sentence. However, due to the 'uncertainty' being displayed by the adverbial particle, the question marker at the end of the sentence is not required. Caution This か should not be preceded by だ (or です ), this is why words like どこか and 誰 か are not どこ だか and 誰 だか.",N4
他動詞,他動詞・自動詞,,Done through action vs. occurring on its own,"The two most fundamental divisions that can be made with Japanese verbs are transitive verbs - the subject is moving/acting upon something else, and intransitive verbs - the subject themself is moving/acting. Sometimes these terms are simplified even further to 'other-move' (transitive), and 'self-move' (intransitive). Basically, this is the difference between verbs that require an object marked with を (transitive verbs), and those that only require が , to show that the subject itself is moving (intransitive). In Japanese, there are many transitive/intransitive pairs of verbs, and these will need to be memorized. Fun Fact In Japanese, the two ways in which all verbs can be described are an act/motion  ( 動作 ), and an act/motion upon something ( 作用 ). Fun Fact Although they are not traditionally grouped this way, する and なる may also be thought of as a transitive/intransitive pair. This is due to する always implying that something is being controlled (acted upon), while なる always implies that something happens on its own, or cannot be controlled.",N4

れる,Verb［れる・られる］,,"Was done to ~ by ~, Done without consent, Done to one's dismay","In Japanese, there are several ways to express that something 'passively' happens. All of these are done with the auxiliary verbs れる and られる . Japanese verbs in the passive form behave in a slightly different way than they do in English, so we will examine this difference more closely later. For now, let's focus on れる , られる , and さ れる (the form used with する verbs). Passivity in Japanese means that the person (or thing) that is the target of the action will be the subject of the sentence, rather than the person that is 'doing' whatever verb is being used. You can conjugate any Japanese verb into the passive form in the following way. For う-Verbs (godan verbs), simply replace the last kana with the equivalent あ sound kana from the same row (す becomes さ, つ becomes た, ぶ becomes ば, う becomes わ, like with ない, and so on), then add れる , or られる . For る-Verbs (ichidan verbs), just replace the る with られる . する and くる behave slightly differently than most other verbs. For する , it will become さ れる , while くる will become こ られる . As can be seen in these examples, the 'doer' of the verb will be marked with に , but から can also be used in cases where there is no physical contact with the subject. Caution られる can be used in several different situations. These are listed below. Passive: 受 け 身 - Something happens to the subject as a result of an external force (sometimes sounds negative). Possible: 可能 - There is the possibility for something to be done. Spontaneous: 自発 - Something happens by itself, or 'without instigation'. Respectful: 尊敬 - You are respecting someone by making them the subject of the sentence, despite someone else actually performing the verb. Fun Fact In Japanese, passivity focuses on the lack of control of the subject of the sentence. Due to this, the subject will sometimes be called the なる人, while the doer of the verb is called the する 人. Traditionally, many textbooks use the term ' passive ', simply because there is no equivalent verb type in English ( passive is the closest). However, we would like to introduce the term 'displacement verb'. This just means that the subject of the sentence is being described in a similar way to what happens in keigo (polite speech). Caution But wait, what about れる with る-Verbs ! Well, in Japanese, ら removal words 'ラ 抜 き 言葉 ' are very common. These are words that are able to use れる , instead of られる . The original meaning of both of these auxiliary verbs is exactly the same, but there are cases where ら may not be removed. The standard rules are as follows. ら may be removed - る-Verbs and くる , when the meaning is 'possible'. ら may not be removed - る-Verbs and くる , when the meaning is 'passive', 'spontaneous', or 'respectful'. In both of these sentences, the meaning is exactly the same. However, ラ 抜 き may only be used when られる is being used to highlight ' possibility '.",N4

れる,れる・られる,,"To be able, Can (Potential)","In addition to ' passive ' verbs, れる and られる (the auxiliary verbs ) are used when expressing possibility ' 可能 '. られる will be attached to the base form of る-Verbs (the form after る has been removed). Note also that れる and られる themselves behave like standard る-Verbs, so can be conjugated into a variety of different tenses in the same way as a standard verb. A common sight in modern Japanese is words where the ら may be removed, 'ラ 抜 き 言葉 ', and れる may be used by itself. However, this is not technically correct Japanese, and may cause confusion in cases where ら is required (with る-Verbs and くる , when られる is expressing 'passivity', 'respect', or 'spontaneous occurrence'). For う-Verbs , they will behave a little differently. Instead of the final kana of the verb changing to an あ sound, and then adding れる (as would be the case with passive verbs), the final kana of the verb will change to an え sound (る will become れ, う will become え, す will become せ, etc.) before adding る. Interestingly, する verbs do not have a ' potential ' form, and the verb できる will be used in its place. Caution ことができる and られる (when used in its ' potential ' meaning) have exactly the same nuance. However, many people consider ことができる to be slightly more polite. Fun Fact When using the potential form, either を or が may be used to mark the 'object'. You will need to be careful though, as this does not apply to できる , which may only ever use が .",N4

～て,Verb[て],,"Non-sequence, And, But (Contrast), Parallel action/state","One of the common functions that the conjunction particle て has, is that it can contrast things that share some sort of relationship. This is similar to the contrastive use of は . In order to identify this nuance of て , we will need to think about whether the things being described are happening one after the other, or are simply describing '(A), and then (B)'. Let's look at some examples. Due to this 'contrast' that is shown with て , sometimes it is translated as 'while (A), also (B)'. The primary difference between this nuance of て , and other 'while' or 'but' grammar points, is that (A) and (B) will always have equal weight/importance in a て sentence. Comparatively, structures like けど , のに , だが and similar points will usually imply that either (A) or (B) is more important in some way.",N4
～て,Verb[て],,"And・and so, Due to, Because of, Since, Conjunctive","One of the functions that the conjunction particle て performs in Japanese is very similar to 'since', or 'due to', in English. Phrases that use this particular (A) て (B) nuance of the て-form primarily express something that is beyond the control of the speaker in the (B) statement. To use this grammar construction, pair the て-form of a verb or い-Adjective with the (B) phrase. In the case of nouns and な-Adjectives , で (the particle) will be used instead. Fun Fact The 'because' nuance of て (or で ) in this grammar construction is primarily influenced by the (B) phrase being something that is uncontrollable, rather than being a different meaning of the particles て , or で themselves. Literally the meaning is closer to the following: (A) て 困 る - Being troubled cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て 嬉 しい - Being happy cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て 大変 - Having a problem cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て びっくり - Being surprised cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て 疲 れている - Being worn-out cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て 心配 - Feeling anxiety cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. Many other words, such as the ones listed above will cause て (or で ) to have a similar nuance. てすみません also uses this meaning of て , as すみません is a feeling that the speaker cannot control, relating to the situation being left unfinished.",N4
～て,Verb[て],,Please do for me (Casual request),"In casual speech, てください is often shortened to て . This usually comes across as being a friendly way to say 'please do (A)', but may sound like a very soft order, so is best used with friends/toward people of lower status. This nuance of て is usually able to be identified by appearing at the end of a sentence. Caution Sometimes, other forms of て may appear at the end of a sentence. This happens most often when the speaker has not actually finished speaking, but is thinking about what they want to say next. In these cases, the pronunciation of て will usually be extended (to highlight that the person is thinking). When emphasizing an apology, て may also be used. For this nuance to be conveyed, て will be attached to the 'reason' that the person is apologizing, and may be either positive or negative.",N4
～た,Verb［た・ている］+,exp,"Verb modified noun, Relative clause","In Japanese, if you want to describe something or someone that is performing an action, one of the ways you can do this is through a relative clause. A relative clause is when two phrases are joined into one sentence, rather than two individual sentences. The た (plain-past), or ている (continuous) form of verbs are usually used. る-Verbs and う-Verbs follow their regular conjugation rules when making a relative clause. In the first example, we can see that 'Takashi-san is a man that lives in Tokyo', is one sentence, rather than 'Takashi-san is a man. He lives in Tokyo'. In English, words like 'that', and 'which' are used to create a relative clause. However, seeing as though these words do not exist in Japanese, the first phrase is simply attached to the noun. Caution The ます (polite) forms of verbs may not be used when making a relative clause.",N5
(),Verb,,"Just, Even just, Even merely","As mentioned in our だに + しない grammar point, だに is an adverbial particle that shares a similar meaning to さえ and すら 'even', but is more commonly found in classical literature. It presents (A) as 'minimum' or 'light' examples, and therefore implies that anything greater than (A) would be more than can be handled, imagined, etc. In this use, it is often translated as 'just (A)', or 'merely (A)'. だに will appear directly following verbs in their dictionary form . This is a formal structure, and will be seen far more often in literature than it will be spoken. Despite this, it is actually quite common in anime and manga when characters are being dramatic. As (A) presents a 'minimum', it will often be a word which expresses something that depicts the difference between reality and fantasy. For example, if (A) was 想像 するだに 'even in my imagination'. The 'minimum' is the imagination, for which the opposite end of the spectrum would be 'in reality'.",N1
～てもいい,Verb,exp,"It's okay to, It's alright to, Can/may","Verb + てもいい is a construction in Japanese used to express that something is 'okay', or 'alright'. It can also be used as a question to ask if you 'can', or 'may' do something. This phrase is also regularly used without the も , but is considered a bit more direct/casual. It is best to remove the も only when talking to people that you know well. This expression is simply a construction that literally means て (verb) も (also) いい (is good). Caution As this grammar point uses the て form of verbs, it is important to remember that some verbs will use で instead of て .",N5
～て見せる,Verb[て],,"I will definitely, I will certainly, Just watch, Whatever it takes, I swear, for sure","て 見 せる , primarily written in hiragana, is an emphatic structure that indicates that the speaker is going to do (A) in a way that it is clear to the listener. This can be translated as 'I will definitely (A)', or 'I swear I will (A)', but the literal translation of 'I will show you that I'll do (A)' also makes the point clear. To use てみせる , simply alter the verb preceding it into its て-form. Due to みせる requiring a target for who the speaker is showing, this grammar pattern will only be used when there is either directly someone that will be shown (A), or when the speaker is talking about showing someone (A) that does not happen to be there at the moment either physically or temporally. It will not be used when simply strongly stating that you will do (A), unless who sees that (A) is important. In a sentence like this, where the person being shown is not obvious, it will come across as 'I'll show everyone'. As て 見 せる literally just means to 'show (A)', it will often be used without any special emphasis. Whether it is being used emphatically or not will usually be obvious from the overall context of the sentence.",N1
～て,Verb,prt,"And, And then, After that (sequence)","The て form of a verb, followed by another verb phrase is often translated to 'then', or 'and then', and is how Japanese lists sequences of events that happen one after another. Caution This grammar construction is used for listing things that happen in order, for example 'I did (A), then (B), then (C)'. Other grammar structures will need to be used if you would like to talk about things that happen/happened in no particular order. For example たり～たりする , which will appear in a sentence like 'I did things like (C), and (A), oh, and (B)!'",N5
～て,Verb[て]・Noun[で],,"By, With, On, By means of, ~ing with","The conjunction particle て , or the case marking particle で are often used to highlight when something is being 'used'. The thing being used does not necessarily need to indicate a tool, but can also indicate a circumstance/situation. In these cases, '(A) で (B)' translates as 'with/by means of (A), (B)'. Fun Fact With て (and で ), the nuance is quite often that '(A) allowed/led to (B)'. This may be a simple sequence of events, or may be through the direct use of a tool/situation. The nuance that is being highlighted will always depend on the (B) phrase. Due to this, it is important to always read the (B) clause, before deciding what the speaker is trying to convey.",N4
～て,Verb,v-unspec,"And, Then (Linking events)","In Japanese, て is a very important conjunction particle that can be used with many different structures. When it is partnered with a verb, it has special conjugation rules, depending on whether it is being added to a る-Verb or a う-Verb . In the case of う-Verbs , it also depends on what the preceding kana is. The most common translation in any situation is just 'and' or 'then', due to (B) being highlighted as something that happens/happened after (A). In these examples, we can see that て basically means '(A) て (B)' = '(A) happened, then (B)'. However, this is only when it is linked to another verb. Sometimes the て form appears as で . This is a change that happened throughout the course of history, in order to make sentences flow more smoothly. Despite this, there is no difference in meaning between て and で as a vocal change. The easiest way to identify whether to use て or で is by looking at the preceding kana. If the plain (dictionary) form of the verb finishes in ぐ, ぬ, ぶ, or む, then で will be used. る-Verbs never use で . Caution There are several irregular verbs when it comes to て form conjugation. Let's look at an example of each one. Apart from these 5 verbs, the rules for て form conjugation are 100% consistent.",N5
ないで,Verb[ないで],,"(Please) do not (for me), Casual request","ないでください is a polite way to express 'please don't do (A)'. However, such politeness is often not required, like in conversations between close friends. In these cases, ないで by itself may be used for the same purpose. Although grammatically the same as the ないで with the meaning of 'without doing (A), (B)', rather having a part (A) and a part (B) to the sentence, this ないで acts more like a simple statement. ないで combines the auxiliary verb ない, with the case marking particle , で . To use this structure, simply attach it to the negative stem of the verb that you wish to request someone not to do. The sentence itself usually finishes with ないで .",N4
ないものだろうか(),Verb[ない]もの(だろう)か,,"(Why) can’t, Isn’t there, Wish that, If only","When paired with negative expressions, the noun 物 and either the sentence-ending particle か or a combination of だろう and か will indicate that the speaker wishes (A) were possible, but for some reason it is beyond their immediate capacity. This structure may be translated as 'if only (A)', or 'isn't there a way to (A)', but the literal translation is closer to 'I wonder if it really is a thing that can't (A)'. This grammar pattern will primarily be seen attached to the negated form of verbs, but may also be used in reference to nouns when the ない is being used to indicate a lack of existence of (A), rather than a lack of ability to do (A). As can be seen in these examples, the polite でしょう may replace だろう. Additionally, similar structures such as かな or かしら may replace だろうか or でしょうか in more casual conversations.",N1
～に行く,Verb,exp,"To go ~, To go in order to ~","に 行 く is a grammar construction that is used when someone is going somewhere for the purpose of doing (A). (A) representing the verb that comes before に 行 く . As with other uses of に , this particle is highlighting an end point or goal of 'going'. When using this structure, it will be important to remember that (A) will appear in its stem form, before に 行 く gets attached to the end. This grammar point is regularly translated as 'to go in order to (A)'. If you have already 'gone' somewhere for the purpose of doing something, then you would use '(A) に 来 た ', while at the location.",N5
れる,れる・られる,,"Do as (one is told or ordered…), In accordance with, In compliance with, Just like","When paired with まま, a noun meaning 'in the state of', and the case marking particle に, the auxiliary verbs れる and られる indicate something being done 'as one is told', or 'as ordered'. Because of this, れる and られる will almost always be paired with verbs that indicate some kind of communication. As these structures are in the passive, the literal translation is close to 'to do (B) in the state that (A) was done to me'. The (B) part will come directly after ままに and simply states how someone is going to react in compliance with (A). The conjunction particle が may appear between られる and ままに, but this is not common in modern Japanese. Although it does carry the meaning of 'but', the focus is more on expressing that the (A) is not being resisted or argued with when doing (B).

られる,れる・られる,,"Do as (one is told or ordered…), In accordance with, In compliance with, Just like","When paired with まま, a noun meaning 'in the state of', and the case marking particle に, the auxiliary verbs れる and られる indicate something being done 'as one is told', or 'as ordered'. Because of this, れる and られる will almost always be paired with verbs that indicate some kind of communication. As these structures are in the passive, the literal translation is close to 'to do (B) in the state that (A) was done to me'. The (B) part will come directly after ままに and simply states how someone is going to react in compliance with (A). The conjunction particle が may appear between られる and ままに, but this is not common in modern Japanese. Although it does carry the meaning of 'but', the focus is more on expressing that the (A) is not being resisted or argued with when doing (B). Caution In this grammar pattern, られる will never appear in the past-tense form.",N1
う,Verb[volitional]とする,,"Try to, Attempt to, To be about to","When combined with the auxiliary verb う (or よう), とする carries the meaning of 'to try to do (A)', or 'to be about to do (A)'. The case marking particle と in this expression highlights a 'result'. To use おうとする , modify the (A) verb into its う or よう receiving form, and then add とする. As う and よう mark volition (the express intent to do something), とする adds the nuance that the express intent has been decided, and all that remains is to 'do' the action. This translates quite closely to 'to endeavor to do' in English, where the past form 'endeavored to do' will suggest that the attempt was unsuccessful. Caution ようとする is also regularly used to indicate when one action interrupts another. In these cases, the nuance is not quite 'to have endeavored', but more '(A) was already underway, when (B)'. Again, it will just show that the (A) action was decided upon 100%, when something caused an unexpected change.",N3

う,Verb[volitional],,"Tried to ~ but ~, Was about to ~ but ~, Was going to ~ but ~","As mentioned in our ようとする lesson, when combined with the auxiliary verb う (or よう), とする carries the meaning of 'to try to do (A)', or 'to be about to do (A)'. The case marking particle と in this expression highlights a 'result'. However, the addition of structures like the conjunction particles が, or たら , to the past tense of する will indicate that something interrupted (A), and therefore it was unable to be completed. In these cases, the translation becomes 'to have tried to do (A), but (B)', 'was about to (A), but (B), or 'was on the verge of (A), but (B)'. う and よう mark volition (the express intent to do something), while とする adds the nuance that the express intent has been decided, and all that remains is to 'do' the action. Due to this, when something interrupts a ようとする verb, it strongly suggests that (B) is/was highly unanticipated.",N3
