Alternatively, あげく may be used to express some sort of troublesome or negative process that led to the conclusion of (B). In these cases, the outcome itself may not be undesirable, but arriving at that result of (B) somehow was. Caution あげく will most often be in hiragana, but the forms 挙句 and 挙 げ 句 are also quite common. Fun-fact 挙句 originally referred to the final line of a 連歌 (a form of early Japanese poetry), and literally means 'the tying up phrase', or 'the concluding phrase'."

                        "content": "In Japanese, あとで is a combination of the noun 後 (behind), and the particle で (with). When these words are linked, they form an adverbial phrase which is used to express 'after', or 'later'. As with で 's standard meaning of 'with', あとで is simply highlighting that something will happen, 'with' the 'after/behind' part of something. To use あとで , attach it to the end of any past-tense verb, noun followed by の , or verb followed by のは (nominalization). Fun Fact The reason that 後 is translated as both 'after', and 'behind', is because sequences of events in Japanese behave similarly to a train. When the head of the train (one action) passes a specific point, there are still potentially many carriages (other actions) coming 'after', or 'behind' it. 後 で may also be used to alter the meaning of an entire phrase, by appearing at the front. This nuance is just that (A) will happen (at some point) after now."

To use あまり, you will need to attach it to the end of the following structures. A verb, an い-Adjective (that has been turned into a noun through the use of さ or み) followed by の, a な-Adjective followed by な, or a noun followed by の. Then, after あまり, a (B) phrase will highlight what the negative result was. Caution The tense of the overall sentence will be dependent on the first clause.

In these sentences, we can see that the first い in いい changes to よ, depending on the form. This is unique to いい , and does not happen with other adjectives. いい can sometimes be seen as 良 い , in these cases, the kanji is likely to be read as よい, and not いい. There is technically no difference between these two meanings, but よい does sound more formal/old-fashioned. Caution When used as an adverb, よく should not be confused as a conjugation of いい . よく has several possible kanji that it may stem from, and means frequently/often/well."

To use 以外 , attach it to the thing that you want to highlight as being the 'all inclusive' amount/area. Fun Fact 以外 is also regularly used simply as an expression of surprise, when someone sees, hears, or reads something that is 'outside' of what they expected. However, in these cases, the more correct kanji construction is 意外 'out of mind'. This is a regular mistake that even native speakers make, so in many  cases, either 意外 or 以外 would be understandable."

This is a combination of the adverbial particle も and the adverb 何 ともない 'doesn't amount to anything'. なんともない is often grouped with other negative structures in order to show that the thing it is linked to is not a large amount or considerable extent. In many cases, 何 ともない illustrates that the extent of the thing that it follows is not sufficient to cause a problem. Because of this ～くもなんともない will often be used in sentences where (A) is something that could potentially be an issue, but the speaker is expressing that it has not reached that point, or does not go that far. Because of this, ～くもなんともない is frequently used with adjectives that describe sensations or emotions. Caution This structure is also commonly used with the auxiliary adjective たい, for showing that someone 'doesn't want to do (A)'."

                        "content": "In Japanese, い-Adjectives are known as 'form containing words', and are used to describe nouns. All い-Adjectives end in い in their base form. As mentioned, all い-Adjectives end in い in their base form. However, not all words ending in い are い-Adjectives . Let's take a look at some of the words that are commonly mistaken for い-Adjectives . In addition to きらい above, there is also きれい. きれい actually comes from the kanji structure 綺麗 , with い being part of the kanji itself. This is never the case with い-Adjectives , where the い will always be outside of the kanji. Due to the kanji for 綺麗 being somewhat difficult, this word is often written in hiragana or katakana, which leads to confusion for learners. Unfortunately there is no rule for distinguishing which words ending in い are not い-Adjectives , but thankfully, there are not very many of them, so it won't be long before you become familiar with them. Caution Unlike な-Adjectives , い-Adjectives must never be followed by だ . This is due to だ only being able to conjugate with nouns (which な-Adjectives originally are). Instead, です is used with い-Adjectives to make them sound more polite. Fun Fact Although using です with い-Adjectives is very common, it is actually incorrect Japanese. As です is simply a polite variation of だ , it follows all of the same conjugation rules as だ . This means that it should only be attached to nouns and な-Adjectives . However, as most Japanese natives do not know this rule, it is widely considered natural to use."

                        "content": "置 きに  is  a combination of 置 き, a suffix meaning 'opening' or 'interval', and the case marking particle に. Primarily written without kanji, it is an expression used to show that something happens 'every (A)', or 'at intervals of (A)'. The difference between something being interpreted as 'every', or 'at intervals of' can be tricky though, so we'll look at both. Due to おきに being a suffix , it will be attached to the end of numbers, counters, or any 'space' that it is highlighting as being an 'opening' or 'interval'. Looking at these sentences, we can see that the 'interval' is a bit difficult to understand even in English. However, the easier way to think of おきに in this sense is 'leaving a space of (A), (B)'. So if we say 'leaving a space of two days, (B)', it becomes a bit clearer that something is happening during the third day. Caution It is very common to get ごとに and おきに mixed up. The former literally means 'every'. However, the latter having the meaning of 'at intervals' makes things confusing. おきに itself will only mean 'every' sometimes. Let's look at some examples of when these two expressions overlap in meaning, and when they do not. Large time frames or distances - Only ごとに will be used to express 'every'. It makes sense to ask 'at what point' during a day, a week, or a month. Due to this, only おきに will mean 'after the interval of (A)', while ごとに means 'every'. Small time frames or distances - Both ごとに and おきに may be used to express 'every'. It doesn't make sense to care about 'at what point' during seconds, minutes, or hours. Here, because おきに points at the interval, it will mean 'every interval of one second' etc, because nobody is going to ask 'when did (B) happen during the next second', so the space is just assumed to be 'one second'. In summary, おきに will mean 'every (A)' for seconds, minutes, hours, millimeters, centimeters, and kilometers. But it will mean 'with spaces of' for almost anything bigger than that. This is not an exception to the rule, it is just a change of focus as spaces get larger. We can just remember that おきに always has one job. It highlights that (B) occurs after or outside of (A). While ごとに highlights (B) happening within (A). 一秒 おきに - The space is 'one second', so if おきに points to the beginning of the next second, the space is still only 'one second'. Because おきに doesn't care about where (B) happens within that next second, we assume straight away. 五年 おきに - The space is 'five years', so if おきに points to the beginning of the next year, the space becomes 'six years', because we are going to want to know where (B) happens within that next year. It would be strange to assume someone is waiting for New Year of the sixth year to do something instantly. Fun Fact This is a topic that native speakers frequently get wrong themselves, so don't worry if it takes a while to understand! If you are unsure about which one to use, think of 置 きに as 'leaving intervals of (A), (B)' for most purposes. 一時間 tends to be the upper limit of time that most people disagree about whether the meaning is 'every hour', or 'every second hour'. This makes sense, as the time frame is short, but still sort of long, so whether someone takes it as the beginning of the hour or some point during that hour being the important information, their opinions may differ. Remember though, おきに itself only ever points to the beginning of the space after (A), it doesn't care when/where (B) happens afterward."

In this lesson, we will focus on actions that are 'ending'. To say that (A) is ending/finishing, we will need to attach おわる to the ます stem of almost any verb. Whether you use the hiragana form, or the kanji form does not matter, as there will be no change in nuance. Due to おわる being a verb itself, the tense can be changed to show that something will end, is ending, or has ended. Caution Unlike はじめる , which uses the transitive form, 終 わる uses the intransitive form of its transitive/intransitive pair. This is due to most actions in Japanese being considered to be things that 'come to an end' naturally (intransitive), rather than forcefully (transitive). However, there are exceptions to this, and 終 える (the transitive version) may also be seen used as an auxiliary to other verbs."

Naturally, due to being a polite sentence pattern, お～ 願 う will almost always appear in it's ます-form, お～ 願 います . Interestingly, words of western origin, such as katakana loanwords, will often omit both お and ご , appearing simply with 願 う attached to the end.

This word will be translated as ‘in addition to doing (A), (B)’, ‘along with (A), (B)’, or ‘incidentally to (A), (B)’. Both (A) and (B) usually have an equal level of priority, but (B) will have the nuance of ‘while (A), also (B) in passing’. かたがた will attach to the end of a noun that marks (A), while (B) will often, but not always, mark a verb of action. In cases where (A) is a noun that would usually take する, the する will be omitted entirely. Caution かたがた is a formal structure that will primarily be seen in writing, but also has a tendency to be used as a part of either apologies or thanks. Due to this, it will tend to sound unnatural if there is no special purpose for the linked actions."

This is quite a few particles combined together, but the literal meaning is more simply 'if (A) were to be asked', before the speaker will go on to highlight their reasoning in (B). 何 で, 何 , どちら, 誰 , どの, and similar words often appear as the 'who', 'where', or 'which' words in these sentences. As ～かというと will come before some sort of explanation, から will also regularly be used at the end of the sentence as 'because', emphasizing the speaker's reasoning. Caution Like other grammar points that utilize the 'if' nuance of と , ば , and sometimes even たら may be used. However, たら will appear far less frequently than と or ば ."

Combining the meanings か and な, we can see where かな gets its original meaning. か presents questions (usually to other people), while な shows that a statement is related purely to the speaker's own thoughts/opinions. In this way, かな expresses that the speaker's own thoughts are being questioned. Fun Fact In the past, かな was thought of as being a fairly feminine way to express 'I wonder', and males tended to use phrases like だろうか to express the same type of statement. However, in modern day Japanese, かな is used by both men and women equally."

Together these can be translated as 'whether (A)'. によって 違 う is made up of the case marking particle に (highlighting a location), the て form of よる (a う - Verb), followed by 違 う 'to differ', (another う - Verb). All together, this can be translated as '(A) depends on (B)'. More accurately though, the meaning is 'whether (A) will differ depending on (B)'. かは is regularly used after an entire phrase, followed by a noun and then によって 違 う . Alternatively, かどうか may be used instead of かは. This changes the nuance from 'whether (A)', to 'whether or not (A)'. When translated directly, かどうか is quite similar to 'whether (A) or however'. Finally, this expression may also be seen without 違 う. In a sentence like this, 'differs' is simply removed, becoming 'whether (A) will depend on (B)'. As conjugation between the verbs is no longer required, によって will become による ."

It is used to express when the speaker is making a partially objective opinion about (A). This frequently comes across as 'judging from (A)', or 'based on (A)'. The literal meaning is 'going from (A), (B)'. This simply highlights that (A) is the only information or method available from which an assessment can be made, so 'going from that information, (B) can be said', or 'going with that method, (B) can be said'. からして will appear directly after the noun which indicates either the method or information from which a judgment will then be made. As からして is partially objective, this just means that the speaker does not have the full information available to say anything with certainty, and is therefore making a guess about (A) based purely on what appears to be true. Due to this, からして sentences often have the nuance of 'from the available piece of information about (A), (B) is likely the whole picture'."

The second part of the sentence will then make some statement about that determination. This may either be a personal opinion about the situation, or what the speaker intends to do about it. Caution Sometimes, からは may be seen by itself. However, this pattern is relatively more formal, and will not usually be used in spoken language."

Literally, it just means 'while not knowing whether (A) or not (A), (B)'. The verb that appears before か and ないか must be repeated in this grammar pattern, and may be used in its dictionary form. Standard translations include 'right after (A)', 'as soon as (A)', and 'barely when (A)'. Additionally, か～ないかのうちに may be used to highlight relatively short periods of time within which something happens. This is usually in regard to some sort of positive or negative occurrence that would not usually be expected to be able to happen so quickly."

Because the things being described in these examples are not considered to be 'alive', ある is the verb that will be used. いる is used for living things. The polite form of ある conjugates as あります . Due to the る changing to り, we can determine that ある is a う-Verb (Godan verb) . However, ある is irregular in that the plain negative form is ない , not あらない. The kanji form of 有 る is quite common, and should be learned as early as possible, to save any confusion while reading. There is no nuance difference between this expression being used with, or without kanji, and is up to the preference of the writer. Caution The が in がある is often omitted in casual speech, or writing that behaves like casual speech (manga, instant messaging, etc)."

However, in the case of がたい , it will be attached to the conjunctive form of verbs, and conveys that '(A) is difficult to do'. がたい is almost always written without kanji in this meaning. Compared to にくい , which can simply imply that something is 'uncomfortable' to do, がたい refers almost exclusively to 困難 であること 'things that involve a high degree of difficulty, distress, or infeasibility'. Due to this, がたい will come across as far stronger than にくい , and may imply that a certain task is almost impossible. Summed up, these nuances basically translate as the following: にくい - Something is difficult based on someone's opinion, experience, or general feeling. がたい - Something is difficult based on the task itself having a high level of difficulty."

As a more literal translation, 嫌 いがある can be thought of as 'having the displeasure of (A)', with the actual 'tendency' merely being implied. Due to 嫌 いがある being quite strong, it is frequently used together with words that will slightly soften the meaning, such as 少 し 'a little bit', or どうも 'try as one might'. Caution As 嫌 いがある will be used to describe things that are 'displeasurable' from the point of view of the speaker, it will usually not be used in relation to oneself."

This structure is often used to criticize the actions of others, and is used in a similar way to 'despite', 'even though', or 'and yet' in English. As くせ is a noun, くせに may be used after the attributive form of any other word. Fun Fact 癖 is a word that has developed a 'negative' meaning over time. Originally, 癖 was used to convey a preference, or the side that someone or something tended to lean toward (due to it being favorable for some reason). When adding the case marking particle に to this, it merely expressed that (A) was the preferable state/location, so (B) not being/not acting in a way appropriate for (A) is less than desirable."

These verbs are くれる , あげる , and もらう . くれる means 'to give' (to you, or someone that is part of your 'in' group). With くれる and あげる , they both function in the regular way you would expect (regarding particles). This means that が will always mark the giver (the person performing the action), and に will mark the recipient (the person that is the 'destination' of the thing that is given). This means that を will be used to mark the 'object' that is given, as is usually the case. The giver/recipient are often omitted from sentences with くれる , as one/both are usually obvious from context, or the sentence may be focussing on the object. As can be seen here, the same nuance is kept, even when things are omitted. Fun Fact What someone considers their 'in' group will be different for each person, but usually consists of members of your family, clubs that you are in, or something similar that has a 'group' atmosphere (that you are a part of). The giver will always be someone that is more distant than the people that are in the 'group'. Caution When we want to say that we (or someone else) gave something to someone that is not in our 'in' group, we will need to use あげる instead."

These are particles that function by connecting the (A) and (B) parts of a sentence. けど works very similarly to が , in that it highlights 'while thinking about (A), (B)'. This means that けど will often come across as 'but' in English. As can be seen from these examples, just like many other grammatical constructions, だ will be required when using けど after a な-Adjective , or a noun. けど is just a modern (casual) version of けれども . Please see below for a list of the most casual, to the most formal variations. Casual - けど - けども - けれど - けれども - が - Formal. Caution The phrase after けど will often be omitted if it is obvious, or the speaker does not want to say it."

This is a classical verb form that does not have a modern counterpart. However, the hypothetical form has largely replaced the realis form in the manner in conjugates. The verbs that will be seen altered this way are する ‘to do’, なる ‘to become’, and ある ‘to be’. They will respectively become こそすれ , こそなれ, and こそあれ , and are used specifically for emphasis. Common translations include ‘certainly not (B), but (A)’, or ‘even though (B), actually (A)’. The (B) phrase in this grammar point will include a negative statement, and is usually something that the speaker is responding to or correcting about what another person mistakenly thought. こそすれ may attach to either the noun part of する-Verbs, or the conjunctive form of standard verbs. なれ and あれ will be used based on the standard rules of what type of word なる would usually appear with (a noun or adjective), and what type of word ある would usually appear with (a noun). Caution There are cases where the base verb will have been entered in some way, like by having the causative or the passive auxiliary verbs attached to them before the new base will be altered with こそする. So you will need to work out what verb stem is actually being used in any given sentence."

Caution ことがある differs from たことがある (a phrase commonly paired with the past form of verbs). たことがある highlights a single event in which the (A) verb was completed.

These are as follows: 願望 や 軽 い 命令 を 表 す - Highlighting a desire or weak command. 感嘆 や 疑問 を 表 す - Highlighting astonishment or doubt. We will focus on the first meaning in this grammar point, as the 'astonishment' nuance is not as commonly used in modern Japanese, and is primarily used only by women. At the end of a sentence, こと will be paired with the dictionary (or ない) form of a verb, to highlight a particular action that either should, or should not occur. It is usually grouped with the auxiliary verb だ , although this is not always the case. This construction is most often translated as 'should/should not (A)', or 'ought to/not (A)'. Caution This use of こと implies a certain level of 'authority', and is therefore regularly used in relation to set rules and expectations (can very frequently be seen on signs in shops/parks, etc). Due to this, it should not be used when giving 'general' advice, especially to people of higher status."

Literally this grammar structure can be translated as 'to do (A)', or 'to make it (A)'. ことにする may be used with verb-phrases that are either in the affirmative, or negative (using ない) forms. As こと itself is a noun , the verb (or auxiliary verb) that comes before it will need to be in its attributive form . にする is a strong expression, which tends to make the speaker sound like they are fairly resolute in their decision. Caution The する in にする itself may also be seen using ない, to mean that someone has decided 'against' doing something. Due to this, careful attention will need to be paid to the overall structure of the sentence."

It is utilized in a similar way to くらい , but has a few differences. When ごろ is used, it will need to be attached to the end of a noun, or a noun followed by の . The main difference between ころ and くらい is that ころ can be (and often is) used to express a broad point in time, while くらい is limited to expressing timeframes that are more specific. Conversely, ころ will not be used when expressing approximate distances/lengths. The primary reason for this is that ころ expresses a span of something, while くらい expresses an extent. In this way, ころ could also be translated as 'within the span of (A)', while くらい is closer to 'at the point of (A)'. As an easier way to think about it, if we have a one meter ruler, ころ could express anywhere between 1 to 100 centimeters (the span), but くらい can only express somewhere between 90 and 100 centimeters (the extent). Just like with English, if the 'time' expressed is very specific, then either くらい or ころ could be used naturally. This is due to the 'span', and the 'extent' already being something that is a 'precise point' in these cases. Caution The kanji form of 頃 is also very common, so it is worth learning as soon as possible, to save any confusion while reading."

'I dare to say that (A)' is probably the closest to the literal meaning of さぞ , as the speaker is empathizing with someone else by trying to imagine the situation from their point of view. As さぞ is an adverb, it will usually appear at the beginning of a sentence, modifying the whole phrase that follows. The phrase following さぞ will often finish with だろう or でしょう. This highlights the speaker's opinion about the situation as being limited by their own knowledge. Caution さぞ comes from the kanji 嘸 , which has two alternative readings, 嘸 や, and 嘸 かし. Both 嘸 や, and 嘸 かし are occasionally used as even further emphasized versions of さぞ . Despite being almost identical in meaning, さぞかし is used more often than さぞや."

These are as follows: 誘 い、 促 し - To invite, incite, or draw attention to something. 驚 き、 当惑 し - The express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment. 話 の 流 れ を 抑 える - To control or keep in check the flow of a conversation. In this lesson, we will be focusing on the second meaning (to express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment). In English, this is used in a very similar way to 'like', 'you know', 'uhh', and other short phrases that are employed when a speaker is searching for the right thing to say, and is filling the silence. This さ may be used in any position within a sentence, simply to create thinking time. The 'confusion' that this さ expresses is not necessarily a bad thing, and is used by many people to simply express that they have not finished talking yet."

It keeps the same negation 'not' meaning as ず, and will conjugate with verbs in the same way as ない. ざる will also often be translated as 'un~', like in 'unstoppable'. In most cases, ざる will be seen attached to verbs that are describing a noun that comes directly after them. Although ざる may be used in place of ない, in modern Japanese it is primarily only seen as part of common expressions or sayings, such as the ざるを 得 ない 'have no choice but to (A)' grammar structure. Caution As with many old-fashioned grammar patterns, ざる will conjugate with the せ stem of する, rather than the more modern し stem. Fun-fact Some dictionaries list ざる as the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb ざり. However, ざり itself is just a contraction of ず and あり 'to be'. Due to this, both variations may be considered as correct, with ず being the underlying origination."

Like しか～ない , the construction used for expressing numbers, when used before a noun, this expression will mean that nothing apart from that one 'thing' exists. Any verb may be used after しか , but it must be in its ない (or ありません) form. Caution When しかない directly follows a verb, the translation is a little bit different, and means that 'nothing apart from (A) can be done'.

In this lesson, we will further explore this usage. Unlike じゃない and ではない (which need to come after a noun or な-Adjective ), じゃないか is able to be attached to the end of almost any phrase, to indicate a question. This is very similar to finishing a sentence with 'isn't it?' in English. When じゃないか is too casual, ではないか will be used instead. Despite being more formal, this may sound a bit stiff at times, so is best only used when politeness is expected."

                        "content": "すぎる is a verb that is used in Japanese to mean 'to exceed', or 'to go past'. It keeps this meaning when it is attached to other words, and creates the Japanese equivalent of saying that something is 'too much'. すぎる can be joined to the ます stem of verbs, the stem form of い-Adjectives (simply remove the い), or the stem form of な-Adjectives (simply remove the な ). With すぎる , the る is regularly omitted, with すぎ being used by itself. This is a casual language pattern, and something you will hear all the time. This variation may be used with any word that すぎる would usually be used with. There are a few rules that you will need to be careful about when using すぎる . The first of these unique rules is using すぎる with ない . When linked to ない , the い changes to さ, creating the structure なさすぎる . This means 'too much not (A)', or more naturally in English 'not enough (A)'. As with regular ない forms, では or じゃ will be required when used after な-Adjectives . In the third example here, we can see that the さ has been omitted. This is technically not correct Japanese, but has become very common among young people, so it still sounds natural. The second unique rule is when using すぎる with いい to mean 'too good'. Because すぎる is used with the stem form of い-Adjectives , you will need to remember that the stem form of いい is not actually い, but よ. This means that よすぎる would be correct, while いすぎる is not. Caution Because すぎる itself is a verb, it can also appear in the negative form, this confuses a lot of learners, and is something that needs to be practiced. Let's have a look at all of the ways that すぎる could possibly appear with ない . Because the meaning is different in each one of these sentences, depending on where the ない is, and how many ない 's there are, you may need to be careful while reading these, until it starts to feel natural."

                        "content": "すら is an adverbial particle in Japanese that basically translates as 'even'. The primary difference between it and も is that すら tends to present far more extreme examples to which a specific rule applies, and therefore also applies to all other less extreme examples. In most cases すら will be used with a negative nuance. As すら is an adverbial particle, it will be seen directly after nouns, or nouns followed by case-marking particles. すら may also be followed by も in order to emphasize the point even further. Caution すら and さえ are relatively similar in terms of strength. However, すら is more formal and cannot be used in the さえ～ば construction. すら also tends to be the most extreme example from within a large group, while さえ places more emphasis on a specific individual. Fun Fact は, も, さえ, and すら are all adverbial particles that share a linear relationship in regards to the way that they are used. This relationship refers to the intensity of how (A) fits into a group. This can be imagined as follows. (A) は - (A) is as expected, and there is nothing surprising about it.

Like しまう, ずじまい will often indicate regret at something ending up a certain way. However, this regret is about '(A) not happening', due to the negation provided by ず. This structure will be used following the indeterminate form of verbs. Common translations include 'to end up not (A)', and 'to not have done (A) in the end'. ずじまい will often be followed by だった or でした, indicating that (A) was not something that turned out happening, despite the wishes or intentions of the doer. Caution As is always the case with ず, する will be altered to せず."

This structure is just a mix of ず, a literary auxiliary verb that attaches to verbs in the same way as ない (and has the same meaning), に, and 済 む, a う-Verb meaning 'to come to pass', or 'to end up'. Literally, it can be thought of as meaning 'it will work out without (A)'. As mentioned, ず connects to verbs in the same way as ない, so this structure will be seen after the verbs that they are negating. As the primary element in this grammar point that controls the meaning is 済 む, other negations such as ないですむ , or なしですむ may also be seen. 無 しで functions as a suffix , so may be used directly after nouns, unlike ないで and ずに. In most cases, (A) will be something that is thought of as unpleasant or bothersome, therefore highlighting the speaker's relief that it can be avoided."

Something that the speaker has no control over, or a conclusion/determination that the speaker wants to confirm is correct (based on their understanding of the previous statement). When そうすると is used to draw a conclusion about another person's statement, the translation is closer to 'so you mean to say (A)', or 'if so, then (A)'.

It is a combination of the auxiliary verb そう, the adverbial particle も, and the い-Adjective ない. To recap, one of the primary uses of そう is to highlight appearance . Therefore, そうもない literally means 'to not even appear like (A)'. This structure will be used after verbs in their conjunctive form . Caution そうもない is very similar to そうにない. The primary difference being that そうもない is stronger. This is due to も expressing something that is surprising (or for emphasis), while に simply marks a location (or state) within which something does or does not exist. The difference can be understood as follows: (A) そうもない - To not even look like (A), where 'even' emphasizes (A). (A) そうにない - To not be looking like (A), where 'be' marks where (A) is 'not' existing. Caution そうもない is an expression that is very commonly used with potential verbs, in order to convey that the 'possibility' of something cannot be observed. While this translates as 'to not appear as if (A) can be done', realistically it comes across quite strongly, similar to 'to not stand a chance of doing (A)'."

However, it may still occasionally be used in negative circumstances, to highlight their (unfortunate) result. Fun Fact 為 is an exceptionally flexible kanji in Japanese. In addition to ため it is occasionally used for する 'to do', なる 'to become', なす 'to bring about', and つくる 'to make'. The kanji itself means 'to put (something) to use', with heavy emphasis on whatever new state/result will be arrived at afterwards. This meaning can be seen reflected in all of 為 's readings."

The thing that それ is 'substituting' for is the entire clause/sentence that came before it, while に highlights that extra information is about to be added. In this way, it translates to 'and to that', or 'and on that', where 'that' is the previous information. Often, it is translated simply as 'moreover', 'in addition', or 'and'. Because それに is 'adding' information with に , the (B) information itself must be something that would logically happen 'in addition to (A)', or 'as a result of (A)'. Therefore, それに will highlight something that has either all positive, or all negative connotations. Never both."

The auxiliary verb た will be added to the verb indicating what you have done, followed by こと - が - ある . Like の , こと is regularly used for nominalization (creating a noun-like phrase). However, の cannot replace こと in this particular grammar pattern. From these examples, we can see that ない (the negative equivalent of ある ) may also be used, when you want to express that you have 'never' done something. Caution Just like English, many set phrases cannot be adjusted in Japanese (in the same way that こと cannot be swapped with の in this expression). Fun Fact In expressions where こと is followed by a verb phrase, の may not be used. When used for nominalization, の is almost always followed by a noun or adjective phrase. Here are some examples."

Common translations include 'even if (A)', 'even though (A)', or 'no matter how (A)'. In the case of verbs, たって conjugates in the standard way that the た past-tense form usually would. For い-Adjectives, たって attaches to the conjugative く-form. For nouns and な-Adjectives, た will change to だ, and だって will then be used with the stem noun or adjective. Fun-fact Although たって is widely considered a casual form of ても, it originally stems from たとて, which is a combination of the auxiliary verb た, and the particle とて, which itself is thought to be an old-fashioned abbreviation of と 言 っても. In this way, the modern abbreviation of たって still reflects the original extended nuance of たと 言 っても 'even if (A) is said, (B)'."

Limit: 限定 - Highlights the 'limit' of something (similar to だけ ). Completion: 完了 - Highlights the 'end', or 'completion' of something. In this lesson, we will focus primarily on the completion meaning. When connecting ばかり to the past form of a verb (using た), it will imply that a specific action has 'just finished', 'just stopped', or 'just been completed'. Fun Fact Despite having three different meanings, ばかり can be thought of as always highlighting how close one thing is to another. Degree: 程度 - Highlights (A)'s degree of closeness (to a stated amount). Limit: 限定 - Highlights (A)'s degree of closeness (to a description). Completion: 完了 - Highlights (A)'s degree of closeness (to a point in time)."

Like ～るまでだ, ～たまでだ may be replaced with ～たまでのことだ, depending on what the speaker is trying to emphasize. As this structure emphasizes that (A) is not a big deal, it will often be used in order to modestly highlight that one only did the bare minimum, and therefore praising them is unnecessary. Caution Both ～るまでだ and ～たまでだ are only used in reference to one's own personal actions, or the actions of a group they are affiliated with."

                        "content": "The conjunction particle たら is used as a kind of 'halfway point' between 'if' and 'when' in Japanese. It expresses the completion of an (A) action, and then a (B) action that is considered to be the result of (A). It may be hypothetical, or it may be presenting a one-time result of something that happened in the past. To use たら , it will replace た in the simple past form of verbs, い-Adjectives , な-Adjectives , and nouns. Caution Despite appearing to be the past form of the word that it is attached to, たら itself does not actually carry the nuance of 'past'. Other words in the sentence will need to be examined to see whether たら is truly highlighting something from the past, or simply the completion of something (which may or may not happen in the future). Fun Fact Although たら is regularly used to mean 'if', it almost always has a nuance of 'when'. This is due to たら specifically highlighting the following situations: Completion: 完了 - Completion of (A). Materialization: 成立 - Coming to fruition of (A). These meanings are opposed to other 'if' structures like ば , and なら , which focus far more strongly on the hypothetical 'if' meaning."

As with other adverbs that highlight amounts, 大体 can be used to modify entire phrases, or can be used directly before a noun as 大体 の + noun. In a similar way to そもそも, a noun/adverb which means 'in the first place', 大体 can also have this meaning. This nuance is frequently quite obvious, as the rest of the sentence will highlight a desired outcome that unfortunately did not happen. Although these 2 primary uses of 大体 may seem quite different, they are both just expressing what is 'essentially' correct, most common, the original, etc. Fun Fact A common synonym for 大体 is 根本 , a noun which means 'the source', or 'the origin' or something. In this way, 大体 just expresses the way something is, without receiving any alterations (regardless of whether any subsequent alterations are positive or negative). This is where the 'in essence' meaning comes from."

It is used when indicating that something about (A) is 'as expected', or 'not surprising'. As a literal translation, it can be thought that the meaning is close to 'just in that it is (A), (B)', and expresses that simply because (A) is (A), (B) is to be expected. だけのことはある will often appear with other words that add emphasis to the expectation of (A), such as さすが, やはり, or やっぱり. This grammar pattern may be seen following verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns. な will be required after な-Adjectives. In the case of nouns and な-Adjectives, it is also possible to see だっただけのことはある when highlighting that some particular result is not surprising. Caution だけのことはある is not used to indicate negative expectations, so will only appear when the overall sentence is a positive evaluation of what was expected of (A)."

Originally, it comes from the kanji construction 段々 , which can be thought of as meaning 'step by step', 'stepwise', or even 'steadily'. だんだん is similar to ほとんど , in that it can modify the meaning of entire phrases, rather than just single words. To use だんだん , simply put it before the phrase that you want to express as '(A) that is increasing steadily'. While だんだん can take the particle と , it is not required. In fact, と is very often omitted from adverbs/onomatopoeic words (words that represent a sound or motion) in Japanese. Caution Initially, it can be easy to mix-up だんだん , with どんどん . どんどん is an onomatopoeic word that represents loud banging (like on a drum), so is used to express fast changes/progression. This is unlike だんだん , which expresses slower changes/progression."

Due to this, the literal meaning of 序 に may be thought of as 'with (A) as the precedence, (B)'. 序 に is commonly used with verbs, or nouns. In the case of nouns, it will need to be preceded by the case marking particle の. Fun Fact Just like 'precedence' in English, 序 に implies that (A) is the instigator for (B). Because of this, 序 に is a good way to convey that something is not urgent, but, if (A) is happening, it is the perfect chance to do (B) as well. Caution 序 に is more formal than 間 に or 時 に, so has more of a tendency to be used for 'one-off' things, rather than regular occurrences. Despite this, it still may be used to describe regular occurrences at times, especially when speaking formally or politely, such as to a senpai."

To use this grammar point, you will need to attach て to any verb, and then follow it with いく. This nuance is usually that '(A) happened and then went', or 'will happen, and then go'. In other words, it will depend on whether いく is in present, or past tense. ていく can be used when representing time, or when representing a physical place. When representing a physical place, it is more likely that the kanji structure, 行 く will be used. However, this is not a set rule, and depends on the writer. When used in relation to time, the nuance is usually that something has already started/is about to start, and then will continue to progress in the same way. This is the opposite of てくる , which indicates that something has finally reached a certain state, after progressing in that way for some time. Fun Fact When compared to English, ていく is very similar to the phrase 'to go on to (A)', in relation to time. It focuses on the fact that the speaker is required to make some type of journey to arrive at a specific point. For example, 'She went on to become a doctor after university'."

This is for things that are not 'continuing', but happen so often that they are considered to be continuous (like going to work, having a hobby, and similar things). Due to いる being one of the verbs for 'existing' in Japanese, the ている form is closer to 'continuing to exist in a specific state', rather than (A)~ing in English. In this construction, it can be thought of as 'to be existing in the state of performing a regular activity'. Caution With this meaning of ている , to make it easier to understand, expressions of time are often used. This can be things like 毎日 , 毎晩 , 毎週 , and similar phrases. Fun Fact Regularly in novels, manga, and specifically some parts of Japan, とる may be used instead of ている with the same meaning."

The primary difference is that 呉 れる (primarily written in hiragana) means to 'bestow to the speaker' (or someone in the speakers inner circle). In this way, てくれる is the opposite of てあげる , which conveys that someone (usually the speaker) gives (an action) to another person that is outside of their inner circle. てくれる is commonly translated as 'would you do (A) for me', as a question, or 'someone did (A) for me', as a statement. When asking for a favor, てくれる can be shortened to てくれ . However, this is very casual, and should not be used with strangers (or anyone that you do not know well). As an English equivalent, てくれ sounds similar to phrases like 'would ya do (A)', or 'could ya do (A)?' Fun Fact てくれる is one of the most casual ways to ask for a favor, with てもらう being slightly more polite. ていただく (the humble speech variation of てくれる ) is even more polite than either of these!"

Phrases that use this particular (A) て (B) nuance of the て-form primarily express something that is beyond the control of the speaker in the (B) statement. Coming from the verb 済 む (to finish), すみません (the negated form) means 'to be unfinished'. In this way, てすみません literally means that the speaker feels that something is 'unfinished due to (A)'. This is very similar to phrases like 'having unfinished business' in English. Although the translation is 'I'm sorry', perhaps it would be easier to remember this grammar structure as highlighting someone's regret/unfinished feelings about (A), and simply showing that to the person that is being apologized to."

It is the combination of a verb in て form, the は particle, and the negative potential form of 行 く (to be able to go). In this way, it literally means '(A) cannot/is not able to go'. Although は can be dropped from many phrases and expressions, the は in this particular grammar point is usually not. This is because いけない would then become the second action in a sequence of events (the usual function of て form). However, to make this more casual, て は is often changed to ちゃ (ては becomes ちゃ), or じゃ (では becomes じゃ), as this is easier to say. Caution Apart from いけない ; ならない and だめ are also frequently used to get across the same meaning. However, they are used in different situations. いけない - Fairly neutral. Used in both spoken and written language. ならない - Fairly formal. Used mostly in written language. だめ - Very casual. Used almost exclusively in spoken language."

The (A) and (B) actions will often be things that contrast each other in some respect, such as starting and stopping, walking and running, going forwards and then backwards, etc. ては～ては will be used with verbs in the て-form, so will occasionally appear as では. The abbreviated versions of ちゃ and じゃ may also be seen with the grammar point, but it may be considered unnatural if the same abbreviation is not used both times. This is mainly due to the level of formality being required to stay the same within sentences. Caution ては may sometimes appear only once, without any change to the meaning of repetition. This is usually when there is some indication in the rest of the sentence that the action is something that is being repeated over and over."

This is created by removing the い and then replacing it with く. This phrase is also regularly used without the も , but is considered a bit more direct/casual in those cases. It is best to remove the も only when talking to people that you know well. てもいい is an expression that literally means て (noun, etc) も (also) いい (is good). Similarly to the てもいい grammar point that is used with verbs, this variant may also be used as a question. To do this, you simply need to follow てもいい with です か , or the more casual の ."

Both structures are usually translated as 'even if (A), (B)', or 'no matter if (A), (B)'. Despite this, the more literal meaning of each is closer to 'so it's (A), (B) still won't be affected'. This just emphasizes the fact that (A) is of no relation to the result, like saying 'so what if it is' in English. When used consecutively, であれ shows that regardless of whether something is (A) or (B), the result of (C), will not change. Both であれ and であろうと will primarily attach to nouns in sentences that express some kind of question or assumption through words like どんな or たとえ. Caution Although ～であれ～であれ implies 'no matter whether it is (A) or (B)', both (A) and (B) in these types of sentences usually fall under the same category, as (C) needs to be something that links them logically. For example (A) may be 'a plane', and (B) may be 'a submarine', while (C) will be describing something about them both being vehicles."

This is a combination of the case-marking particle と, and the hypothetical form of the う-Verb ある 'to be', あれば. とあれば will primarily follow nouns, but is occasionally also seen after other structures such as verbs and adjectives when the と is being used as a quotation . (A) is often some special circumstance or condition that leads to the conclusion or assumption of (B), were (A) to be accurate. As this expression is emphatic, (B) will usually indicate something that must be done, or can't be avoided with structures like しかない, なければならない, ざるを得ない, etc. Fun Fact とあれば tends to appear with のため before it quite often. This can be translated as 'if for the purpose of (A)', and will describe the lengths that the speaker is willing to go for (A) in (B)."

This grammar point is a combination of と (the particle), 言 う (the verb), and こと (the noun). Together, the literal translation is close to 'that (A) is said to be'. However, in reality, it sounds far less formal than this. To use ということ , attach it to the end of any phrase (without です , or ます). In most cases it will be written using hiragana. In conversation, という is regularly shortened to simply って . This form will be heard/seen much more frequently in conversation/manga and similar things. ということ is also frequently used when clarifying what someone else has said. In these cases, it translates very similarly to 'you mean that (A)?', or 'you mean to say that (A)?' Caution Although the kanji 言 う and 事 may be used in this expression, the most common form does not use any kanji at all. This is a regular occurance in Japanese, as many set grammatical structures will not use kanji, simply because it makes the pattern easier to identify."

This is usually translated as 'my impression of (A) is that'. However, the more literal translation is closer to '(A) is just a thing that'. This emphasizes that the speaker has high certainty that what they are saying (based on their experience) is the true nature of (A) in most cases. というものだ is constructed of という, the noun 物 'thing', and だ. It will be seen at the end of phrases that the speaker or writer is making a judgment about. As this grammar pattern is quite direct, it is often used when criticizing something. However, this is not always the case, so will need to be judged based on context. Caution In casual conversation, という may be shortened simply to って, without any change in meaning."

The noun 点 'point' can be thought of as directly indicating the aspect of (A) that is being focused on. Literally, the meaning is 'if considered from the aspect of (A), (B)'. This expression often follows either verbs or nouns, However, when following nouns, の may occasionally replace という, especially in cases where it is a simple noun, rather than an entire quotation that just happens to finish with a noun. Fun-fact Although a combination of the quotation particle と and the う-Verb 言 う 'to say', という is mostly written in hiragana and considered to be a set phrase which simply indicates that the contents of the phrase preceding it requires explaining in some way."

                        "content": "とうとう is an adverb that is used to express that something 'finally' happens. In Japanese, there are a few ways to do this, but とうとう is one of the more common. Coming from the kanji 到頭 , this structure literally means 到 (to arrive at), 頭 (the head of/crux of) something. Due to this, 'finally', and 'after all' are the two most common translations of とうとう . Like many other adverbs in Japanese, とうとう is often used at the beginning of a phrase/sentence. While とうとう is written in hiragana the majority of the time, knowing the kanji will help when trying to remember the expression's nuance. That nuance is that something has 'ended', usually after some sort of long journey/effort. This adverb may be used to express either positive or negative outcomes, as it focuses more on the time required to achieve the result, rather than the result being good or bad. Caution とうとう is not used in situations where you expect something to happen/start, but there has not actually been a period of time in which some sort of effort was made to achieve a result. A good example of this is the changing of seasons. You might want to say 'finally, it's summer!', but this is not something that anyone has done anything to achieve. Rather, it came naturally. In these cases, いよいよ will be used, and has the nuance of 'finally', or 'at last' (in relation to something starting/happening)."

When multiple things are listed, the last item in the list can (and often does) have とか omitted. Caution とか is used to list items in a non-exhaustive way. What this means is that the listener will assume that there are other items in the list, apart from what is stated directly. The speaker is just providing a few examples of a (potentially much larger) category. Fun Fact As we have seen, とか may be used with verb phrases. This is in contrast to や , a similar grammar point that can only be used for listing nouns."

This is not to be confused with the alternative translation of ときたら which is ‘that damned (A)’ when used for criticism. ときたら will attach to the end of a phrase marking what the conversation is ‘concerning’, before that topic will then be explained further. In other words, (A) will present the topic, while (B) will indicate the speaker’s first instinctive thoughts about that topic. For the speaker, (A) is usually something that strongly makes them think of (B). However, it may just be that the relationship between (A) and (B) is a thing that the speaker is implying as obvious, or that goes without saying. Due to this, the (B) phrase often begins with やっぱり or やはり ‘sure enough’."

Caution The main difference between と as a case marking particle and と as a conjunction particle is that the case-marking particle will always link a single word/phrase to one specific word/result. The conjunction particle on the other hand, will often be followed by a 読点 (Japanese comma), as it is separating two distinct thoughts within the sentence, rather than just a simple 'result'."

This nuance of 'as' simply assumes that (A) is a plain or unchanging fact from which something (usually an opinion or evaluation) is based. Combining this nuance of と with して (the conjugation form of する ), として will present (A) as the base point from which (B) can be determined. Despite being a combination of several individual parts, として is often considered to be a 副助詞 (adverbial particle) by itself, meaning that it will most often be seen connected directly to nouns. As として works in the same way as a 副助詞 , it may be connected directly to a second noun to express that (B) is something functioning as (A). Fun Fact This result use of と regularly appears when one particular aspect of something is being highlighted (while other aspects still exist). This simply means that nothing apart from (A) is being considered when expressing (B)."

As this structure begins with と, it may be used at the end of any standard statement. In most situations, the way that とはいえ will be used is like the English 'say that it is (A), that still doesn't change (B)'. (A) will generally be something that is true, or true as far as the speaker knows."

In English, it translates very similarly as 'to think that (A)' in that it expresses a strong emotional response without expressly saying what that exact response is. とは is a combination of the case-marking particle と in its quotation use, and the adverbial particle は. In this way, it is just marking the whole statement of (A) as what is being highlighted as the topic, without actually stating anything else about it. とは may sometimes be seen following など or similar structures, and in these cases will just imply that 'something like (A)' is what is shocking. Caution Although it is common for とは to come at the end of a sentence with the actual feeling word omitted, the speaker may expressly state their reaction afterwards."

It will be seen after the dictionary form of verbs, and can be thought of as literally meaning something similar to 'even while not intending to (B), while (A), (B)'. ともなしに is similar, but pairs the noun なし 'without' with に, instead of using the conjugative form of ない. ともなく and ともなしに will often be seen in sentences that use たら. This puts emphasis on the specific time that something happened while performing another action absentmindedly. Despite translating this way, the action that precedes ともなく itself will be intentional, but the thing that comes about as a result of performing that action will not be what the doer was aiming to achieve."

Due to this, a more literal translation is 'I thought it had (A), but I guess (B)'. Despite the origin of the phrase, in modern Japanese と 思 いきや is just thought of as an emphatic structure that highlights the speaker's surprise in relation to something not being as they had expected. と 思 いきや may follow any word in its standard form . The particle か may appear before と 思 いきや , but this just further emphasizes the same rhetorical question, as や itself has the same role. Caution A past tense phrase will always appear in (B), as it is considered to be the actual situation which has come about, or has been realized by the speaker."

This structure is used when the speaker is asking a question about whether someone will choose (A) or (B). It is only used when there are no more than two possible choices. As can be seen above, verbs may be used as part of this structure if they are nominalized with こと , or の . Additionally, the polite form does not specifically need to be used, and どっち may be used instead. The second と itself is quite often omitted, as どちら (or どっち) implies that both (A) and (B) are part of the same structure. Fun Fact As どちら is the polite speech form of 誰 , it is also frequently used as a polite way to ask questions about unknown people. Caution どちらのほう (or どっちのほう) may also be used, but this does not really change the overall nuance. It merely puts slightly more emphasis on the 'direction' of the choice. This is similar to expressions like 'which one are you leaning towards?' in English."

Due to this, どうやら simply strengthens the uncertainty of things that the speaker is already unsure about. This is in a similar fashion to phrases like 'in some way it seems like (A)'. Like many adverbs that express amount or speculation, どうやら will appear at the beginning of sentences and modify the meaning of the entire phrase. Fun-fact While classified as a standalone adverb, どうやら is originally a combination of どう 'how' and やら, a 助詞 (particle) that is used for denoting uncertainty about singular things or lists. With this in mind, it is similar to the way that 'or whatever', or 'or some such' may be added to a sentence in English in order to emphasize that (A) is not certain."

Caution どの is only used when there are 3 or more possible choices, and どっち （ の ）・ どちら （ の ） will be used when there are only 2 possible choices. In the first example, the speaker is asking specifically about 2 options 'red or blue', so どっち will be used.

This is a structure that is comprised of verbs in the negative form connected to で, は, and the negative-potential form of the る-Verb 居 る 'to be'. In this way it just means 'to be unable to be without (A)'. ないではいられない primarily expresses the inability of the speaker to tolerate (A) not happening, due to wanting to do it. It may also indicate that they will unfortunately do it despite knowing that they shouldn't. ないではいられない may also be used to highlight that in the situation of (A), some particular emotion, feeling, or reaction cannot be repressed. (B) is something that happens naturally as a consequence of (A)."

With する verbs, the conjugation rules are slightly different. する will become し, and then 直 す will be connected in the regular fashion. In some situations, する may be replaced with やる (a very casual equivalent of する ). As やる is a う-Verb , it will be conjugated as やり 直 す . Caution 直 す (to fix) should not be confused with 治 す (to heal/mend). The kanji 直 literally means 'straight', or 'direct', and implies that one should 'straighten out' something."

It is regularly paired directly with other adjectives, or before nouns (with の coming between なかなか and the noun). なかなか can also sometimes have the nuance of being something that is 軽視 し がたい . This basically translates as 'difficult to dismiss', but is a bit closer to English expressions like 'nothing to scoff at', or 'not to be taken lightly'. Fun Fact なかなか highlights that something is 'considerably/extremely (A)', or 'far more (A) than expected'. If we imagine a dartboard, where the whole board shows the intensity level of a specific word, and なかなか represents the bullseye, this is basically the nuance. '(A) is the middle (bullseye) example of (B)'. Fun Fact なかなか, coming from the kanji 中 meaning 'within', can be thought to mean the 'middle' or 'most' (A)."

It may appear as either なしには, なしでは, or なくしては , with little variation in meaning. It is a combination of the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective ない, なく, the conjunction particle して, which highlights the word before it as a condition from which a determination can be made, and the adverbial particle は. As the second part of なくしては sentences will also be negative, we can see the more literal meaning of 'from the lack of (A), a lack of (B) can be determined'. This 'determination' comes across quite strongly, and may be interpreted as '(B) is impossible without (A)'. なくしては will appear after either nouns, or phrases that have been nominalized with こと. As mentioned previously, なしには and なしでは may also be seen. These are just the noun 無 し 'without', paired with either of the particle combinations には or では. なくしては is the most formal of the three. The (B) part of なくしては sentences will almost always be some state of completion or desirable outcome that cannot be achieved without (A)."

However, it is important to remember that this is actually a double negative, and therefore means 'If (A) is not done, it cannot go', or more simply '(A) cannot not be done'. To make this construction, the auxiliary verb ない will need to be conjugated with ば , creating なければ (if not). After this, いけない (to not be able to go) will be added to the end. As learned in the なきゃ lesson, なければ may be shortened to なきゃ . This structure is frequently used either with or without the added いけない . Caution While いけない (to not be able to go) and ならない (to not become) are quite similar, ならない will rarely be used outside of formal situations, or in writing. Due to this, いけない will be heard much more frequently in speech (when it is not omitted)."

Depending on what the speaker wants to convey, なし is often partnered with the auxiliary verb だ , or its conjunctive form で. なしで will mean '(A) that is without (B)'. When connected directly to another noun, の will be required after なし . Again, this will mean '(A) that is without (B)'. なし does not always need to be connected directly to another noun. Often, it can be used in reference to an event or thing that someone wants to skip, or avoid. In cases like this, it may be paired with the case marking particle に , to show determination to avoid something. Caution 無 し is quite different to 抜 き, another suffix-like structure that is used to convey 'without (A)'. The primary difference is in the original meanings of these words. Having a relationship with ない, なし simply means 'without'. 抜 き comes from the う - Verb 抜 く 'to remove'. Due to this, 抜 き implies the intentional removal of something. Often 抜 き and 無 し are interchangeable, but not always."

                        "content": "A predicate is a word that describes the topic/subject of a sentence. The Japanese equivalent of this is a 述語 , which literally means 'statement word'. As a predicate , な-Adjectives can appear by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used at the end of a sentence. It is important to remember that all な-Adjectives can also function as nouns, and therefore tend to sound more like a noun than an adjective, when used as a predicate . When there are no other words apart from the adjective itself, it comes across similarly to 'It's pretty', or 'It's hated', and similar expressions in English. We just have to guess what the 'it' is from context. Caution Unlike い-Adjectives , な-Adjectives change form depending on where they are in the sentence. At the end of a sentence, they will always be followed by だ , or です (except in casual conversation where だ is omitted). However, when used before the word they are describing, they will always be followed by な . Hence the name な-Adjectives . In many sentences, either は or が could be used to mark the word/words that the predicate is describing. Which one sounds more natural will depend on many factors. In general, if you are specifically pointing out something as being different from other things in the same category, が will be used. In this example, が is distinguishing a specific station as having a unique level of dirtiness compared to others. は would sound unnatural in this type of sentence. Fun Fact Most な-Adjectives are words of foreign (Chinese/English) origin."

The particle に indicates a location, while あって is the て-form of the う-Verb ある 'to be'. As such, にあって can be and is often translated simply as 'in the situation of (A)', or 'under the conditions of (A)'. にあって will be used after a noun marking the condition, before the second clause will then go on to explain something remarkable or noteworthy about that situation or circumstance. Occasionally, にあって will be followed by も. This slightly alters the meaning and indicates that despite being in the noteworthy situation of (A), (B) is not being affected in the way that one would expect. Caution Be careful not to get にあって mixed up with the にあって used in sentences like 事故 にあって 'to meet with an accident'. This あって is a conjugation of 遭 う, 'to meet or happen upon (often something negative)', while the あって is this grammar point is simply the て-form of ある."

This is frequently translated as 'from the point of view of (A)', or 'from the standpoint of (A)'. Literally, it means something close to 'if we go off (A)', and just highlights that the speaker is choosing a particular aspect of (A) to discuss as a possibility. In many cases, the (B) part of にしたら or にすれば expressions will be an opinion about what the speaker expects to be true for (A). にしたら and にすれば are structures that will be used after nouns that identify people or organizations, from which the speaker will then make an assumption about them/it. Although almost identical in meaning, にすれば will be the preferred choice in formal sentences. Caution - にしたら and にすれば are hypothetical grammar structures that make some sort of assumption about (A), they will not be used in regard to oneself, and one's own opinions. This can be thought of as a function of にする itself, in that you can't 'go off' yourself hypothetically, as you already are yourself, and already know your own thoughts."

This expression is constructed from に, and the negated form of the る-Verb 過 ぎる, meaning 'to exceed', or 'to be more than'. Due to this, the literal translation of 'to not be more than (A)' reflects the English interpretations closely. にすぎない is slightly formal, but is heard fairly often in day-to-day speech as well. This grammar pattern may be used after verbs in any of their standard forms, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns. にすぎない is often seen paired with structures that will emphasize the phrase even further, such as ただ 'merely' or だけ 'just'. In the case of だけ, it will come between the target word and にすぎない. Also, standard conjugation rules will need to be remembered, such as adding な after a な-Adjective before だけ. Fun-fact にすぎない may occasionally appear in set phrases, such as 氷山 の 一角 にすぎない , which means 'to merely be the tip of the iceberg'."

As this grammar pattern is used in polite speech , the word that it is attached to is often preceded by either お or ご, depending on what type of verb it is. Caution When not used as a polite expression, には 及 ばない may simply show the extent of something. This is usually when a comparison is being made between two things.

This is a combination of the case marking particle に, the う - Verb, 基 づく 'to originate from', and the conjunction particle て. This expression regularly highlights some kind of judgement/conclusion that the speaker has made, using (A) as their base. To use に 基 づいて , put the noun (or noun phrase) that you would like to identify as a 'basis' before に 基 づいて , and then express your judgment/conclusion in part (B) of the sentence. Alternatively, the past form of 基 づく may be used when connected directly to a second noun. (A) に 基 づいた (B) directly expresses that (B) is based on (A). Fun Fact The kanji 基 is fairly accurately translated as 'foundation', and is regularly used to highlight things that 'stem' from something. Due to this, に 基 づいて may also be used to identify things that are 'produced from (A)', 'created from (A)', or 'invented based on (A)'."

Acts as the separation point between the (A) and (B) parts of a sentence. Made up of the case marking particle に , and the う - Verb よる in its て form. による - Generally used at the end of a sentence, to highlight that the previous statement depends on (A). により - Almost always used before a comma. Acts as the separation point between the (A) and (B) parts of a sentence. Made up of the case marking particle に , and the う - Verb よる in its conjunctive form . To use any of these constructions, attach them to the end of a noun that you want to express as being the 'dependent' thing. Caution による may also sometimes be followed by a noun. In these cases, it will become a verb modified noun, and highlight that (B) resulted from (A). Fun Fact Although よる is almost always written in hiragana, there are several different kanji that use this reading. They all share similar meanings. Learn more about this in the によると grammar point."

In all of these meanings, the base interpretation of 'to accompany' is being highlighted. As 'accompanying' does not specifically indicate that (A) is controlling (B), this grammar structure may be used simply to indicate things that happen at the same time, rather than when something is being directly caused by the first. However, (A) having a strong influence on the change of (B) is usually implied. に 伴 う may also appear directly before another noun when it is being modified by the verb. に 伴 って is used both for events that are progressively changing at the same time, and momentary events that cause a sudden change."

Often, this structure will be translated as 'in addition to (A), (B)', or 'not only (A), but also (B). Being that it is a formal phrase, に 加 えて will also often appear in its formal-conjunctive form に 加 え . To use にくわえて , simply place it directly after the noun that you would like to highlight as being the base information, before discussing what exactly is 'in addition' to that base in the following clause. Both the kanji and hiragana forms of this structure are fairly common, so it will be beneficial to remember both. Caution にくわえて is frequently used when (B) is something that is in addition to (A) in respect to magnifying what was already true of (A). This just means that it will often be used to highlight something being brought about by (B) that would not be possible with just (A) by itself. This increase may be either positive or negative."

Due to this, when combined with the case marking particle に , に 当 たる will be translated as 'to correspond to', 'to amount to', 'to be appropriate for', or 'to be in regard to'. These may seem quite different, but we will examine the similarities shortly. To use に 当 たる , attach it to the end of an (A) noun that you would like to mark as being the 'point of reference'. (B) may come directly after に 当 たる , or earlier in the sentence, so long as it is clearly separated from (A). As for the link between に 対 して and に 当 たる , it is as follows. In に 対 して, (A) and (B) exist simultaneously, but (B) opposes something about (A). に 当 たる , (A) and (B) exist simultaneously, but (B) matches something about (A). Due to this, unless the speaker is specifically trying to highlight something that is 'opposing', or 'matching', the base meaning of '(A) and (B) existing simultaneously' may be the standard translation."

This comparative meaning aims to illustrate (B) from the perspective of (A), and usually refers to situations, level of experience, or something similar. To use this structure, attach the case-marking particle に to the end of a noun, then follow it with 照 らして. If a second noun will be modified directly, then 照 らした will be used instead. Keep in mind that the に in this structure is marking (A) as the 'doer' of 照 らす 'to illuminate', as it is a transitive verb. This means that the structure has a more literal translation of '(B) as reflected by (A)'. This can also be thought of as 'as made clear by (A), (B)', 'as made evident by (A), (B)'. (B) will almost always be a judgment that is logically based on (A)."

Common translations include 'only when (A), did (B)', and 'going as far as to (A), (B)'.

As with many other grammar structures that use verbs, occasionally the formal conjunctive 至 り will replace the standard て-form 至 って.

This structure is formal, so will mostly be used in literature or formal speech settings.

This means that the negative form of 足 る is 足 らない, not 足 りない. Caution Both 足 りない and 足 らない may be used as part of the set phrase 取 るに 足 りない, 'to be worthless', or 'to not be worth taking up for discussion'."

However, unlike 際 に , に 際 して is a combination of に, and the て-form of 際 する, which is a verb that usually has the meaning of 'to come to pass'. Despite the more literal translation of 'when (A) comes to pass', に 際 して will often just be interpreted as 'on the occasion of (A)', or 'at the time of (A)'. This is a formal grammar pattern that is seen connected either to nouns, or verbs in their dictionary form. Caution While there are many similarities between 際 に and に 際 して , a few key differences exist. The first being that に 際 して is primarily used when (B) is something that will be done before (A), or when presented with the situation of (A). However, in the case of 際 に , the nuance is more specifically 'on the occasion of (A)', marking the exact point in time, rather than the approach to that time. Following on from this example, because に 際 して highlights the approach to a specific situation, it will never appear connected to verbs in the past tense. 際 に , on the other hand, frequently appears with verbs in the past tense, as it can highlight the 'occasion' of an action being complete."

Alternatively, it may just be used for artistic expression, or to make a character seem 'classical'. In the case that the verb being negated is いる, the old fashion おる will be modified to おらぬ instead. Alternatively, する will be negated as せぬ , and くる will be negated as こぬ . This is consistent with the standard conjugation patterns seen with the use of ず."

This particular expression is used with the plain ( dictionary ) form of verbs only. In these examples, we can see that there is no difference between Ichidan verbs and Godan verbs . Both will be used in their plain forms. In this expression, のが is performing the same function as in the regular のは or のが construction. This function is nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun). However, のは may not be used with this phrase, as が will always appear with adjectives. Caution If you want to express that you liked doing something (in the past), the verb will still remain in the plain form, but 好 き will change to past tense. This construction can also be used to ask questions about what other people like. This is done through the addition of か ."

The connection that ので makes between (A), and (B), is similar to から , meaning that it is often translated as 'because', or 'since'. When used after な-Adjectives or nouns, な must precede ので . When used as 'since', ので puts emphasis on the sentence as a whole, or on the effects caused. It then examines those reasons objectively (in a way that is based on facts, rather than feelings or opinions). から tends to be more subjective, and can sound much more vague when used as 'because'. We can see here that から is not quite as strong as ので . This relates back to the base meaning of から being ' from ', rather than ' because '. Caution ので can sometimes be seen as んで , which is a more casual variation. Also, unlike many grammar points that connect to verbs, ので may be used with the ます form. This is something that is unique to conjunction particles."

As with many conjunction particles, な will be required after a noun/ な-Adjective , but before のに . It is also possible to see だ のに , instead of なのに , but this is something that is only seen in certain dialects, and would be considered incorrect by the vast majority of native speakers. Fun Fact Regardless of having two quite different translations ('despite', and 'in order to'), のに always functions in the same way. In the situation of '(A) のに , (B)', (B) is/will be the result. The only difference between how the nuance will be read, is whether the (B) statement is a logical conclusion, or an illogical one. When logical, the meaning is usually 'in order to', when 'illogical', the meaning is usually 'despite'."

This expression indicates that something is 'not just (A), but also (B)', or 'not only (A), but (B) too'. のみ connects to words in the same way as だけ, so this pattern will be seen following Verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns. Occasionally, のみならず may function as a conjunction, appearing at the beginning of a new sentence. In these cases, the meaning is the same, but usually translates closer to 'what's more', 'furthermore', or 'moreover'. Caution As this structure is formal, it will primarily be seen in literature, or heard in speeches."

It is a combination of the adverbial particle は, the conjunction さて 'now' (moving on to a new thing), and the conjunctive form of 置 く 'to place', or 'to leave', 置 き. The more literal 'now putting aside (A)' may also be used. This structure will be used when (A) is a topic that the speaker would like to move away from, in order to discuss something more important. はさておき will primarily directly follow nouns. However, it is also common to see はさておき following a phrase that ends with かどうか. This can be translated as 'disregarding whether it is (A) or not, (B)', and will imply that (B) is a more appropriate topic, so (A) should be moved on from. Caution さて may occasionally appear in either of the kanji forms 扨 , or 扠 . However, this is quite rare. 置 く itself may also be replaced with 措 く 'to set aside'. Fun Fact 冗談 はさておき is a set expression that has the meaning of 'jokes aside', or 'moving on to the serious business'."

As this grammar point will be used adverbially, it will primarily appear at the beginning of sentences. In sentences that do not include other speculative grammar patterns such as だろうか, 果 たして will regularly be translated as 'sure enough', or 'as expected'. Fun-fact Coming from the base meaning of 果 たす 'to come to fruition', 果 たして can be thought of as similar to 'in the end' in almost all cases, as it merely expresses the speakers thought process about 'what will' or 'what has' happened 'in the end'. If using this translation to memorize 果 たして , it should also be noted that the nuance of what happens 'in the end' is almost always something that the speaker either expected, or assumed would happen in the first place."

Due to this combination, the more literal meaning is 'going ahead with (A) as an exception', and just declares that (A) is something that is being completely disregarded before discussing the main point. As は is simply marking the topic in the same way that it usually does, this phrase may be seen after a noun, or any other word that would usually be grouped with は. This frequently includes things like かどうか. It is also fairly common to see the (A) word repeated in both its positive and negated form. This has the nuance of 'whether or not', in the same way as かどうか. Despite this grammar structure being used to essentially remove (A) from what is being discussed, the primary reason for this is that (A) is usually an exception to some particular rule or constant that the speaker wants to highlight. Caution は 別 として may occasionally be replaced by は 別 にして , with little change in overall nuance. The use of と merely sounds more definitive, while に expresses that the speaker is intentionally separating (A)."

This expression will only appear with nouns, or な-Adjectives in their 語幹 (stem form). (A) は (B) となっている is often translated as '(A) happens to be (B)', '(A) has been established as (B)', or 'it has been decided that (A) is (B)'. Let's have a look at some examples, and then how this structure is formed. Despite the different translations, (A) は (B) となっている always has the same meaning, which can be understood as follows: (A) は - (A) is a constant unchanging thing. (B) と - (B) is a result. (coming from the case marking particle と's role in highlighting results.) なっている - (A) is existing in the state 'having arrived at the result of (B)'. Due to this, the literal translation may be thought of as 'it is now that (A) is (B)' in almost all situations. Caution (A) は (B) となっている may be rephrased to (A) は (B) になっている. However, に will remove much of the feeling of a 'result', or 'finality'. Due to this, it will just sound like (A) is becoming (B), but is not necessarily that way yet. Caution In writing, おる is not always considered a 'formal' equivalent of いる, especially in set phrases. となっている is often seen as となっており, instead of となっていて. This is particularly common in news articles."

This translates as 'It'd be good if (A)'. To use ばいい, add the conjunction particle ば, to the end of any verb, and then attach the い-Adjective , いい . Although ばいい literally means 'if (A), it's good', it can also be used to give advice, and has a meaning that is similar to 'should (A)' in these situations. It is generally quite a soft way of giving advice. Caution ばいい may also be used when making statements about something that the speaker believes is not possible. In these cases, it is regularly paired with のに , and has the nuance of 'despite it being good if it were (A)'. This shows that the speaker thinks that (A) would be good, but is aware that (A) cannot/will not happen for some reason."

This is when ばかり appears directly before the sentence conjunction point, and other combinations are possible (such as ばかりだから). It should be noted that the で with ばかり here is not the particle で, but the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb, だ .

                        "content": "There are several different ways to express 'if' in Japanese. One of these is through using the conjunction particle ば . ば presents hypothetical situations (possibilities), and pairs with verbs using an う to え sound-change conjugation method on the terminal (last) kana. Let's examine this with a few verbs first. As we can see with these verbs, the final kana will change to an え sound, from its original う (る to れ, う to え, く to け, す to せ, etc.) before adding ば . It is important to practice these, to not get them mixed up with verbs that use れる , and られる . Unlike with these verbs, the base form of する and くる will not change when using ば . To conjugate い-Adjectives with ば , the い will be replaced with けれ, one of the standard い-Adjective conjugation forms. After this, just add ば . For な-Adjectives , and nouns, なら (another standard conjugation form of these words) will be added, before attaching ば . In the negative form (using ない), both the auxiliary verb ない, and the い-Adjective ない will conjugate in the same way. Simply replace い with けれ, and then add ば . Fun Fact The なら in ならば is often used by itself to mean 'if', and is an abbreviation of the classical auxiliary verb なり 'to be'. In its hypothesis form, なり will become ならば . However, なり is very irregularly used by itself in modern Japanese, with なら , and ならば being far more common. Caution So that you do not mix up the conjugation rules for ば , and passive verbs, remember that the last kana of the verb will change to an あ sound, before adding れる with passive verbs. However, this change is to an え sound with ば ."

This construction comes from a combination of the noun 振 り 'a shake', the adverbial particle を , and する . It can be thought of as meaning 'to give off the impression of (A)', or 'to shake off the impression of (A)'. As ふり itself is a noun, this expression may be used with the attributive form of any other word. Fun Fact The noun 振 り has several different nuances in Japanese, with only one of them being used in this particular expression. That meaning is 'to show a certain behavior pattern on the outside'. Due to this, ふり doesn't specifically mean 'to pretend', just that what is happening on the outside may be different to what is happening within a person (either mentally or physically)."

In this way, we can see that the literal meaning of 'ought not (A)' exhibits some sort of moral or logical obligation, as is true for all uses of べき derived patterns. べからず and べからざる will be seen following verbs in their dictionary forms . べからざる will be followed by a noun, indicating that the noun is being modified by the phrase. In modern Japanese, the meanings of both of these grammar patterns have shifted slightly from 'obligation', to simply having a strong nuance of 'don't (A)'. In addition to this, they will almost only ever be used on signs or notices. Caution The べからざる form that combines with nouns is usually only seen in a few set variations. These are 許 す べからざる 'cannot be forgiven', ありう べからざる 'must not exist' (impossible), and 欠 く べからざる 'must not be without'."

This phrase can be translated as 'it isn't like (A)', 'it's not to the point of (A)'. Literally it means 'if (A) is the extent, then (B) is not true'. ほど will regularly be used after a verb or noun, while ない is more likely to be used after a verb, い-Adjective , or な-Adjective (as it is describing something about ほど). While this grammar point may be used for expressing that an extent has not been reached, it is also frequently used for making comparisons between two things. In these cases, it states that 'the example/limit of (A) is something that cannot be reached/repeated by (B)'. This is similar to '(B) is not as ~ as (A)' in English."

It is often translated as 'let's (A)', or 'shall we (A)?'. To use ましょう , we will simply need to change ます to ましょう , when conjugating the verb. Despite regularly being translated as 'shall we (A)?', ましょう does not specifically target another person, and can also be used as a declaration that (A) will be done/needs to be done. This use reflects the base meaning of ましょう , which is the polite volitional form (deliberately/purposefully doing something). In this example, the speaker is expressing to themselves that they 'will' do something, and are strongly resolved to make it happen (similar to 'I shall' in English)."

This expression is a little bit different to ましょうか , in that it sounds directly like an invitation to do (A). ましょうか tends to sound more like a suggestion that (A) should be done. It is recommended to use the ませんか version, as ないか would be a bit too casual to use with someone that you are not very close with (and is also technically not correct Japanese). To make it clearer that the speaker wants to do (A) 'with' someone, expressions like 一緒 に 'together' are often added, for clarification. To examine the difference between ましょうか and ませんか , let's have a look at how the nuance changes in the same type of sentence. Here, ませんか will come across as an invitation due to the fact that you are asking the person if they 'wouldn't mind doing (A)' with you. This is the main reason that it is considered a more polite option when inviting someone to do something, than ましょうか ."

The adverbial particle まで , and the case marking particle に . までに is verb similar to まで when it means 'until'. However, there is one very important distinction. This distinction is that までに means 'by', not 'until'. To use までに , we will need to attach it to the end of a noun, or verb in the non-past form. To understand the difference between まで , and までに , we need to remember that に usually marks a 'target', or a 'destination' for where something will happen. In this case, まで is the 'target' that に is marking. This is due to the fact that まで means 'as far as' ( まで is sometimes written using kanji 迄 , especially in older/formal texts, and newspapers). In this way, までに more literally means '(A) as far as ( に marks the target), (B). Fun Fact Originally, まで meant 'as far as' in regard to the passing of a particular event. However, in modern Japanese, most people will assume that the speaker means 'by the beginning of (A)'. Due to this, sentences that have a very broad event, such as 夏 までに could actually be interpreted as 'by the start of summer', or 'before the end of summer', depending on who you are talking to. In these cases, it would be better to add a more specific time frame."

However, when used with verbs, it has a tendency to be used with the た (past) form most frequently. まま often expresses that something should be left alone, or undisturbed. This is generally seen with verbs in the ない form. Caution While まま may be followed by the case marking particle に , it is very often omitted. When it appears, however, it will place extra emphasis on the next verb in the sentence. Fun Fact まま may sometimes be pronounced as まんま . However, this variation is primarily only used in casual speech, or writing that is being made to sound like casual speech."

The 語幹 (stem form) being the form with い removed (for い-Adjectives ), or な removed (for な-Adjectives ). Caution み's differences from ~ness are as follows. み is used to highlight the 'condition', or 'place' in which something exists in a constant state. Therefore, it will not be used to highlight varying degrees of ~ness, only innate qualities that are not being specifically measured. In addition to this, み is sometimes used directly as a substitute for 味 , the kanji meaning 'taste'. In these cases, み tends to describe a quality of something that can be sensed (such as taste or color)."

(Negative) - Although expected to still be going, it isn't. 'Anymore', in English. This is the opposite of まだ , which means 'something is unexpectedly still going'. もう may also be used to ask questions. This is when the speaker thinks that something 'might' have ended, but wants to confirm. Fun Fact もう is often used simply as an expression of exasperation (giving up on arguing), to show that someone has already reached the point of not wanting to continue."

Often, ものがある is translated as 'I feel strongly that (A)', or 'there is something (A) about (B)'. The latter meaning is very close to the literal translation here, as もの 'thing', がある 'there is' implies that the speaker strongly senses the presence of (A) within (B), even if they themselves cannot figure out why they feel that way. ものがある is primarily seen following verbs in either their dictionary or negated forms, い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives followed by な. As ものがある emphasizes the existence of (A) within (B), it is very common for the emphasized には to also be used in place of に when highlighting the topic. Caution Although 'I feel strongly that (A)' is a common interpretation of ものがある , it is important to remember that the actual thing that is generating that feeling within the speaker may either be very strong, or very weak. In other words, ものがある may be used even when something isn't obvious about (A), so long as the speaker themselves feel strongly about it. Fun-fact 目 を 見張 るものがある is a set phrase that is a combination of 目 を 見張 る 'to be astonished', and ものがある . In most cases, this expression just means that (B) is extremely surprising or impressive."

However, it may also occasionally appear after い-Adjectives. Caution Unlike として by itself, which indicates that something is being viewed as (A) because it is in fact (A), ものとして makes use of もの to take away a certain degree of definiteness about the identity of (A). Basically, this means that もの is being marked as the ‘thing’ that is true by として, while the word that もの follows may or may not be true, but is being assumed as true by the speaker.

This grammar pattern expresses that while (A) is not thought to be possible, if it were possible, (B). Common translations include 'if (A), (B)', if one could (A), (B)', and 'if (A) were possible, (B)'. As ものなら is just a combination of もの and the hypothetical form of だ (なら), ものなら simply states that if (A) were a 'thing', then (B). Due to ものなら regularly expressing a desired outcome in the (B) part of sentences, this grammar structure will usually be accompanied by てみる or てみたい. Additionally, もし may also appear at the beginning of the sentence to further increase the nuance of 'if'. てみる is often used for criticism, suggesting that if someone thinks that (A) were possible, then perhaps they should try it. てみたい on the other hand is more commonly seen when (A) is wished for, and the speaker would like to do it if possible. While not a strict rule, the verb in both the (A) and (B) parts of ものなら sentences is frequently the same. Especially when expressing a desire to do (A)."

In these cases, it adds a small amount of emotion to a statement, and presents it as a reason. Due to this, もの is usually translated as 'because', or 'cause'. Literally, it just means 'it's an (A) thing!'. もの is quite casual, so should be avoided in formal situations. To use もの as 'because', attach it to the end of the plain form of any word. To emphasize もの even further, the explanatory んだ (after a verb or い-Adjective ), or なんだ (after a な-Adjective or noun) will often be used. Caution もの can be shortened to もん in its use as a sentence ending particle. However, this makes the statement sound far more 'cute' or 'childish'. Due to this, it should be avoided in standard conversation. Fun Fact Although it is not used regularly in standard Japanese, ん です もの is a slightly more polite version of んだもの that appears frequently in anime, manga, and novels."

As you can see here, English requires 'either/neither (when negative)', or 'too/also', but Japanese only requires も . You can think of it as simply meaning 'Whatever is true for (A), is also true for (B)'. も is part of many other compound grammar structures in which it keeps its original meaning, but shifts the nuance a little bit. Some of these include でも , にも～ない , とも . As we can see, it is frequently paired with other particles! Here, も can be seen pairing with で . This suggests that 'With (A), (B) also'. This is regularly translated simply as 'but' in English, despite the nuance being closer to 'and also'."

To compare how と and や are different, imagine that there is a bowl of fruit. In this bowl there are apples, oranges, and peaches. If と is used to list the apples and oranges, it would give the listener the impression that there are no peaches. This is called an 'exhaustive' list, meaning that all possibilities should be listed. However, if や is used, the listener would know that there are other things in the bowl apart from the apples and oranges. In this way, や is a better choice when you want to say 'and', but don't want to limit the group that you are listing. Caution や cannot be used after verb phrases. This is done with たり , or とか ."

This is a combination of either of the auxiliary verbs う or よう, ではない, and the sentence-ending particle, か. う and よう primarily express will or intent like 'shall' in English. Due to the negation following them, the literal translation will be similar to 'shall we not do (A)?'. For ease of translation, this structure can be remembered as simply 'let's do (A)', or 'why don't we do (A)'. As with all structures that use う or よう, ようではないか will be attached to the end of a verb indicating the action which is being suggested. Alternatively, the abbreviated form of じゃない may be used in place of ではない. Despite this, ようではないか is primarily a formal grammar structure, so will most often use the unabbreviated version, or even more polite ようではありませんか construction. Fun-fact Occasionally, this grammar structure may be seen preceded by もらう. In these cases, it is usually challenging the listener to do something. This can be interpreted as 'why don't I have you do (A) then'."

The standard translation is ‘depending on the way that (A), (B)’. ようによっては will often highlight results that vary greatly from person to person, or from one method to the other. This grammar pattern will appear after the conjunctive form of verbs. Caution This phrase may be simply considered to be a more advanced version of the suffix 方 , which also highlights a ‘way’.

When attaching う to う-Verbs , simply replace the last kana with the equivalent お sound kana from within the same column (く becomes こ, う becomes お, す becomes そ, etc.), before adding う . For る-Verbs , replace る with よう . As with many other verb conjugations, する and くる behave in a slightly different way to regular う-Verbs and る-Verbs . する will become し よう , while くる will become こ よう . The type of statements that う , and よう can be used for in Japanese are usually divided into three categories. 推量 - Expresses guesses (has a similar meaning to だろう , which itself is the よう form of だ ) 意志 - Expresses intentions (has a similar meaning to ～するつもりだ ) 勧誘 - Expresses invitations or encouragement (has a similar meaning to 誘 う 'to invite') Caution Although よう is used with る-Verbs , する , and くる , it should not be confused with ようだ , another auxiliary verb that is used when describing likeness (in a similar way to そうだ )."

However, unlike ほうがいい based expressions, any pair of adjectives, verbs, or nouns may be compared in this construction, so long as のほうが is followed by an adjective. より translates roughly to 'than', or 'rather than' in this phrase. From the examples listed here, we can see that より will always appear after the word that has the lower extent of (A), when used together with のほうが . Caution When より is used by itself, or when it is not linked directly to the previous word, it can seem like it has the opposite meaning. However, in these cases, のほうが just remains unsaid. In this example, because the より is after が , not before これ , it is easy to assume that これ is the thing that is lower. However, this が behaves in the same way as のほうが , meaning that これ itself is the more expensive thing, with より just being used like 'relatively' (compared to many other things). Caution Although の 方 が is the most common construction, the particle を may sometimes replace が. This is especially true when used with markers of desire such as たい and ほしい. The primary difference between these two is that が emphasizes what a person wants or wants to do (the whole statement), while を emphasizes the item or action itself (regardless of the rest of the statement). With たい, both を and が will sound completely natural. However, with ほしい, が will be more natural, while を is accepted. This use of ほしい only applies to wanting items, as opposed to たい, which indicates the desire to 'do' something."

An auxiliary adjective is a type of adjective that must be attached to another word for it to have any meaning. To use らしい in this way, it must be attached to the end of a noun, and will imply that something is 'typical of (A)', where (A) is the noun that comes before it. As this らしい behaves like an い-Adjective , it may also be conjugated to らしく , before a (B) phrase will explain more about 'what' is/was typical of (A). The primary use of this らしい is to express that (A) has some feature or trait that is expected of itself. It can be used for people, 'studying all night is so typical of Tanaka', or it can be used for things like seasons 'this heat is so typical of the Japanese Summer'. Other common translations are 'to be befitting of (A)', or 'to be appropriate for (A)'. However, it may also be used negatively, to show that something is (often surprisingly) 'uncharacteristic of (A)'. Fun Fact When the noun that appears in (A) and (B) are the same, it will imply that (A) is the 'prime example of (B)', or 'the most (A), (B)'."

Despite this, it may be beneficial to consider it almost identical to an equally versatile English word 'so'. In all of its uses, わけ simply highlights the plain existence/determination of something in the same way that 'so' does in English. This can be seen in its most basic form in わけだ . A combination of わけ and the auxiliary verb だ . わけだ will be used at the end of sentences, and is sometimes preceded by という. This use is often translated as 'for the reason of (A)', 'no wonder its (A)', or 'its (A), as you'd expect'. Realistically though, it just means 'it is so that it's (A)', or 'so it's (A)'. Due to わけ being a noun, it will need to follow the attributive form of whatever word comes before it. As we can see 'so' and わけ have an extremely close pattern of nuances, ranging from 'because', all the way through to simple emphasis (like with 'naturally', and 'as you'd expect'). わけ may also be used in questions, implying that the speaker is trying to determine something that they have heard. わけだね 'so its (A) right?', and わけ です か 'so is it that (A)?' are good examples of this."

Fun Fact While 割 に is often thought to make comparisons between things, it actually only ever compares something to itself (or things within the same category). The 'proportion' that is then highlighted is something that is not common within the category of (A). Caution Both 割 と and 割 に are quite common expressions. However, 割 と is used far more often in casual speech to show that something is 'unexpectedly (A)'. It will also frequently be used as a stand-alone expression, appearing directly before the word (usually an adjective) that is of a 'considerable' amount."

In this way, the literal meaning is similar to English phrases like 'setting aside (A), (B)', where (B) will be a broad statement about something that cannot be fulfilled by anything but (A). を 措 いて will follow nouns or noun phrases, and frequently have 他 にない directly after it, emphasizing the point that 'there is no other'. を 措 いて tends to only be used when the speaker positively evaluates (A), and is giving it praise in saying that nothing else can compare to it. Fun Fact As this grammar point regularly appears in hiragana, it may be helpful to remember that this uses 措 く 'to set aside', rather than 置く 'to place'. It may be easy to confuse these meanings, as they are very similar, and are classified as 同訓異字 . These are words that have the same kun-yomi reading, and also have a similar meaning. There are hundreds of examples of these in the language, so memorizing words with the same readings will help in identifying the meaning of new kanji at a later stage."

Its component parts are the adverbial particle を, the noun 余儀 ‘another method’, the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective ない, なく, and the causative form of する, させる. In this way, it literally means ‘to not give another way than to (A)’. を 余儀 なくさせる will be seen following an (A) noun, where (A) is the thing that is unavoidable. Unlike を 余儀 なくされる, in most cases the (A) subject of sentences that use を 余儀 なくさせる will be non-human cause. However, there are exceptions to this. Fun Fact Despite 余儀 and ない being separate words, 余儀 なく is often thought of simply as a single word that means ‘unavoidably’, or ‘inevitably’."

This structure is seen almost exclusively after nouns, but can also follow structures like か, or かどうか that are modifying adjectives. を will mark the 'question' which is 'not being asked'. Occasionally, は will replace を at the beginning of 問わず. This puts further emphasis on contrast, and slightly strengthens the phrase overall. Caution Although を 問 わず may be thought of as similar to 'regardless', there are actually situations where the nuance is closer to 'in any case for (A), (B)'. This is particularly true when (A) is being expressed as a scope. Let's compare を 問 わず to に 関 わらず to see the difference."

In most cases, を 皮切 りに will just be translated as 'starting with (A)', or 'beginning with (A)'. This structure is a combination of the adverbial particle を, the noun 皮切 り 'beginning' or 'outset', and the case-marking particle に. It will appear after nouns or phrases that have been nominalized, before going on to explain how something continued to expand afterwards. In place of に by itself, にして and として are also standard variations of the same grammar pattern. Caution It is rare for を 皮切 りに to be used in relation to natural phenomena, or negative results. What happens as a result of (A) will usually be something positive, and have a specific 'doer'. Fun Fact Although 皮切 り is really only used to mean 'beginning', the kanji combination of 'to cut a hide' can be used as a helpful memory tool for the nuance of creating a starting point from which something expanded outwards over a large area, like skinning an animal."

Together they translate simply as 'but...', although the nuance is actually closer to 'but with (A) as the reason… (B)', while (B) is sometimes left unsaid. This implies that the speaker is looking for a reply, or does not want to say the (B) part of the sentence out of politeness/awkwardness. There are several different forms of this construction that are mostly interchangeable with each other. From most casual, to most formal, they are as follows: んだけど 、 んだけれど 、 んだけれども 、 んだが 、 んですが ん may be replaced with の in any of the above expressions. However, it will again make it slightly more formal. Caution んだが , or simply だが is probably the 'strongest' out of these possibilities, and is considered quite masculine. If you are going to use this form, we recommend making sure that your tone is a bit softer, so that it does not sound too authoritative. Fun Fact ん (or の) may sometimes be omitted completely, but this is not so common in modern Japanese."

Other common translations include 'for the time being', and 'for now'. 一旦 will primarily appear at the beginning of sentences, or directly before a ば, と, or たら modified verb. Fun-fact 一旦 originally comes from the noun 一旦 meaning 'one morning', or 'one brief period'. The 旦 kanji itself signifies 'daybreak' or 'dawn'.

Occasionally, the に may be dropped from this structure, without changing the meaning at all. When it comes to な-Adjectives and nouns, it is also common to see である 上 に used as a conjugation pattern. Caution 上 に must always be used to highlight qualities of things that are equivalent to each other. For example, a good thing and another good thing, or a bad thing and another bad thing."

Due to this, it focuses on (B) being something that will continue non-stop until a change is caused externally. Caution Occasionally, 以来 may also be used to express a specific number of (B) that has occurred since (A).

Fun Fact The kanji 又 and 叉 share an interesting relationship. 又 is used to refer to things that reach a point of separation, but then fold back on themselves (being translated as 'again', or 'in addition'). On the other hand, 叉 refers to things that reach a point of separation, and then split (being translated as 'a fork in the road', or 'crotch')."

It will follow nouns, and may appear as まみれの when linked directly to a second noun that まみれ is modifying. In the vast majority of cases, まみれ will be used in regard to something that is negative, or can be perceived negatively even if it is not physical, like debt or desires. Examples of physically negative things include but are not limited to blood, mud, oil, etc. Fun Fact まみれ is the noun form of the る-Verb 塗 れる, coming from the same kanji and with a similar meaning as 塗 る, 'to paint'. Just like 'to paint', まみれる and まみれ primarily describe something covering the outer surface of another object, rather than its contents."

This particular noun is quite often used as a する verb, in order to convey the level of control someone has over a specific situation. This control may be translated as 'influence', 'impact', 'dictate' or simply 'control'. 左右 する may be used by itself, when describing a whole clause, or it may be followed directly by another noun, to show exactly what is being controlled/influenced. 左右 する is frequently seen in the passive form 左右 される. This is used most often when the noun following される is the thing that is being controlled itself, rather than こと or もの referring back to an earlier statement. Caution 左右 する implies direct (A)'s direct control of (B), and is far stronger than to affect ' 影響 '. Due to this, 左右 may be thought of as being closer to 'to dominate' in English. In Japanese though, the most basic description is 思 う ままに 動 かす 'to move exactly as one wishes'."

When attached to the conjunctive form of verbs, it takes on the nuance of 'for (A) to be possible', or 'able to (A)'.

Compared to できない, meaning that the potential to do something does not exist, 得 ない means something closer to 'there is no possibility that (A) can be done', or 'the possibility to do (A) has not been gained'. Caution 得 る may be seen as either える or うる. The primary difference between the two being that うる is a relatively old form that is often seen only in literature, and almost never spoken. Despite this, うる is never used in the negative form with ない. Fun-fact 得 る is far more formal/bookish than できる. However, there are several set phrases that are very common in daily speech that use this particular grammar point, such as あり 得 る 'possible', and あり 得 ない 'impossible'."

In most cases, 恐 れ carries the meaning of something that innately carries some kind of concern in relation to it, so depending on the context, alternative suitable translations could be 'concern', 'anxiety', 'worry', etc. Fun-fact In addition to がある following 恐 れ, other common combinations are 恐 れを 抱 く 'to carry the fear of (A)', or 'to bear the fear of (A)', and 恐 れが 強 まる 'for the fear of (A) to strengthen', or 'for the fear of (A) to intensify'."

This 'extract' nuance frequently indicates that beyond completion, (A) has been 'overcome', or 'seen through to the bitter end'. The literal meaning of 抜 く can be thought of as being quite close to the English expression 'to pull through', for example, 'despite difficulties, I pulled through in the end'. Let's look at a few examples of where 抜 く will be used. Alternatively, 抜 く may be used in situations where (A) is something that is done to a very deep or substantial degree. This nuance is less like 'to pull through', and closer to 'thoroughly', or simply 'deeply'. This meaning tends to appear with verbs that don't have an obvious end, like 知 る 'to know'. Despite this nuance seeming different, the verb with 抜 く attached to it in these types of sentences is usually considered to have already been done to a 'finished' degree, where there is nothing left beyond that point. With the example of 'to know', it would mean 'to know every single little detail'. Caution - On most occasions, ぬく will be used when there is some hardship or adversity associated with the action. Also, unlike きる , ぬく will almost always be used in relation to human actions. きる on the other hand may be used in relation to either human actions or other events equally as naturally."

As an adverb, it carries the meaning of 'decidedly', or 'assuredly', and is used in sentences that contain ない, in order to convey 'never (A)', 'under no circumstances (A)' or 'by no means (A)'. Like many other adverbs in Japanese, 決 して can appear at the beginning of a sentence, or directly before the word it is modifying (which will be in its ない form). While the translation is 'never', the literal meaning of 決 して is 'decidedly not (A)', or 'assuredly not (A)', simply emphasizing the negative point within a sentence. Caution 決 して may also sometimes be paired with other structures that are not specifically negative, the primary example of this being ものか (a grammar point that we will learn about later). ものか strongly confirms a statement as being something that does not exist/will not be done."

                        "content": "的 is a 接語尾 (suffix) in Japanese that has two primary uses. The first use is very similar to 'as' or 'for' in English, and means 'considering/within the category of (A), (B)'. The second use primarily relates to people, and will be covered later. As a single word, 的 is often likened to adjective endings such as '~ly', '~like', and '~al'. To use 的 , attach it to the end of a noun that you want to express as being the focus point of either a verb or a noun that will come later in the sentence. When describing a noun, 的 will be followed by な (meaning that it becomes a な-Adjective ). When describing a verb, it will be followed by に (making it an adverb). Fun Fact The second common use of 的 is specifically with the names of people, and highlights that (B) is something that is being considered in regard to (A). (A) being the person mentioned. This may be used either positively or negatively. In English, this is similar to 'that's so (A)', or 'just what you'd expect of (A)'. Fun Fact The easiest way to understand and use 的 correctly almost all the time, is by knowing another common suffix , 圏 . Let's look at how these suffixes compare: 圏 - Occurring in the sphere of (A), (B). (B) only happens inside of (A). 的 - Speaking in the sphere of (A), (B). (B) can only be said within the sphere of (A). As we can see here, when you want to convey something that can be said from a specific standpoint, 的 will be a logical choice."

Alternatively, に can be replaced by other case marking particle such as と or の. Each has a slightly different nuance, but are used quite interchangeably. に 関係 がある - Relating to (A). と 関係 がある - Related with (A). の 関係 がある - Having a relation with (A). Naturally, ある may be replaced by ない, to express that the is 'no relation' between (A) and (B). Fun Fact The primary difference between に and と in this grammar pattern is that に highlights the relationship from a single perspective, while と focuses more on how (A) and (B) are related together."

This grammar pattern will be used following verbs in their dictionary form , and will often come at the end of a sentence that uses なら in the first clause. In this way, it will mean 'if (A), then (B) is all that can be done'. (A) will almost always be a negative situation. Examining the standard meaning of the particle まで as signifying an extent, it can be seen that this meaning is kept in までだ, with the speaker expressing that (B) is the extent of what is possible given the negative circumstances brought about by (A)."

The noun specified by の 内 may represent a range or a limit, and is not limited to appearing with numbers. Like の 中 , it may also appear followed by から in place of で. のうち is far less common than のなか when specifying 'amongst', due to this, のなか will be the preferred (more natural) option in speech.

This grammar pattern is simply a mix of the noun 限 り, 'limit', and the auxiliary verb だ, or です in the case of a polite sentence. Therefore, the literal meaning is just that something is 'the limit of (A)', where (A) is some describable feature. 限 りだ will follow adjectives in their standard form s. 限 りだ is a fairly formal grammar point that simply aims to highlight the intensity of traits as perceived by the speaker. As this perception is something coming from the speaker, the adjective itself will often be an emotion that the speaker themselves is experiencing, rather than a direct quality of the object, such as its color or shape. Some examples of this are as follows. 嬉 しい - The feeling of happiness, as experienced by the speaker. 頼 もしい - The feeling of reliability, as experienced by the speaker. 羨 ましい - The feeling of jealousy, as experienced by the speaker. 寂 しい - The feeling of lonliness, as experienced by the speaker. 恥 ずかしい - The feeling of embarrassment, as experienced by the speaker. 心強 い - The feeling of reassurance, as experienced by the speaker. As can be seen in all of the examples. The intensity of the adjective is something that will change depending on one speaker to the next, rather than something that the target is doing."

These sentences will be from the perspective of the person who has 'been made to do' something, and are very often negative (against the will of the speaker). First, verbs must be conjugated in the same way that they would be with せる , or させる . After that simply remove the る, and then add られる . This will create the verb form させられる (linked with る-Verbs ), or せられる (linked with う-Verbs ). As with the causative form, する and 来 る have special conjugation rules. する will be replaced completely by させられる , while 来 る will become 来 させられる . Caution Unlike with causative verbs, where the actual doer of a sentence (marked with が ) is considered to be the person who 'caused' the action, られる reverses the perspective. This makes the doer (marked with が ) the person who is being 'forced' to do something. When the person that is 'causing' the action appears in a causative-passive sentence, they will be marked with に . Caution れる may not be used in place of られる in causative-passive sentences. This is because せる and させる both have せ (an え sound kana) at the point where they will connect with られる . This is a rule for all verbs with an え sound kana at their conjugation point (excluding the 'potential' use of れる and られる )."

The primary reading of both of these kanji is かた, but becomes がた due to 連濁 (sound changes due to conjugation). 型 can be attached directly to the end of nouns, or to い-Adjectives . Occasionally, 型 will be used after the case marking particle の. In these cases, because it is connected to の, and not directly to the noun, it will be read as かた, not がた. Although there are two different kanji that can be used in this expression, 型 will be used far more frequently than 形 . This is primarily due to the base meanings that these kanji have. Those meanings are as follows: 型 - Form (in regard to design, pattern, type, or model). 形 - Shape (in regard to physical shapes only. Square, rectangle, triangle, etc). Due to this, 型 is used when describing any form/pattern that is abstract, while 形 is primarily only used for describing very basic (visible) shapes. Caution Occasionally, 型 may be read as 型 , the 音 読 み (Chinese reading) of 型 . This is primarily when it is paired with other words that also use their 音 読 み, or when it is not acting as a suffix , but part of a set word."

The primary function of this is to form a link between noun (A), and noun (B).

The particle that comes before の will always be something that adds some form of immediate information about noun (A). The most common ones are as follows: Noun (A) から の Noun (B) - The (B) that is 'from' (A). Noun (A) と の Noun (B) - The (B) that is 'grouped with' (A). Noun (A) へ の Noun (B) - The (B) that is 'toward' (A). Noun (A) で の Noun (B) - The (B) that 'done with' (A). Noun (A) まで の Noun (B) - The (B) that is 'until' (A). Caution Because noun (A) is describing noun (B), noun (B) will be considered as the subject of the statement. Due to this, particles that usually mark subjects, topics, or objects of actions cannot be paired directly with の. This includes に, も, は, が, and を ."

Because まで means 'as far as/until the point of', it cannot be used with verbs in past tense, as would usually be the case in English. Due to this, past tense will be made clear by the context of the story, or verbs that come later in the sentence. When used with a place, まで functions similarly to に. This means that someone or something will go 'to' the place, but not go any further. Caution To get a better idea of how まで is used in relation to the past, let's have a look at another example, and how it would translate in English. Here we can see that the English sentence will say 'started', but 始 まる 'start' ( non-past tense ) is required in Japanese. However, later in the sentence, 来 なかった ( past tense ) is used. In this way, the overall meaning stays the same, while being slightly different to what an English native speaker would expect."

                        "content": "One of the functions that the conjunction particle て performs in Japanese is very similar to 'since', or 'due to', in English. Phrases that use this particular (A) て (B) nuance of the て-form primarily express something that is beyond the control of the speaker in the (B) statement. To use this grammar construction, pair the て-form of a verb or い-Adjective with the (B) phrase. In the case of nouns and な-Adjectives , で (the particle) will be used instead. Fun Fact The 'because' nuance of て (or で ) in this grammar construction is primarily influenced by the (B) phrase being something that is uncontrollable, rather than being a different meaning of the particles て , or で themselves. Literally the meaning is closer to the following: (A) て 困 る - Being troubled cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て 嬉 しい - Being happy cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て 大変 - Having a problem cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て びっくり - Being surprised cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て 疲 れている - Being worn-out cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て 心配 - Feeling anxiety cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. Many other words, such as the ones listed above will cause て (or で ) to have a similar nuance. てすみません also uses this meaning of て , as すみません is a feeling that the speaker cannot control, relating to the situation being left unfinished."

When it is partnered with a verb, it has special conjugation rules, depending on whether it is being added to a る-Verb or a う-Verb . In the case of う-Verbs , it also depends on what the preceding kana is. The most common translation in any situation is just 'and' or 'then', due to (B) being highlighted as something that happens/happened after (A). In these examples, we can see that て basically means '(A) て (B)' = '(A) happened, then (B)'. However, this is only when it is linked to another verb. Sometimes the て form appears as で . This is a change that happened throughout the course of history, in order to make sentences flow more smoothly. Despite this, there is no difference in meaning between て and で as a vocal change. The easiest way to identify whether to use て or で is by looking at the preceding kana. If the plain (dictionary) form of the verb finishes in ぐ, ぬ, ぶ, or む, then で will be used. る-Verbs never use で . Caution There are several irregular verbs when it comes to て form conjugation. Let's look at an example of each one. Apart from these 5 verbs, the rules for て form conjugation are 100% consistent."

Unlike English, this form of verbs is able to be used in several cases where conjugation/different constructions would be required in English. In these examples, we can see the three forms of English verbs that are covered by the single non-past form of Japanese verbs. These are verbs ending with -s (sees, hears, goes), verbs requiring will (will see, will hear, will go), and verbs that do not require conjugation (see, hear, go). Due to this one form of verbs covering several different nuances, it is often important to use expressions of time in the sentence, so that the meaning becomes clear. If there is no word distinguishing 'time' in the sentence, the nuance will be that of stating a general fact about something that is true at any time. From all of these examples, we can see that the non-past form can be thought of as expressing one of three basic ideas. General facts, habits, or future events. Caution In books, the non-past form will regularly be used for events that are happening 'in the moment', but without any time word being used. In these cases it is usually obvious from context that it is happening then and there."
