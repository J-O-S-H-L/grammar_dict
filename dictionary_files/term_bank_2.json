Alternatively, あげく may be used to express some sort of troublesome or negative process that led to the conclusion of (B). In these cases, the outcome itself may not be undesirable, but arriving at that result of (B) somehow was. Caution あげく will most often be in hiragana, but the forms 挙句 and 挙 げ 句 are also quite common. Fun-fact 挙句 originally referred to the final line of a 連歌 (a form of early Japanese poetry), and literally means 'the tying up phrase', or 'the concluding phrase'."

When these words are linked, they form an adverbial phrase which is used to express 'after', or 'later'. As with で 's standard meaning of 'with', あとで is simply highlighting that something will happen, 'with' the 'after/behind' part of something. To use あとで , attach it to the end of any past-tense verb, noun followed by の , or verb followed by のは (nominalization). Fun Fact The reason that 後 is translated as both 'after', and 'behind', is because sequences of events in Japanese behave similarly to a train. When the head of the train (one action) passes a specific point, there are still potentially many carriages (other actions) coming 'after', or 'behind' it. 後 で may also be used to alter the meaning of an entire phrase, by appearing at the front. This nuance is just that (A) will happen (at some point) after now."

To use あまり, you will need to attach it to the end of the following structures. A verb, an い-Adjective (that has been turned into a noun through the use of さ or み) followed by の, a な-Adjective followed by な, or a noun followed by の. Then, after あまり, a (B) phrase will highlight what the negative result was. Caution The tense of the overall sentence will be dependent on the first clause. Therefore, it is common to see the verb before あまり being used in several different tenses."

Fun-fact Coming mainly from the inclusion か, this grammar pattern often carries the nuance of surprise.

This is a combination of the adverbial particle も and the adverb 何 ともない 'doesn't amount to anything'. なんともない is often grouped with other negative structures in order to show that the thing it is linked to is not a large amount or considerable extent. In many cases, 何 ともない illustrates that the extent of the thing that it follows is not sufficient to cause a problem. Because of this ～くもなんともない will often be used in sentences where (A) is something that could potentially be an issue, but the speaker is expressing that it has not reached that point, or does not go that far. Because of this, ～くもなんともない is frequently used with adjectives that describe sensations or emotions. Caution This structure is also commonly used with the auxiliary adjective たい, for showing that someone 'doesn't want to do (A)'."

As mentioned, all い-Adjectives end in い in their base form. However, not all words ending in い are い-Adjectives . Let's take a look at some of the words that are commonly mistaken for い-Adjectives . In addition to きらい above, there is also きれい. きれい actually comes from the kanji structure 綺麗 , with い being part of the kanji itself. This is never the case with い-Adjectives , where the い will always be outside of the kanji. Due to the kanji for 綺麗 being somewhat difficult, this word is often written in hiragana or katakana, which leads to confusion for learners. Unfortunately there is no rule for distinguishing which words ending in い are not い-Adjectives , but thankfully, there are not very many of them, so it won't be long before you become familiar with them. Caution Unlike な-Adjectives , い-Adjectives must never be followed by だ . This is due to だ only being able to conjugate with nouns (which な-Adjectives originally are). Instead, です is used with い-Adjectives to make them sound more polite. Fun Fact Although using です with い-Adjectives is very common, it is actually incorrect Japanese. As です is simply a polite variation of だ , it follows all of the same conjugation rules as だ . This means that it should only be attached to nouns and な-Adjectives . However, as most Japanese natives do not know this rule, it is widely considered natural to use."

                        "content": "置 きに  is  a combination of 置 き, a suffix meaning 'opening' or 'interval', and the case marking particle に. Primarily written without kanji, it is an expression used to show that something happens 'every (A)', or 'at intervals of (A)'. The difference between something being interpreted as 'every', or 'at intervals of' can be tricky though, so we'll look at both. Due to おきに being a suffix , it will be attached to the end of numbers, counters, or any 'space' that it is highlighting as being an 'opening' or 'interval'. Looking at these sentences, we can see that the 'interval' is a bit difficult to understand even in English. However, the easier way to think of おきに in this sense is 'leaving a space of (A), (B)'. So if we say 'leaving a space of two days, (B)', it becomes a bit clearer that something is happening during the third day. Caution It is very common to get ごとに and おきに mixed up. The former literally means 'every'. However, the latter having the meaning of 'at intervals' makes things confusing. おきに itself will only mean 'every' sometimes. Let's look at some examples of when these two expressions overlap in meaning, and when they do not. Large time frames or distances - Only ごとに will be used to express 'every'. It makes sense to ask 'at what point' during a day, a week, or a month. Due to this, only おきに will mean 'after the interval of (A)', while ごとに means 'every'. Small time frames or distances - Both ごとに and おきに may be used to express 'every'. It doesn't make sense to care about 'at what point' during seconds, minutes, or hours. Here, because おきに points at the interval, it will mean 'every interval of one second' etc, because nobody is going to ask 'when did (B) happen during the next second', so the space is just assumed to be 'one second'. In summary, おきに will mean 'every (A)' for seconds, minutes, hours, millimeters, centimeters, and kilometers. But it will mean 'with spaces of' for almost anything bigger than that. This is not an exception to the rule, it is just a change of focus as spaces get larger. We can just remember that おきに always has one job. It highlights that (B) occurs after or outside of (A). While ごとに highlights (B) happening within (A). 一秒 おきに - The space is 'one second', so if おきに points to the beginning of the next second, the space is still only 'one second'. Because おきに doesn't care about where (B) happens within that next second, we assume straight away. 五年 おきに - The space is 'five years', so if おきに points to the beginning of the next year, the space becomes 'six years', because we are going to want to know where (B) happens within that next year. It would be strange to assume someone is waiting for New Year of the sixth year to do something instantly. Fun Fact This is a topic that native speakers frequently get wrong themselves, so don't worry if it takes a while to understand! If you are unsure about which one to use, think of 置 きに as 'leaving intervals of (A), (B)' for most purposes. 一時間 tends to be the upper limit of time that most people disagree about whether the meaning is 'every hour', or 'every second hour'. This makes sense, as the time frame is short, but still sort of long, so whether someone takes it as the beginning of the hour or some point during that hour being the important information, their opinions may differ. Remember though, おきに itself only ever points to the beginning of the space after (A), it doesn't care when/where (B) happens afterward."

In this lesson, we will focus on actions that are 'ending'. To say that (A) is ending/finishing, we will need to attach おわる to the ます stem of almost any verb. Whether you use the hiragana form, or the kanji form does not matter, as there will be no change in nuance. Due to おわる being a verb itself, the tense can be changed to show that something will end, is ending, or has ended. Caution Unlike はじめる , which uses the transitive form, 終 わる uses the intransitive form of its transitive/intransitive pair. This is due to most actions in Japanese being considered to be things that 'come to an end' naturally (intransitive), rather than forcefully (transitive). However, there are exceptions to this, and 終 える (the transitive version) may also be seen used as an auxiliary to other verbs."

Naturally, due to being a polite sentence pattern, お～ 願 う will almost always appear in it's ます-form, お～ 願 います . Interestingly, words of western origin, such as katakana loanwords, will often omit both お and ご , appearing simply with 願 う attached to the end.

The first is used in conjunction with 'why' and 'how' words, while the other is used with 'who', 'when', 'where', 'which' or 'what'. We will focus on the latter in this lesson. かというと is a combination of the case marking particle か in its use as a question marker, the case marking particle と in its citation use, the う - Verb 言 う 'to say', and the case marking particle と in its result use. This is quite a few particles combined together, but the literal meaning is more simply 'if (A) were to be asked', before the speaker will go on to highlight their reasoning in (B). 何 で, 何 , どちら, 誰 , どの, and similar words often appear as the 'who', 'where', or 'which' words in these sentences. As ～かというと will come before some sort of explanation, から will also regularly be used at the end of the sentence as 'because', emphasizing the speaker's reasoning. Caution Like other grammar points that utilize the 'if' nuance of と , ば , and sometimes even たら may be used. However, たら will appear far less frequently than と or ば ."

As it is a sentence ending particle , かな can be added to the end of almost any sentence. Combining the meanings か and な, we can see where かな gets its original meaning. か presents questions (usually to other people), while な shows that a statement is related purely to the speaker's own thoughts/opinions. In this way, かな expresses that the speaker's own thoughts are being questioned. Fun Fact In the past, かな was thought of as being a fairly feminine way to express 'I wonder', and males tended to use phrases like だろうか to express the same type of statement. However, in modern day Japanese, かな is used by both men and women equally."

Together these can be translated as 'whether (A)'. によって 違 う is made up of the case marking particle に (highlighting a location), the て form of よる (a う - Verb), followed by 違 う 'to differ', (another う - Verb). All together, this can be translated as '(A) depends on (B)'. More accurately though, the meaning is 'whether (A) will differ depending on (B)'. かは is regularly used after an entire phrase, followed by a noun and then によって 違 う . Alternatively, かどうか may be used instead of かは. This changes the nuance from 'whether (A)', to 'whether or not (A)'. When translated directly, かどうか is quite similar to 'whether (A) or however'. Finally, this expression may also be seen without 違 う. In a sentence like this, 'differs' is simply removed, becoming 'whether (A) will depend on (B)'. As conjugation between the verbs is no longer required, によって will become による ."

The literal meaning is 'going from (A), (B)'. This simply highlights that (A) is the only information or method available from which an assessment can be made, so 'going from that information, (B) can be said', or 'going with that method, (B) can be said'. からして will appear directly after the noun which indicates either the method or information from which a judgment will then be made. As からして is partially objective, this just means that the speaker does not have the full information available to say anything with certainty, and is therefore making a guess about (A) based purely on what appears to be true. Due to this, からして sentences often have the nuance of 'from the available piece of information about (A), (B) is likely the whole picture'."

This may translate as 'as long as (A), (B)', 'since (A), (B)', or 'given that (A), (B)'. It is a combination of から , に , and は , and literally means something like 'from within (A), (B)'. からには may follow any word in their standard forms, but occasionally also follows nouns or な-Adjectives that end with である . からには focuses mainly on the determination of the speaker that (A) is something that is the 'base' state (emphasized with には), so going from that point (emphasized with から) is either unavoidable, or the most logical. The second part of the sentence will then make some statement about that determination. This may either be a personal opinion about the situation, or what the speaker intends to do about it. Caution Sometimes, からは may be seen by itself. However, this pattern is relatively more formal, and will not usually be used in spoken language."

Additionally, か～ないかのうちに may be used to highlight relatively short periods of time within which something happens.

Because the things being described in these examples are not considered to be 'alive', ある is the verb that will be used. いる is used for living things. The polite form of ある conjugates as あります . Due to the る changing to り, we can determine that ある is a う-Verb (Godan verb) . However, ある is irregular in that the plain negative form is ない , not あらない. The kanji form of 有 る is quite common, and should be learned as early as possible, to save any confusion while reading. There is no nuance difference between this expression being used with, or without kanji, and is up to the preference of the writer.

Compared to にくい , which can simply imply that something is 'uncomfortable' to do, がたい refers almost exclusively to 困難 であること 'things that involve a high degree of difficulty, distress, or infeasibility'. Due to this, がたい will come across as far stronger than にくい , and may imply that a certain task is almost impossible. Summed up, these nuances basically translate as the following: にくい - Something is difficult based on someone's opinion, experience, or general feeling. がたい - Something is difficult based on the task itself having a high level of difficulty."

Originally, 癖 was used to convey a preference, or the side that someone or something tended to lean toward (due to it being favorable for some reason). When adding the case marking particle に to this, it merely expressed that (A) was the preferable state/location, so (B) not being/not acting in a way appropriate for (A) is less than desirable."

These verbs are くれる , あげる , and もらう . くれる means 'to give' (to you, or someone that is part of your 'in' group). With くれる and あげる , they both function in the regular way you would expect (regarding particles). This means that が will always mark the giver (the person performing the action), and に will mark the recipient (the person that is the 'destination' of the thing that is given). This means that を will be used to mark the 'object' that is given, as is usually the case. The giver/recipient are often omitted from sentences with くれる , as one/both are usually obvious from context, or the sentence may be focussing on the object. As can be seen here, the same nuance is kept, even when things are omitted. Fun Fact What someone considers their 'in' group will be different for each person, but usually consists of members of your family, clubs that you are in, or something similar that has a 'group' atmosphere (that you are a part of). The giver will always be someone that is more distant than the people that are in the 'group'. Caution When we want to say that we (or someone else) gave something to someone that is not in our 'in' group, we will need to use あげる instead."

As can be seen from these examples, just like many other grammatical constructions, だ will be required when using けど after a な-Adjective , or a noun. けど is just a modern (casual) version of けれども . Please see below for a list of the most casual, to the most formal variations. Casual - けど - けども - けれど - けれども - が - Formal. Caution The phrase after けど will often be omitted if it is obvious, or the speaker does not want to say it."

This is a classical verb form that does not have a modern counterpart. However, the hypothetical form has largely replaced the realis form in the manner in conjugates. The verbs that will be seen altered this way are する ‘to do’, なる ‘to become’, and ある ‘to be’. They will respectively become こそすれ , こそなれ, and こそあれ , and are used specifically for emphasis. Common translations include ‘certainly not (B), but (A)’, or ‘even though (B), actually (A)’. The (B) phrase in this grammar point will include a negative statement, and is usually something that the speaker is responding to or correcting about what another person mistakenly thought. こそすれ may attach to either the noun part of する-Verbs, or the conjunctive form of standard verbs. なれ and あれ will be used based on the standard rules of what type of word なる would usually appear with (a noun or adjective), and what type of word ある would usually appear with (a noun). Caution There are cases where the base verb will have been entered in some way, like by having the causative or the passive auxiliary verbs attached to them before the new base will be altered with こそする. So you will need to work out what verb stem is actually being used in any given sentence."

In these situations, it implies that '(A) is also a thing that exists'. Basically this just highlights that (A) is something that needs to be considered (among other things). Caution ことがある differs from たことがある (a phrase commonly paired with the past form of verbs). たことがある highlights a single event in which the (A) verb was completed. However, when the verb is not in past form, it simply implies that there are 'times' when the verb happens, as opposed to a single/specific time."

These are as follows: 願望 や 軽 い 命令 を 表 す - Highlighting a desire or weak command. 感嘆 や 疑問 を 表 す - Highlighting astonishment or doubt. We will focus on the first meaning in this grammar point, as the 'astonishment' nuance is not as commonly used in modern Japanese, and is primarily used only by women. At the end of a sentence, こと will be paired with the dictionary (or ない) form of a verb, to highlight a particular action that either should, or should not occur. It is usually grouped with the auxiliary verb だ , although this is not always the case. This construction is most often translated as 'should/should not (A)', or 'ought to/not (A)'. Caution This use of こと implies a certain level of 'authority', and is therefore regularly used in relation to set rules and expectations (can very frequently be seen on signs in shops/parks, etc). Due to this, it should not be used when giving 'general' advice, especially to people of higher status."

As こと itself is a noun , the verb (or auxiliary verb) that comes before it will need to be in its attributive form . にする is a strong expression, which tends to make the speaker sound like they are fairly resolute in their decision. Caution The する in にする itself may also be seen using ない, to mean that someone has decided 'against' doing something. Due to this, careful attention will need to be paid to the overall structure of the sentence."

It is utilized in a similar way to くらい , but has a few differences. When ごろ is used, it will need to be attached to the end of a noun, or a noun followed by の . The main difference between ころ and くらい is that ころ can be (and often is) used to express a broad point in time, while くらい is limited to expressing timeframes that are more specific. Conversely, ころ will not be used when expressing approximate distances/lengths. The primary reason for this is that ころ expresses a span of something, while くらい expresses an extent. In this way, ころ could also be translated as 'within the span of (A)', while くらい is closer to 'at the point of (A)'. As an easier way to think about it, if we have a one meter ruler, ころ could express anywhere between 1 to 100 centimeters (the span), but くらい can only express somewhere between 90 and 100 centimeters (the extent). Just like with English, if the 'time' expressed is very specific, then either くらい or ころ could be used naturally. This is due to the 'span', and the 'extent' already being something that is a 'precise point' in these cases. Caution The kanji form of 頃 is also very common, so it is worth learning as soon as possible, to save any confusion while reading."

This is often in relation to the feelings or situation of another. Common translations include 'you must be very (A)', 'how (A) you must be', or 'I dare say that (A)'. 'I dare to say that (A)' is probably the closest to the literal meaning of さぞ , as the speaker is empathizing with someone else by trying to imagine the situation from their point of view. As さぞ is an adverb, it will usually appear at the beginning of a sentence, modifying the whole phrase that follows. The phrase following さぞ will often finish with だろう or でしょう. This highlights the speaker's opinion about the situation as being limited by their own knowledge. Caution さぞ comes from the kanji 嘸 , which has two alternative readings, 嘸 や, and 嘸 かし. Both 嘸 や, and 嘸 かし are occasionally used as even further emphasized versions of さぞ . Despite being almost identical in meaning, さぞかし is used more often than さぞや."

These are as follows: 誘 い、 促 し - To invite, incite, or draw attention to something. 驚 き、 当惑 し - The express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment. 話 の 流 れ を 抑 える - To control or keep in check the flow of a conversation. In this lesson, we will be focusing on the second meaning (to express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment). In English, this is used in a very similar way to 'like', 'you know', 'uhh', and other short phrases that are employed when a speaker is searching for the right thing to say, and is filling the silence. This さ may be used in any position within a sentence, simply to create thinking time. The 'confusion' that this さ expresses is not necessarily a bad thing, and is used by many people to simply express that they have not finished talking yet."

In most cases, ざる will be seen attached to verbs that are describing a noun that comes directly after them. Although ざる may be used in place of ない, in modern Japanese it is primarily only seen as part of common expressions or sayings, such as the ざるを 得 ない 'have no choice but to (A)' grammar structure. Caution As with many old-fashioned grammar patterns, ざる will conjugate with the せ stem of する, rather than the more modern し stem. Fun-fact Some dictionaries list ざる as the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb ざり. However, ざり itself is just a contraction of ず and あり 'to be'. Due to this, both variations may be considered as correct, with ず being the underlying origination."

Like しか～ない , the construction used for expressing numbers, when used before a noun, this expression will mean that nothing apart from that one 'thing' exists. Any verb may be used after しか , but it must be in its ない (or ありません) form. Caution When しかない directly follows a verb, the translation is a little bit different, and means that 'nothing apart from (A) can be done'.

In this lesson, we will further explore this usage. Unlike じゃない and ではない (which need to come after a noun or な-Adjective ), じゃないか is able to be attached to the end of almost any phrase, to indicate a question. This is very similar to finishing a sentence with 'isn't it?' in English. When じゃないか is too casual, ではないか will be used instead. Despite being more formal, this may sound a bit stiff at times, so is best only used when politeness is expected."

                        "content": "すぎる is a verb that is used in Japanese to mean 'to exceed', or 'to go past'. It keeps this meaning when it is attached to other words, and creates the Japanese equivalent of saying that something is 'too much'. すぎる can be joined to the ます stem of verbs, the stem form of い-Adjectives (simply remove the い), or the stem form of な-Adjectives (simply remove the な ). With すぎる , the る is regularly omitted, with すぎ being used by itself. This is a casual language pattern, and something you will hear all the time. This variation may be used with any word that すぎる would usually be used with. There are a few rules that you will need to be careful about when using すぎる . The first of these unique rules is using すぎる with ない . When linked to ない , the い changes to さ, creating the structure なさすぎる . This means 'too much not (A)', or more naturally in English 'not enough (A)'. As with regular ない forms, では or じゃ will be required when used after な-Adjectives . In the third example here, we can see that the さ has been omitted. This is technically not correct Japanese, but has become very common among young people, so it still sounds natural. The second unique rule is when using すぎる with いい to mean 'too good'. Because すぎる is used with the stem form of い-Adjectives , you will need to remember that the stem form of いい is not actually い, but よ. This means that よすぎる would be correct, while いすぎる is not. Caution Because すぎる itself is a verb, it can also appear in the negative form, this confuses a lot of learners, and is something that needs to be practiced. Let's have a look at all of the ways that すぎる could possibly appear with ない . Because the meaning is different in each one of these sentences, depending on where the ない is, and how many ない 's there are, you may need to be careful while reading these, until it starts to feel natural."

The primary difference between it and も is that すら tends to present far more extreme examples to which a specific rule applies, and therefore also applies to all other less extreme examples. In most cases すら will be used with a negative nuance. As すら is an adverbial particle, it will be seen directly after nouns, or nouns followed by case-marking particles. すら may also be followed by も in order to emphasize the point even further. Caution すら and さえ are relatively similar in terms of strength. However, すら is more formal and cannot be used in the さえ～ば construction. すら also tends to be the most extreme example from within a large group, while さえ places more emphasis on a specific individual. Fun Fact は, も, さえ, and すら are all adverbial particles that share a linear relationship in regards to the way that they are used. This relationship refers to the intensity of how (A) fits into a group. This can be imagined as follows. (A) は - (A) is as expected, and there is nothing surprising about it. (A) も - (A) also fits the category of the main topic (は), but may or may not be surprising. (A) さえ - (A) also fits the category of the main topic (は), but is quite surprising when examined individually. (A) すら - (A) also fits the category of the main topic (は), but is the most extreme example possible, thus implying that anything below that level also applies."

Literally, it can be thought of as meaning 'it will work out without (A)'. As mentioned, ず connects to verbs in the same way as ない, so this structure will be seen after the verbs that they are negating. As the primary element in this grammar point that controls the meaning is 済 む, other negations such as ないですむ , or なしですむ may also be seen. 無 しで functions as a suffix , so may be used directly after nouns, unlike ないで and ずに. In most cases, (A) will be something that is thought of as unpleasant or bothersome, therefore highlighting the speaker's relief that it can be avoided."

It is a combination of the auxiliary verb そう, the adverbial particle も, and the い-Adjective ない. To recap, one of the primary uses of そう is to highlight appearance . Therefore, そうもない literally means 'to not even appear like (A)'. This structure will be used after verbs in their conjunctive form . Caution そうもない is very similar to そうにない. The primary difference being that そうもない is stronger. This is due to も expressing something that is surprising (or for emphasis), while に simply marks a location (or state) within which something does or does not exist. The difference can be understood as follows: (A) そうもない - To not even look like (A), where 'even' emphasizes (A). (A) そうにない - To not be looking like (A), where 'be' marks where (A) is 'not' existing. Caution そうもない is an expression that is very commonly used with potential verbs, in order to convey that the 'possibility' of something cannot be observed. While this translates as 'to not appear as if (A) can be done', realistically it comes across quite strongly, similar to 'to not stand a chance of doing (A)'."

Caution ため is very similar to 'sake' in English, and tends to be used far more frequently when referring to goals/positive outcomes, than it is for negative outcomes. However, it may still occasionally be used in negative circumstances, to highlight their (unfortunate) result. Fun Fact 為 is an exceptionally flexible kanji in Japanese. In addition to ため it is occasionally used for する 'to do', なる 'to become', なす 'to bring about', and つくる 'to make'. The kanji itself means 'to put (something) to use', with heavy emphasis on whatever new state/result will be arrived at afterwards. This meaning can be seen reflected in all of 為 's readings."

These are not officially words themselves, but are abbreviations that come from その ような , この ような , あの ような , and どの ような . To use this casual expression, simply say it directly before the noun that you are describing, or enquiring about. Because these abbreviations originally come from a longer (more formal) variation, that form may also be used in situations where you would like to sound a little bit more polite."

The auxiliary verb た will be added to the verb indicating what you have done, followed by こと - が - ある . Like の , こと is regularly used for nominalization (creating a noun-like phrase). However, の cannot replace こと in this particular grammar pattern. From these examples, we can see that ない (the negative equivalent of ある ) may also be used, when you want to express that you have 'never' done something. Caution Just like English, many set phrases cannot be adjusted in Japanese (in the same way that こと cannot be swapped with の in this expression). Fun Fact In expressions where こと is followed by a verb phrase, の may not be used. When used for nominalization, の is almost always followed by a noun or adjective phrase. Here are some examples."

For い-Adjectives, たって attaches to the conjugative く-form. For nouns and な-Adjectives, た will change to だ, and だって will then be used with the stem noun or adjective. Fun-fact Although たって is widely considered a casual form of ても, it originally stems from たとて, which is a combination of the auxiliary verb た, and the particle とて, which itself is thought to be an old-fashioned abbreviation of と 言 っても. In this way, the modern abbreviation of たって still reflects the original extended nuance of たと 言 っても 'even if (A) is said, (B)'."

It expresses the completion of an (A) action, and then a (B) action that is considered to be the result of (A). It may be hypothetical, or it may be presenting a one-time result of something that happened in the past. To use たら , it will replace た in the simple past form of verbs, い-Adjectives , な-Adjectives , and nouns. Caution Despite appearing to be the past form of the word that it is attached to, たら itself does not actually carry the nuance of 'past'. Other words in the sentence will need to be examined to see whether たら is truly highlighting something from the past, or simply the completion of something (which may or may not happen in the future). Fun Fact Although たら is regularly used to mean 'if', it almost always has a nuance of 'when'. This is due to たら specifically highlighting the following situations: Completion: 完了 - Completion of (A). Materialization: 成立 - Coming to fruition of (A). These meanings are opposed to other 'if' structures like ば , and なら , which focus far more strongly on the hypothetical 'if' meaning."

As with other adverbs that highlight amounts, 大体 can be used to modify entire phrases, or can be used directly before a noun as 大体 の + noun. In a similar way to そもそも, a noun/adverb which means 'in the first place', 大体 can also have this meaning. This nuance is frequently quite obvious, as the rest of the sentence will highlight a desired outcome that unfortunately did not happen. Although these 2 primary uses of 大体 may seem quite different, they are both just expressing what is 'essentially' correct, most common, the original, etc. Fun Fact A common synonym for 大体 is 根本 , a noun which means 'the source', or 'the origin' or something. In this way, 大体 just expresses the way something is, without receiving any alterations (regardless of whether any subsequent alterations are positive or negative). This is where the 'in essence' meaning comes from."

After this, the negative conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb だ (でなく) will create the 'not only' meaning. て is not strictly required as part of this structure, but will help to create a far more natural 'separation' between (A) and (B) when it is used.

This grammar pattern may be seen following verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns. な will be required after な-Adjectives. In the case of nouns and な-Adjectives, it is also possible to see だっただけのことはある when highlighting that some particular result is not surprising. Caution だけのことはある is not used to indicate negative expectations, so will only appear when the overall sentence is a positive evaluation of what was expected of (A)."

It will be paired with negative structures and presents 'minimum' or 'light' examples to which (A) does not apply, and therefore obviously also does not apply to anything greater than (A). It will be translated as 'not even (A), so not (B)', or 'not (B) at all'. だに will be seen following nouns or noun-phrases. Although だに often appears when the (B) part of a sentence is negative, だに itself is not limited to being used this way. When following verbs, and the (B) phrase is not negative, だに simply means 'just'. It is best to keep this in mind, as the core meaning of this adverbial particle will always be to mark the word or phrase before it as an extremely small amount or lower limit. Caution だに is only used in a very limited set of expressions in modern Japanese. Some example of these are 夢 にだに 'even in a dream', 想像 するだに 'even in my imagination', 考 えるだに 'even to consider', 聞 くだに 'even hearing', 微動 だに 'even a quiver'."

Caution While だろう is usually used when the speaker has some sort of information that would support their assertion, it can also be used simply when the speaker 'feels' that something is true. In this kind of sentence that expresses a 'feeling' or 'hunch', だろう comes across as quite low confidence. The speaker's tone of voice will often reveal how confident だろう is."

In this way, it is very similar to the 'again' in 'what is (A) again?' け may only be used after the past form of the auxiliary verbs だ or た. This means that け (should) only be seen as だっけ or たっけ. It is also common to see のだ and んだ utilized to make verb tenses a possibility. Caution Despite the grammar rules related to っけ , the younger generation quite often uses it without the addition of んだ (especially with verbs). While it is important to understand that this is still っけ , it is not a grammatically correct form that may be used in writing (or formal speaking). Fun Fact け will sound equally natural when asking a rhetorical question to yourself, or when directly asking another person about something that you have forgotten."

In all cases, っぽい indicates something that is 'exhibiting characteristics of (A)'. This is most often in reference to the way (A) is acting, or the way (A) looks. In English, っぽい may be translated as '(A)ish', '(A)like', or 'tendency to (A)'. っぽい quite often carries a negative connotation. As っぽい creates い-Adjectives from other words, it may be used with the conjunctive form of verbs, or the 語幹 (stem form) of any other word. Caution As っぽい creates new い-Adjectives , っぽい itself may be conjugated in exactly the same way as regular い-Adjectives . Caution The fundamental meaning of っぽい will change depending on what type of word it is being used with. The general rules are as follows: Verb + っぽい - To have a tendency to do (A). Adjective + っぽい - To exhibit all the signs of being (A). Noun + っぽい - To obviously not be (A), although show signs of being (A). From this, we can see that っぽい is generally based on the opinion of the speaker, rather than the innate qualities of what is being observed. Thus, with verbs, adjectives, and nouns, the speaker feels like (A) is in excess, compared to what would be expected. This 'being in excess of what is normal' in the opinion of the speaker is what creates the negative connotation."

                        "content": "つもり だ (or です ) is a grammar point that can have several meanings in Japanese, but is often translated simply as 'intend to (A)', or 'plan to (A)'. It can be used after the plain (dictionary) form of verbs, or after the ない form. In the last two sentences, there is quite a large difference in nuance, and can be thought of as similar to the difference between 'to intend not to' ない つもり , and 'to have no intention of' つもり は ない in English. The former will mean that (A) is being actively avoided, while the latter will indicate that one simply has no plans to (A). Fun Fact The literal meaning of つもり comes from the verb 積 もる, which means 'to pile up', or 'to load'. Due to this, つもり is regularly used to describe people that are doing something that is out of character for them, meaning that they have 'piled up' whatever feeling was required to act that way. In this example, the nuance of つもり is 'so you're really going to act like you're apologizing?!' However, the literal meaning is closer to 'so you've really piled up enough (nerve) in order to act like that's an apology?!' Caution The は in つもり は ない is interchangeable with が or じゃ (usually では is not used). The difference in nuance is that が gives the impression of being 'uninterested' in (A), while じゃ simply expresses that (A) is not the intended result."

However, that is where the similarities stop. てある may only be used with transitive verbs, and highlights the object itself as being the subject of the sentence (rather than the initial person/thing that performed the action). Because ある is being used, it highlights the object as being inanimate (or unable to undo the action that was performed on it). Due to this, てある is regularly translated as 'to be left (A)', or 'to remain (A)', where (A) is the original verb that somebody performed on the object. が may mark the object in these sentences when the action itself involves some kind of preparation. Examples are as follows: 予約 - Reservation (requires time investment to reserve). 準備 - Preparation (requires time investment to prepare). 録音 - Recording (requires time investment to make the recording). In situations that involve no real preparation (opening a door, for example), を will be preferred when marking the object."

Here we will take a closer look at several of the verbs that will be used with ている , to express 'existing in a state of (A) having been done'. All of these verbs would appear as the past form in English, after the initial thing has 'started', 'come', 'died', or 'gotten angry'. However, this is not the case in Japanese. In Japanese, once something is angry, it exists in the state of being angry, once something has started, it exists in the state of being ongoing, once something dies, it exists in the state of being dead, and so on. Fun Fact One of the easiest ways that you can tell whether a verb will use the ている form, or the past form, is to think about whether it can happen twice. Something cannot 'start' twice, so it will use ている . Something cannot die twice, so it will use ている , etc. This does not work with every verb, but will help with over 90% of the verbs that require this form. Something has fallen and is already on the ground, so it cannot fall again. ている will be used."

Although the literal translation is 'with that which was from (A)', the fact that (B) is ongoing is simply implied. As with てから, this structure will be seen following verbs in their て-form. Although not quite as common, からというもの may be seen following それ, when それ is at the beginning of a new sentence. In these cases, それ will linked to what was stated in the previous sentence. Caution As this phrase implicitly highlights something that has remained ongoing ever since (A), it will not be used when (A) is something that only happened in the very recent past. However, because length of time is subjective, it usually depends on what is considered 'long' based on any specific outcome."

When following verbs and ては, ならない can only mean 'cannot', or 'must not'. Caution As a reminder, in the order from most casual to most formal, てはだめ, てはいけない , and てはならない will often be seen in sentences with no significant difference in meaning. Due to the ならない variant being the most formal, it is also the most likely to be seen in writing or polite speech."

While this is translated as 'to try to (A)', the actual meaning is closer to 'to do (A), and see (whether the result is good or not)'. This grammar construction is usually only used when someone tries something for the first time. As mentioned above, this phrase is also used when suggesting that someone else should try something. In these situations, (A) + てみて , or more formally, (A) + てみてください will be used. Sometimes, in very casual situations, even the て will be dropped, and (A) + てみ will be used by itself. This usually has the nuance of 'come on, just give it a go!' Caution When てみた appears in the past tense, it will imply that the attempt was successful, unless specifically stated otherwise by the speaker. Fun Fact While the kanji for 見 る may be used in this grammar point, it will result in the 'see' meaning being heavily stressed (rather than 'try'). This may cause a misunderstanding on the part of the person listening/reading."

The translation of 'in that case' is most commonly used when one person is making an assumption/drawing a conclusion about something that someone else has just said.

These are particles that behave like a regular 助詞 (in that they appear after the words that they are referencing), but their role is a little bit more specific. でも itself has several uses, and the use that we will examine in this grammar point is called 例示 . Basically this means 'presenting examples'. In English, this results in a translation similar to 'even', or 'or something'. To use this structure, simply attach でも to the end of any noun , or pronoun . When grouped with a standard noun as above, でも is just showing that the noun is an example/suggestion, and that there are other choices/possibilities available. However, when the noun is a word like 誰 , どこ , 何 , or いつ, the translation becomes much closer to English words like 'anyone', 'anywhere', 'anything', or 'anytime'. Fun Fact There is debate among Japanese native speakers about whether でも should be considered its own word, or if it is actually just a combination of the particles で and も (or て and も in the case of verbs, but we will cover that later). As で and も together could be translated as 'even with (A)', it would also be correct to consider it this way. Caution When grouped with 何 , the pronunciation will almost always change to なん. This is purely to make なんでも easier to say."

At its core, it is always used to highlight something that is ' required ' to perform some sort of action. One of these uses relates to places, and translates roughly as 'at', or 'in' in English. In these sentences, the place is considered essential for the action to be performed, or the result of the action to be achieved. This is unlike the particle に , which marks the location itself as being the destination or target of an action. Basically, で means (A) 'place' allows (B) 'action' to occur. While に means (A) 'place' is the target for (B) 'action' occurring. In the first example, we can see that に marks the place that the person exists during an action, but the action itself is not dependent on the place. In the second example, the action is considered dependent on being at that place, as there are possibly no barbeques in other areas."

This phrase is often translated as 'I heard that', or 'it is said that', but literally, it is closer to 'it is that it's ~'. The だ is what gives this expression a high degree of certainty, therefore implying that the speaker has heard the statement elsewhere, and is sure of its validity. ということだ can be added to the end of any phrase that the speaker wants to highlight as being something that is known. ということだ is regularly paired with other expressions that show the 'source' of information, such as によると, or によれば . When ということだ is being used to express hearsay (statements that cannot easily be proven), it can be rephrased as とのことだ. The literal difference between these two phrases is as follows: ということだ - It can be explained that (A) is ~ (more emphasis on the information). とのことだ - The statement of (A) has been applied to ~ (more emphasis on the source that 'applied' the information). Caution ということだ is considered to be more formal than そうだ when reporting information that has been heard from another source. This is primarily due to ということだ expressing something that is thought to be a fact, while そうだ retains the nuance of being something that is a speculation/guess."

As this construction is just a combination of という 'to say', and ふうに 'in a manner', the literal meaning of this expression is similar to 'in a way that would say that (A)'. This simply highlights the speaker's uncertainty about what the actual situation is, and that they are only commenting on appearances. というふうに may be seen directly after verbs, or after nouns expressing the way in which something is being done. The (B) portion of these phrases will then indicate exactly what is being done 'in a way as if to say (A)'. Caution Because という often quotes the entire statement before it, it will be important to remember this when figuring out exactly what というふうに is emphasizing."

These constructions are most commonly used after nouns, in response to something that has already been mentioned in the conversation (usually by someone else). The thing that has already been said is quite often the 'trigger' for someone remembering something, causing them to interject with と 言 えば.

It may be translated as 'not just (A) or (B), but all', or '(A), (B) and everything else'. It is a combination of the case-marking particle と in its quotation use, the negative stem of 言 う, 言 わ, and the literary form of the classical auxiliary verb ぬ, ず. The literal translation is simply 'without saying (A), and without saying (B), (C)'. This 'without saying (A)' just means 'without limiting it to (A)'. This structure will follow both an (A) and a (B) noun before going on to explain what applies to everything. It will be important to remember that both (A) and (B) must be some part of a logical group when using this grammar structure, in order for it to sound natural. For example, the hands and the feet are part of the body, the morning and the afternoon are parts of a day, the chorus and the melody are parts of a song, etc. と 言 わず～と 言 わず is a fairly formal expression, and will rarely be used in everyday speech."

In its kanji form, とおり will be written as 通 り, and literally means 'street', or 'way'. However, it is regularly used to indicate the level of 'sameness' one thing has with another. This 'sameness' meaning appears when とおり is used as a suffix . とおり (or どおり) may be used with verbs or nouns. In the case of verbs, it is common to see it being used after both the plain form, and the simple-past form. Both どおり and のとおり may be used directly after nouns. However, とおり will only be used when the case marking particle の comes between the noun and とおり . While both of these structures may be used interchangeably, どおり is more common, especially in speech. Fun Fact Constructions like 言 った 通 り and その 通 り are used very frequently, simply as a polite way to agree with what has been said by another. In these cases, it translates similarly to 'that's exactly right', or 'that's it!'."

It is used to highlight that (A) was expected, but the unexpected result (B) occurred. It is usually translated as 'however', or 'despite that'. ところが is most often used at the beginning of a new sentence, before highlighting something that is contrary to what was described in the previous sentence. This use of が in Japanese is referred to as 確定 の 逆接 , which basically means 'a contradictory conclusion'. Caution Because ところが highlights a result that is unexpected, it can only be used for things that are beyond the control of the speaker. However, if the speaker is trying to do something, but assumes that their attempt may result in failure, ところが can be used to show that they were unexpectedly successful. Fun Fact Sometimes, ところが is referred to as a conjunction particle itself, disregarding the combination of ところ and が. This is similar to ところで, another conjunction particle that has a slightly different meaning, and is frequently translated as 'by the way'."

(A) will frequently highlight a person or organization in cases where the speaker is making an assumption from that standpoint.

This use of the と particle in Japanese is called a result , and marks when (A) is something that has come to a conclusion, or can be concluded. In this way とみえる literally means 'from the way it appears, one can conclude that it's (A)'. However, this translates a bit more smoothly as 'it can be deduced that (A)', or 'it seems that (A)'. This expression is always used directly after the phrase that it is drawing as a conclusion. However, nouns and な-Adjectives will require だ before とみえる . While this phrase is conjecture (making a guess about something), it usually implies that the speaker has done some sort of research, or has some reason that led them to 'draw (A) as a conclusion'. Due to this, it appears reasonably confident. Fun Fact と always 'sums up' things. As a quotation , it sums up the phrase before it as either something that was said, or thought. As 一緒 'being together', it sums up groups of things that are existing/performing actions mutually. Lastly, as a result , it sums up causes, and then illustrates their effects."

In a broader sense, と simply shows that there is a relationship of 'compilation' between (A) and (B). That relationship could be existing together (translated as ' and '), or performing an action together (translated as ' with '). In this case, we will focus on the 'and' translation. A full description of と as 'with' can be found here . と is required after every noun that it is grouped with. However, the last と in a sentence will often be omitted, if there are several. In this example, we can see that the last noun in the group (pencil) does not require the particle と , although it is considered more correct to have it. In conversation, the last と will almost always be omitted."

Alternatively, どうしても may be used after verbs, following the case marking particle と. This will express that 'if (A) happens, (B) is unavoidable'. Fun Fact As the closest literal meaning of どう in English is 'any', どうしても also translates quite accurately as 'in any case'."

It strongly negates any statement before it, while also emphasizing what comes after it. どころか may be paired with the attributive form of any other word. However, this is not a strict rule, as it can also be seen with the 語幹 stem form of な-Adjectives , and directly attached to nouns. Sentences that use どころか must always have a part (B) that emphasizes some type of far more important information (in the speaker's opinion). Fun Fact As か simply transforms どころ into either a question, or a statement of doubt, the literal translation of どころか is similar to 'it's not even remotely (A)' as a statement, or 'do you honestly think it's (A)!?', when asking a direct question."

This is a combination of ない, こと, に, は, and then something followed by ない in the (B) part of the sentence. Literally, it just means 'within the situation of (A) not being a thing, neither will (B)'. This structure may appear with verbs and い-Adjectives in their ない forms, or nouns followed by でない. In sentences that use ないことには～ない , (A) can be considered the condition for (B) being able to occur or proceed. Caution Occasionally, ないことには will be seen in sentences that do not finish with a word in the negative form. In these cases, ないことには implies that not being in the state of (A) will negatively affect (B). This translates similarly to 'without (A), unfortunately (B)', and often has structures like しまう following (B)."

Additionally, して may be added to the end of に, without any change to the nuance. ながらに is a structure that has many potential translations in English, but the key point to remember is that (B) is something that is being highlighted as happening or existing in same state as (A) in an unchanged state. This doesn't necessarily mean at the same time. For example, in the case of 生 まれながらに, it can be translated as '(B) has existed since birth', but what it really means is that 'while being in the state of (A), (B) is still there'. Caution ながらに tends to only be used with a limited set of words, so it is best not to use it with structures that you have not already seen at some point in the past."

Structures like this are referred to as spoken/colloquial language . These casual variations can come across in a very similar way to words like 'gotta' in English. In these examples, a variety of forms have been used naturally. There is no 'most natural' form, and it will often depend on the speaker as to which they choose. As with almost all grammatical structures, the shortest variations (not including いけない , etc.) are the most casual/used the most often. There are several other ways that these common abbreviations can appear based on region, or even an individual speaker's preference. An example of this is なけりゃ, which is a (very) casual form of なければ . In this example, we can see that some of these less common variations are used specifically by certain genders (in general). なけりゃ itself tends to be used by male speakers, and may be considered a bit rougher than なきゃ , or なくちゃ , which can be used by anybody."

However, it is important to remember that this is actually a double negative, and therefore means 'If (A) is not done, it cannot go', or more simply '(A) cannot not be done'. To make this construction, the auxiliary verb ない will need to be conjugated with ば , creating なければ (if not). After this, いけない (to not be able to go) will be added to the end. As learned in the なきゃ lesson, なければ may be shortened to なきゃ . This structure is frequently used either with or without the added いけない . Caution While いけない (to not be able to go) and ならない (to not become) are quite similar, ならない will rarely be used outside of formal situations, or in writing. Due to this, いけない will be heard much more frequently in speech (when it is not omitted)."

Depending on what the speaker wants to convey, なし is often partnered with the auxiliary verb だ , or its conjunctive form で. なしで will mean '(A) that is without (B)'. When connected directly to another noun, の will be required after なし . Again, this will mean '(A) that is without (B)'. なし does not always need to be connected directly to another noun. Often, it can be used in reference to an event or thing that someone wants to skip, or avoid. In cases like this, it may be paired with the case marking particle に , to show determination to avoid something. Caution 無 し is quite different to 抜 き, another suffix-like structure that is used to convey 'without (A)'. The primary difference is in the original meanings of these words. Having a relationship with ない, なし simply means 'without'. 抜 き comes from the う - Verb 抜 く 'to remove'. Due to this, 抜 き implies the intentional removal of something. Often 抜 き and 無 し are interchangeable, but not always."

While ならでは is usually considered as its own standalone word, it is actually just a combination of the negative- conjunctive form of the the classical copula なり, ならで, with the addition of the adverbial particle は. ならでは will follow nouns, and the sentence will then usually go on to say what the thing is that is unique to (A). As seen in the above examples, ならでは will only be used when something is being evaluated positively. As a result of this, it is very common to see in advertising and slogans. Caution ならでは may be seen directly before the auxiliary verb だ. In these cases, the thing that is unique to (A) will have been expressed earlier in the sentence, or will be obvious from context. Based on the history of ならでは , the structure being the negative- conjunctive form of the copula なり means that it is basically identical in meaning of the more modern でなくては 'if it isn't (A)'."

As a predicate , な-Adjectives can appear by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used at the end of a sentence. It is important to remember that all な-Adjectives can also function as nouns, and therefore tend to sound more like a noun than an adjective, when used as a predicate . When there are no other words apart from the adjective itself, it comes across similarly to 'It's pretty', or 'It's hated', and similar expressions in English. We just have to guess what the 'it' is from context. Caution Unlike い-Adjectives , な-Adjectives change form depending on where they are in the sentence. At the end of a sentence, they will always be followed by だ , or です (except in casual conversation where だ is omitted). However, when used before the word they are describing, they will always be followed by な . Hence the name な-Adjectives . In many sentences, either は or が could be used to mark the word/words that the predicate is describing. Which one sounds more natural will depend on many factors. In general, if you are specifically pointing out something as being different from other things in the same category, が will be used. In this example, が is distinguishing a specific station as having a unique level of dirtiness compared to others. は would sound unnatural in this type of sentence. Fun Fact Most な-Adjectives are words of foreign (Chinese/English) origin."

The particle に indicates a location, while あって is the て-form of the う-Verb ある 'to be'. As such, にあって can be and is often translated simply as 'in the situation of (A)', or 'under the conditions of (A)'. にあって will be used after a noun marking the condition, before the second clause will then go on to explain something remarkable or noteworthy about that situation or circumstance. Occasionally, にあって will be followed by も. This slightly alters the meaning and indicates that despite being in the noteworthy situation of (A), (B) is not being affected in the way that one would expect. Caution Be careful not to get にあって mixed up with the にあって used in sentences like 事故 にあって 'to meet with an accident'. This あって is a conjugation of 遭 う, 'to meet or happen upon (often something negative)', while the あって is this grammar point is simply the て-form of ある."

This grammar pattern may also highlight that (A) is something that the speaker should be cautious about, due to a potential negative outcome.

Literally, it means something close to 'if we go off (A)', and just highlights that the speaker is choosing a particular aspect of (A) to discuss as a possibility. In many cases, the (B) part of にしたら or にすれば expressions will be an opinion about what the speaker expects to be true for (A). にしたら and にすれば are structures that will be used after nouns that identify people or organizations, from which the speaker will then make an assumption about them/it. Although almost identical in meaning, にすれば will be the preferred choice in formal sentences. Caution - にしたら and にすれば are hypothetical grammar structures that make some sort of assumption about (A), they will not be used in regard to oneself, and one's own opinions. This can be thought of as a function of にする itself, in that you can't 'go off' yourself hypothetically, as you already are yourself, and already know your own thoughts."

Caution As opposed to としても , a grammar point that will be covered in another lesson, にしても may introduce new topics ( としても may not). This is due to にしても implying that (A) and (B) exist simultaneously, without the need for (B) to necessarily stem from (A). However, としても will always imply that (B) stems from (A) in some way."

This expression is constructed from に, and the negated form of the る-Verb 過 ぎる, meaning 'to exceed', or 'to be more than'. Due to this, the literal translation of 'to not be more than (A)' reflects the English interpretations closely. にすぎない is slightly formal, but is heard fairly often in day-to-day speech as well. This grammar pattern may be used after verbs in any of their standard forms, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns. にすぎない is often seen paired with structures that will emphasize the phrase even further, such as ただ 'merely' or だけ 'just'. In the case of だけ, it will come between the target word and にすぎない. Also, standard conjugation rules will need to be remembered, such as adding な after a な-Adjective before だけ. Fun-fact にすぎない may occasionally appear in set phrases, such as 氷山 の 一角 にすぎない , which means 'to merely be the tip of the iceberg'."

Fun-fact Despite having several different translations, には can almost always be thought of as simply meaning 'for', as に highlights that (A) is the 'target', while は shows that whatever  happens in (B) is specific to (A), regardless of whatever might be true for another topic."

This construction is regularly used with nouns, to show that something 'appears to be (A)', but it may also be partnered with the auxiliary verbs ようだ or そうだ (in their adverbial forms ように and そうに ) to add a level of uncertainty. In these cases, it sounds closer to 'to seem to be (A)' in English. As with many other ようだ structures, みたい may be used instead. This creates the expression みたい にみえる . While this may appear confusing at first, it just means 'to look like something that could be (A)'. In this way it reinforces the 'guess' that the speaker is making. Caution In grammar constructions like this, kanji will very rarely be used. This is primarily because it will change the way a native speaker perceives the meaning. Many grammar structures are written purely in hiragana, specifically to express that they are a 'set' construction. Adding kanji can lead a reader to assume that the writer is highlighting the kanji's meaning, rather than the more common grammatical meaning."

In these cases, (A) is considered to be the source of some form of information which will be conveyed in the (B) part of the sentence. This expression will be used after nouns, or with verbs that have been paired with ところ (to indicate the 'place' where the information came from). In newspapers and in articles, the more formal によりますと variant can also regularly be seen. However, this structure is not limited to using と, and the same meaning can be conveyed with with によれば . This is just よる in its conjunctive form that pairs with the conjunction particle ば . Caution Although によると and によれば are largely interchangeable, によると will convey a higher level of 'certainty', or 'reliability' in regard to the source of information. Due to this, によると is more likely to be used when referring to legitimate sources (police, news, etc). Fun Fact よる is almost always written in hiragana alone. However, there are several different kanji that can be used to represent this verb. Each of these kanji have slightly different nuances, but they generally all represent the same 'base' meaning. This meaning is that '(B)'s foundation is (A)'. The most common kanji used for よる are as follows: 依 る - (B) depends on (A). 拠 る - (B) extends from (A). 因 る - (B) results from (A). 由 る - (B) is due to (A)."

It may be interpreted as 'before (A), (B)', 'prior to (A), (B)', or 'in preference over (A), (B)'. Despite these several interpretations, the literal meaning of 'standing before (A), (B)' can be useful to remember, as it highlights the importance of (B) as a first step. As 先立 つ is a verb, it may be seen in its dictionary from when followed directly by another noun, or in its て-form when indicating the whole (B) phrase as preceding (A). Additionally, the formal-conjunctive form, 先立 ち will often be used in preference of the て-form, as に 先立 つ is a formal grammar structure. Fun-fact 先立 つ may often be seen paired with 物 , and is a set expression in these cases that translates similarly to 'means' in English. This 'means' refers to the prerequisites required to enable something, and will usually appear in negative sentences, in order to show that one 'does not have the means to do (A)'."

This marks (A) as something that the speaker is 'adhering' their attention to, and translates as 'to pay attention to (A)', 'to be careful of (A)', or 'to watch out for (A)'. This grammar pattern is used after nouns or noun-like phrases, indicating the thing that is being warned about, or that the speaker themselves is being cautious of. Most often, 気 を 付 ける will be used to warn about possible errors that could be made, mistakes, or simply the loss of focus. Due to this, it frequently follows negative verbs as ないよう, highlighting that something should be done in a 'manner' that doesn't result in (A)."

Comparative statements such as から or より frequently come directly after (A), while に 至 るまで will come directly after (B). This marks (B) as the 'extreme' extent. Both (A) and (B) will either be nouns or noun phrases. The 'to reach a climax' meaning of 至 る itself can be used as an indicator that grammar points that use this verb all indicate some kind of exceptionally wide range between (A) and (B).

Depending on the particular nuance that is being used, common translations include 'particularly when (A), (B)', 'those who (A), (B)', and 'only when (A), (B)'.

This adjective will be used in the negative, in order to indicate that something is 'not difficult'. The case-marking particle に at the beginning is limited to following verbs that indicate thinking or conjecture. This structure will only appear with quite a limited number of verbs, with 想像 'to imagine', 予想 'to predict', 察 する 'to infer' or 'to sense', 理解 'to understand', and 推測 'to guess' making up the majority of them. Fun Fact Many words have alternative forms that will be described as (A) の 改 まった 表現 'the reformed version of (A)' in Japanese dictionaries. Although the standard meaning of the る-Verb 改 まる is 'to redo', it can also often be 'to reform' in the sense of making something ceremonious or formal. (A) will usually be the far more common or everyday version of a word, such as with 難 しい in the case of this grammar point."

However, the meaning is the same as the modern なければ  'if not (A)'. ねば connects to verbs in the same way as ない, and will then be followed by the negative form of なる 'to become', ならない. Like なければならない , ねばならない will translate to 'must do (A)', or 'have to do (A)', and is simply a double negative that literally means 'if not (A), it won't be (B)'. This is a formal structure, and will mostly be found in literature. As ね is a form of the literary auxiliary verb ず, the base of する will change to せねば, in the same way it changes to せず in other grammar patterns. Caution Sometimes ならない will be replaced with ならぬ. This has exactly the same meaning and just makes use of the ぬ attributive form of the same auxiliary verb ,  ず. While not changing the meaning at all, the addition of ぬ will make the overall expression sound even more old-fashioned. Fun-fact As with other 'must' double-negative structures, the second part of the ねばならない may sometimes be omitted, resulting in ねば or せねば appearing by itself. This is similar to the modern ないと appearing without いけない following it."

Both will appear in their plain form. In this expression, のが is performing the same function as in the regular のは, and のが constructions. This function is nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun). However, のは cannot be used with this phrase, as が is always required with adjectives.

It can be used to show that something is the opposite of what is expected for (A) (translated as 'despite'), or it can be used to show that something is required for (A) to be realized (translated as 'in order to'). We will focus on the 'in order to' meaning in this lesson. To use のに , simply attach it to the base (non-past) form of a verb that you would like to express as being the 'goal', before following it with the conditions required to meet that goal. Fun Fact Although のに can be translated as 'despite', or 'in order to', it actually has the same meaning in each of these situations. の nominalizes what comes before it (turning it into a noun-phrase), while に converts that new noun-phrase into a 'location', or 'goal'. In this way, のに always means 'to that which is (A), (B)'."

This expression indicates that something is 'not just (A), but also (B)', or 'not only (A), but (B) too'. のみ connects to words in the same way as だけ, so this pattern will be seen following Verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns. Occasionally, のみならず may function as a conjunction, appearing at the beginning of a new sentence. In these cases, the meaning is the same, but usually translates closer to 'what's more', 'furthermore', or 'moreover'.

The more literal 'now putting aside (A)' may also be used. This structure will be used when (A) is a topic that the speaker would like to move away from, in order to discuss something more important. はさておき will primarily directly follow nouns. However, it is also common to see はさておき following a phrase that ends with かどうか. This can be translated as 'disregarding whether it is (A) or not, (B)', and will imply that (B) is a more appropriate topic, so (A) should be moved on from. Caution さて may occasionally appear in either of the kanji forms 扨 , or 扠 . However, this is quite rare. 置 く itself may also be replaced with 措 く 'to set aside'. Fun Fact 冗談 はさておき is a set expression that has the meaning of 'jokes aside', or 'moving on to the serious business'."

In sentences that do not include other speculative grammar patterns such as だろうか, 果 たして will regularly be translated as 'sure enough', or 'as expected'. Fun-fact Coming from the base meaning of 果 たす 'to come to fruition', 果 たして can be thought of as similar to 'in the end' in almost all cases, as it merely expresses the speakers thought process about 'what will' or 'what has' happened 'in the end'. If using this translation to memorize 果 たして , it should also be noted that the nuance of what happens 'in the end' is almost always something that the speaker either expected, or assumed would happen in the first place."

This structure combines は, 別 , a noun meaning 'difference', 'separation', or 'distinction', と, and the て-form of する. Due to this combination, the more literal meaning is 'going ahead with (A) as an exception', and just declares that (A) is something that is being completely disregarded before discussing the main point. As は is simply marking the topic in the same way that it usually does, this phrase may be seen after a noun, or any other word that would usually be grouped with は. This frequently includes things like かどうか. It is also fairly common to see the (A) word repeated in both its positive and negated form. This has the nuance of 'whether or not', in the same way as かどうか. Despite this grammar structure being used to essentially remove (A) from what is being discussed, the primary reason for this is that (A) is usually an exception to some particular rule or constant that the speaker wants to highlight. Caution は 別 として may occasionally be replaced by は 別 にして , with little change in overall nuance. The use of と merely sounds more definitive, while に expresses that the speaker is intentionally separating (A)."

(A) は (B) となっている is often translated as '(A) happens to be (B)', '(A) has been established as (B)', or 'it has been decided that (A) is (B)'. Let's have a look at some examples, and then how this structure is formed. Despite the different translations, (A) は (B) となっている always has the same meaning, which can be understood as follows: (A) は - (A) is a constant unchanging thing. (B) と - (B) is a result. (coming from the case marking particle と's role in highlighting results.) なっている - (A) is existing in the state 'having arrived at the result of (B)'. Due to this, the literal translation may be thought of as 'it is now that (A) is (B)' in almost all situations. Caution (A) は (B) となっている may be rephrased to (A) は (B) になっている. However, に will remove much of the feeling of a 'result', or 'finality'. Due to this, it will just sound like (A) is becoming (B), but is not necessarily that way yet. Caution In writing, おる is not always considered a 'formal' equivalent of いる, especially in set phrases. となっている is often seen as となっており, instead of となっていて. This is particularly common in news articles."

In relation to verbs, てばかり is often followed by いる, as a modified version of the standard ている. However, adding いる is not a requirement, and the same nuance may be conveyed without it. When a sentence consists of a part (A) and a part (B), ばかり will be followed by either で (with verbs or nouns), or いて (only with verbs). This is when ばかり appears directly before the sentence conjunction point, and other combinations are possible (such as ばかりだから). It should be noted that the で with ばかり here is not the particle で, but the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb, だ . Fun Fact ばかり is rarely seen using kanji, but it originally comes from 許 り (sometimes 計 る). This kanji means 'to let off', or 'to let through', and implies that (A) is the only thing that is being 'permitted' in a specific situation."

                        "content": "There are several different ways to express 'if' in Japanese. One of these is through using the conjunction particle ば . ば presents hypothetical situations (possibilities), and pairs with verbs using an う to え sound-change conjugation method on the terminal (last) kana. Let's examine this with a few verbs first. As we can see with these verbs, the final kana will change to an え sound, from its original う (る to れ, う to え, く to け, す to せ, etc.) before adding ば . It is important to practice these, to not get them mixed up with verbs that use れる , and られる . Unlike with these verbs, the base form of する and くる will not change when using ば . To conjugate い-Adjectives with ば , the い will be replaced with けれ, one of the standard い-Adjective conjugation forms. After this, just add ば . For な-Adjectives , and nouns, なら (another standard conjugation form of these words) will be added, before attaching ば . In the negative form (using ない), both the auxiliary verb ない, and the い-Adjective ない will conjugate in the same way. Simply replace い with けれ, and then add ば . Fun Fact The なら in ならば is often used by itself to mean 'if', and is an abbreviation of the classical auxiliary verb なり 'to be'. In its hypothesis form, なり will become ならば . However, なり is very irregularly used by itself in modern Japanese, with なら , and ならば being far more common. Caution So that you do not mix up the conjugation rules for ば , and passive verbs, remember that the last kana of the verb will change to an あ sound, before adding れる with passive verbs. However, this change is to an え sound with ば ."

It can be thought of as meaning 'to give off the impression of (A)', or 'to shake off the impression of (A)'. As ふり itself is a noun, this expression may be used with the attributive form of any other word. Fun Fact The noun 振 り has several different nuances in Japanese, with only one of them being used in this particular expression. That meaning is 'to show a certain behavior pattern on the outside'. Due to this, ふり doesn't specifically mean 'to pretend', just that what is happening on the outside may be different to what is happening within a person (either mentally or physically)."

It is a combination of the helper-conjugation form of the auxiliary verb べし, べから, and the classical auxiliary verb ず 'not'. ざる itself is just the helper-conjugation form of ず, meaning that the nuance remains exactly the same. In this way, we can see that the literal meaning of 'ought not (A)' exhibits some sort of moral or logical obligation, as is true for all uses of べき derived patterns. べからず and べからざる will be seen following verbs in their dictionary forms . べからざる will be followed by a noun, indicating that the noun is being modified by the phrase. In modern Japanese, the meanings of both of these grammar patterns have shifted slightly from 'obligation', to simply having a strong nuance of 'don't (A)'. In addition to this, they will almost only ever be used on signs or notices. Caution The べからざる form that combines with nouns is usually only seen in a few set variations. These are 許 す べからざる 'cannot be forgiven', ありう べからざる 'must not exist' (impossible), and 欠 く べからざる 'must not be without'."

This phrase can be translated as 'it isn't like (A)', 'it's not to the point of (A)'. Literally it means 'if (A) is the extent, then (B) is not true'. ほど will regularly be used after a verb or noun, while ない is more likely to be used after a verb, い-Adjective , or な-Adjective (as it is describing something about ほど). While this grammar point may be used for expressing that an extent has not been reached, it is also frequently used for making comparisons between two things. In these cases, it states that 'the example/limit of (A) is something that cannot be reached/repeated by (B)'. This is similar to '(B) is not as ~ as (A)' in English."

Despite regularly being translated as 'shall we (A)?', ましょう does not specifically target another person, and can also be used as a declaration that (A) will be done/needs to be done. This use reflects the base meaning of ましょう , which is the polite volitional form (deliberately/purposefully doing something).

This expression is a little bit different to ましょうか , in that it sounds directly like an invitation to do (A). ましょうか tends to sound more like a suggestion that (A) should be done. It is recommended to use the ませんか version, as ないか would be a bit too casual to use with someone that you are not very close with (and is also technically not correct Japanese). To make it clearer that the speaker wants to do (A) 'with' someone, expressions like 一緒 に 'together' are often added, for clarification. To examine the difference between ましょうか and ませんか , let's have a look at how the nuance changes in the same type of sentence. Here, ませんか will come across as an invitation due to the fact that you are asking the person if they 'wouldn't mind doing (A)' with you. This is the main reason that it is considered a more polite option when inviting someone to do something, than ましょうか ."

The adverbial particle まで , and the case marking particle に . までに is verb similar to まで when it means 'until'. However, there is one very important distinction. This distinction is that までに means 'by', not 'until'. To use までに , we will need to attach it to the end of a noun, or verb in the non-past form. To understand the difference between まで , and までに , we need to remember that に usually marks a 'target', or a 'destination' for where something will happen. In this case, まで is the 'target' that に is marking. This is due to the fact that まで means 'as far as' ( まで is sometimes written using kanji 迄 , especially in older/formal texts, and newspapers). In this way, までに more literally means '(A) as far as ( に marks the target), (B). Fun Fact Originally, まで meant 'as far as' in regard to the passing of a particular event. However, in modern Japanese, most people will assume that the speaker means 'by the beginning of (A)'. Due to this, sentences that have a very broad event, such as 夏 までに could actually be interpreted as 'by the start of summer', or 'before the end of summer', depending on who you are talking to. In these cases, it would be better to add a more specific time frame."

Caution み's differences from ~ness are as follows. み is used to highlight the 'condition', or 'place' in which something exists in a constant state. Therefore, it will not be used to highlight varying degrees of ~ness, only innate qualities that are not being specifically measured. In addition to this, み is sometimes used directly as a substitute for 味 , the kanji meaning 'taste'.

From these sentences we can see that もう can be translated in each case as the following. (Past) - Although expected to not be done, it is. 'Already', in English. (Negative) - Although expected to still be going, it isn't. 'Anymore', in English. This is the opposite of まだ , which means 'something is unexpectedly still going'. もう may also be used to ask questions. This is when the speaker thinks that something 'might' have ended, but wants to confirm. Fun Fact もう is often used simply as an expression of exasperation (giving up on arguing), to show that someone has already reached the point of not wanting to continue."

Often, ものがある is translated as 'I feel strongly that (A)', or 'there is something (A) about (B)'. The latter meaning is very close to the literal translation here, as もの 'thing', がある 'there is' implies that the speaker strongly senses the presence of (A) within (B), even if they themselves cannot figure out why they feel that way. ものがある is primarily seen following verbs in either their dictionary or negated forms, い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives followed by な. As ものがある emphasizes the existence of (A) within (B), it is very common for the emphasized には to also be used in place of に when highlighting the topic. Caution Although 'I feel strongly that (A)' is a common interpretation of ものがある , it is important to remember that the actual thing that is generating that feeling within the speaker may either be very strong, or very weak. In other words, ものがある may be used even when something isn't obvious about (A), so long as the speaker themselves feel strongly about it. Fun-fact 目 を 見張 るものがある is a set phrase that is a combination of 目 を 見張 る 'to be astonished', and ものがある . In most cases, this expression just means that (B) is extremely surprising or impressive."

In English, this may be interpreted as ‘supposing that (A)’, or ‘on the assumption that (A)’. ものとして will primarily be seen after verbs, and nouns followed by な. However, it may also occasionally appear after い-Adjectives. Caution Unlike として by itself, which indicates that something is being viewed as (A) because it is in fact (A), ものとして makes use of もの to take away a certain degree of definiteness about the identity of (A). Basically, this means that もの is being marked as the ‘thing’ that is true by として, while the word that もの follows may or may not be true, but is being assumed as true by the speaker. Let’s see how として and ものとして compare."

This grammar pattern expresses that while (A) is not thought to be possible, if it were possible, (B).

As ものなら is just a combination of もの and the hypothetical form of だ (なら), ものなら simply states that if (A) were a 'thing', then (B). Due to ものなら regularly expressing a desired outcome in the (B) part of sentences, this grammar structure will usually be accompanied by てみる or てみたい. Additionally, もし may also appear at the beginning of the sentence to further increase the nuance of 'if'. てみる is often used for criticism, suggesting that if someone thinks that (A) were possible, then perhaps they should try it. てみたい on the other hand is more commonly seen when (A) is wished for, and the speaker would like to do it if possible. While not a strict rule, the verb in both the (A) and (B) parts of ものなら sentences is frequently the same. Especially when expressing a desire to do (A)."

In these cases, it adds a small amount of emotion to a statement, and presents it as a reason. Due to this, もの is usually translated as 'because', or 'cause'. Literally, it just means 'it's an (A) thing!'. もの is quite casual, so should be avoided in formal situations. To use もの as 'because', attach it to the end of the plain form of any word. To emphasize もの even further, the explanatory んだ (after a verb or い-Adjective ), or なんだ (after a な-Adjective or noun) will often be used. Caution もの can be shortened to もん in its use as a sentence ending particle. However, this makes the statement sound far more 'cute' or 'childish'. Due to this, it should be avoided in standard conversation. Fun Fact Although it is not used regularly in standard Japanese, ん です もの is a slightly more polite version of んだもの that appears frequently in anime, manga, and novels."

Because of this, ようだ is a much better choice when stating things that are obvious/observable by anyone.

This expression is often translated as 'I think I will (A)', or 'I shall (A)'. It is also close to the casual expression 'I'm gonna (A)'. Remembering that う and よう can have one of three possible meanings in Japanese (as discussed in the よう grammar point), ようと 思 う is usually only used to express one of those three. That 'one' is as follows: 意志 - Expresses intentions (has a similar meaning to ～するつもりだ ）. This expression is also often used with 思 っている . In these cases, it highlights that the intention of the speaker is something that they regularly think, or have been thinking about for some time. 思 っている may also be used when describing the intentions of another person, as discussed in our lesson about と 思 う . Caution Let's be careful to remember the difference between the auxiliary verbs よう , and ようだ . They are different constructions that have different meanings, and behave in unique ways grammatically."

It does this implicitly through the meaning of the kanji 様 'manner of doing'. ようにいのる (or 祈 る in its kanji form) is no different, and will imply that the speaker is praying for (A) to be done/completed. This comes from the meaning of the う-Verb 祈 る itself, which can be translated as 'to pray', or 'to beg'. Despite being able to be used when actually praying, this grammar point is used most often to express a 'hope'. In a similar way to other ように structures, ないように may also be used with 祈 る, to show that someone is praying for something 'not' to happen. Caution However, 'unlike' other ように structures, ように 祈 る will sometimes be shortened to ように by itself. This is especially true after ます. This is the only ように structure that will have the verb that comes after it omitted. Therefore, ように (by itself) will always mean 'to hope for', and should not be confused with ようにする , ようになる , ようにいう , and other similar grammar points. Fun Fact といい is also used to express 'to hope for (A)', or 'to wish for (A)'. However, unlike ように 祈 る , the person that the speaker is praying for with といい will mainly be determined by the use of ね (praying for someone else), or な (praying for themselves)."

This expression is used to highlight that you (or someone else) want someone to do something 'in the way of (A)'. Note that when ように follows a noun, の will be required. Either に or が may mark the thing that the speaker 'wants' to do. It is more common for に to be used to mark people, while が will often mark events/objects. Fun Fact Sometimes が and に will be switched, if either of those particles have already been used somewhere else in a sentence. This is mainly to avoid sounding repetitive, or confusion about what the subject of the sentence is."

When attaching う to う-Verbs , simply replace the last kana with the equivalent お sound kana from within the same column (く becomes こ, う becomes お, す becomes そ, etc.), before adding う . For る-Verbs , replace る with よう . As with many other verb conjugations, する and くる behave in a slightly different way to regular う-Verbs and る-Verbs . する will become し よう , while くる will become こ よう . The type of statements that う , and よう can be used for in Japanese are usually divided into three categories. 推量 - Expresses guesses (has a similar meaning to だろう , which itself is the よう form of だ ) 意志 - Expresses intentions (has a similar meaning to ～するつもりだ ) 勧誘 - Expresses invitations or encouragement (has a similar meaning to 誘 う 'to invite') Caution Although よう is used with る-Verbs , する , and くる , it should not be confused with ようだ , another auxiliary verb that is used when describing likeness (in a similar way to そうだ )."

However, unlike ほうがいい based expressions, any pair of adjectives, verbs, or nouns may be compared in this construction, so long as のほうが is followed by an adjective. より translates roughly to 'than', or 'rather than' in this phrase. From the examples listed here, we can see that より will always appear after the word that has the lower extent of (A), when used together with のほうが . Caution When より is used by itself, or when it is not linked directly to the previous word, it can seem like it has the opposite meaning. However, in these cases, のほうが just remains unsaid. In this example, because the より is after が , not before これ , it is easy to assume that これ is the thing that is lower. However, this が behaves in the same way as のほうが , meaning that これ itself is the more expensive thing, with より just being used like 'relatively' (compared to many other things). Caution Although の 方 が is the most common construction, the particle を may sometimes replace が. This is especially true when used with markers of desire such as たい and ほしい. The primary difference between these two is that が emphasizes what a person wants or wants to do (the whole statement), while を emphasizes the item or action itself (regardless of the rest of the statement). With たい, both を and が will sound completely natural. However, with ほしい, が will be more natural, while を is accepted. This use of ほしい only applies to wanting items, as opposed to たい, which indicates the desire to 'do' something."

An auxiliary adjective is a type of adjective that must be attached to another word for it to have any meaning. To use らしい in this way, it must be attached to the end of a noun, and will imply that something is 'typical of (A)', where (A) is the noun that comes before it. As this らしい behaves like an い-Adjective , it may also be conjugated to らしく , before a (B) phrase will explain more about 'what' is/was typical of (A). The primary use of this らしい is to express that (A) has some feature or trait that is expected of itself. It can be used for people, 'studying all night is so typical of Tanaka', or it can be used for things like seasons 'this heat is so typical of the Japanese Summer'. Other common translations are 'to be befitting of (A)', or 'to be appropriate for (A)'. However, it may also be used negatively, to show that something is (often surprisingly) 'uncharacteristic of (A)'. Fun Fact When the noun that appears in (A) and (B) are the same, it will imply that (A) is the 'prime example of (B)', or 'the most (A), (B)'."

Despite this, it may be beneficial to consider it almost identical to an equally versatile English word 'so'. In all of its uses, わけ simply highlights the plain existence/determination of something in the same way that 'so' does in English. This can be seen in its most basic form in わけだ . A combination of わけ and the auxiliary verb だ . わけだ will be used at the end of sentences, and is sometimes preceded by という. This use is often translated as 'for the reason of (A)', 'no wonder its (A)', or 'its (A), as you'd expect'. Realistically though, it just means 'it is so that it's (A)', or 'so it's (A)'. Due to わけ being a noun, it will need to follow the attributive form of whatever word comes before it. As we can see 'so' and わけ have an extremely close pattern of nuances, ranging from 'because', all the way through to simple emphasis (like with 'naturally', and 'as you'd expect'). わけ may also be used in questions, implying that the speaker is trying to determine something that they have heard. わけだね 'so its (A) right?', and わけ です か 'so is it that (A)?' are good examples of this."

The 'proportion' that is then highlighted is something that is not common within the category of (A). Caution Both 割 と and 割 に are quite common expressions. However, 割 と is used far more often in casual speech to show that something is 'unexpectedly (A)'.

In this way, the literal meaning is similar to English phrases like 'setting aside (A), (B)', where (B) will be a broad statement about something that cannot be fulfilled by anything but (A). を 措 いて will follow nouns or noun phrases, and frequently have 他 にない directly after it, emphasizing the point that 'there is no other'. を 措 いて tends to only be used when the speaker positively evaluates (A), and is giving it praise in saying that nothing else can compare to it. Fun Fact As this grammar point regularly appears in hiragana, it may be helpful to remember that this uses 措 く 'to set aside', rather than 置く 'to place'. It may be easy to confuse these meanings, as they are very similar, and are classified as 同訓異字 . These are words that have the same kun-yomi reading, and also have a similar meaning. There are hundreds of examples of these in the language, so memorizing words with the same readings will help in identifying the meaning of new kanji at a later stage."

This structure is seen almost exclusively after nouns, but can also follow structures like か, or かどうか that are modifying adjectives. を will mark the 'question' which is 'not being asked'. Occasionally, は will replace を at the beginning of 問わず. This puts further emphasis on contrast, and slightly strengthens the phrase overall. Caution Although を 問 わず may be thought of as similar to 'regardless', there are actually situations where the nuance is closer to 'in any case for (A), (B)'. This is particularly true when (A) is being expressed as a scope. Let's compare を 問 わず to に 関 わらず to see the difference."

In most cases, を 皮切 りに will just be translated as 'starting with (A)', or 'beginning with (A)'. This structure is a combination of the adverbial particle を, the noun 皮切 り 'beginning' or 'outset', and the case-marking particle に. It will appear after nouns or phrases that have been nominalized, before going on to explain how something continued to expand afterwards. In place of に by itself, にして and として are also standard variations of the same grammar pattern. Caution It is rare for を 皮切 りに to be used in relation to natural phenomena, or negative results. What happens as a result of (A) will usually be something positive, and have a specific 'doer'. Fun Fact Although 皮切 り is really only used to mean 'beginning', the kanji combination of 'to cut a hide' can be used as a helpful memory tool for the nuance of creating a starting point from which something expanded outwards over a large area, like skinning an animal."

This implies that the speaker is looking for a reply, or does not want to say the (B) part of the sentence out of politeness/awkwardness. There are several different forms of this construction that are mostly interchangeable with each other. From most casual, to most formal, they are as follows: んだけど 、 んだけれど 、 んだけれども 、 んだが 、 んですが ん may be replaced with の in any of the above expressions. However, it will again make it slightly more formal. Caution んだが , or simply だが is probably the 'strongest' out of these possibilities, and is considered quite masculine. If you are going to use this form, we recommend making sure that your tone is a bit softer, so that it does not sound too authoritative. Fun Fact ん (or の) may sometimes be omitted completely, but this is not so common in modern Japanese."

When 一応 is used this way, it frequently highlights that (B) happening is unlikely, but the precautionary measure of (A) might be a good idea to avoid it. This is in contrast to another common use of 一応 which can be translated as 'more or less', or 'for the time being'. However, in both of its uses, it simply indicates the minimum amount of (A) which is fulfilling some requirement."

Other common translations include 'for the time being', and 'for now'. 一旦 will primarily appear at the beginning of sentences, or directly before a ば, と, or たら modified verb. Fun-fact 一旦 originally comes from the noun 一旦 meaning 'one morning', or 'one brief period'. The 旦 kanji itself signifies 'daybreak' or 'dawn'. In this way, it can be a useful memory tool to remember 一旦 as the 'dawning' of some period that will not end until it has run its own natural course."

Instead of も, でも or ても may be used for extra emphasis. Fun Fact The kanji 又 and 叉 share an interesting relationship. 又 is used to refer to things that reach a point of separation, but then fold back on themselves (being translated as 'again', or 'in addition'). On the other hand, 叉 refers to things that reach a point of separation, and then split (being translated as 'a fork in the road', or 'crotch')."

These are as follows: 種類 - Type. (A) is the same type as (B). 関係 - Relationship. (A) shares the same relationship as (B). Caution 同士 is most frequently used to highlight 'people', or 'living things' that share some type of relationship, rather than inanimate objects.

Caution 得 る may be seen as either える or うる. The primary difference between the two being that うる is a relatively old form that is often seen only in literature, and almost never spoken. Despite this, うる is never used in the negative form with ない. Fun-fact 得 る is far more formal/bookish than できる. However, there are several set phrases that are very common in daily speech that use this particular grammar point, such as あり 得 る 'possible', and あり 得 ない 'impossible'."

In most cases, 恐 れ carries the meaning of something that innately carries some kind of concern in relation to it, so depending on the context, alternative suitable translations could be 'concern', 'anxiety', 'worry', etc. Fun-fact In addition to がある following 恐 れ, other common combinations are 恐 れを 抱 く 'to carry the fear of (A)', or 'to bear the fear of (A)', and 恐 れが 強 まる 'for the fear of (A) to strengthen', or 'for the fear of (A) to intensify'."

This 'extract' nuance frequently indicates that beyond completion, (A) has been 'overcome', or 'seen through to the bitter end'. The literal meaning of 抜 く can be thought of as being quite close to the English expression 'to pull through', for example, 'despite difficulties, I pulled through in the end'. Let's look at a few examples of where 抜 く will be used. Alternatively, 抜 く may be used in situations where (A) is something that is done to a very deep or substantial degree. This nuance is less like 'to pull through', and closer to 'thoroughly', or simply 'deeply'. This meaning tends to appear with verbs that don't have an obvious end, like 知 る 'to know'. Despite this nuance seeming different, the verb with 抜 く attached to it in these types of sentences is usually considered to have already been done to a 'finished' degree, where there is nothing left beyond that point. With the example of 'to know', it would mean 'to know every single little detail'. Caution - On most occasions, ぬく will be used when there is some hardship or adversity associated with the action. Also, unlike きる , ぬく will almost always be used in relation to human actions. きる on the other hand may be used in relation to either human actions or other events equally as naturally."

Caution 決 して may also sometimes be paired with other structures that are not specifically negative, the primary example of this being ものか (a grammar point that we will learn about later). ものか strongly confirms a statement as being something that does not exist/will not be done."

                        "content": "的 is a 接語尾 (suffix) in Japanese that has two primary uses. The first use is very similar to 'as' or 'for' in English, and means 'considering/within the category of (A), (B)'. The second use primarily relates to people, and will be covered later. As a single word, 的 is often likened to adjective endings such as '~ly', '~like', and '~al'. To use 的 , attach it to the end of a noun that you want to express as being the focus point of either a verb or a noun that will come later in the sentence. When describing a noun, 的 will be followed by な (meaning that it becomes a な-Adjective ). When describing a verb, it will be followed by に (making it an adverb). Fun Fact The second common use of 的 is specifically with the names of people, and highlights that (B) is something that is being considered in regard to (A). (A) being the person mentioned. This may be used either positively or negatively. In English, this is similar to 'that's so (A)', or 'just what you'd expect of (A)'. Fun Fact The easiest way to understand and use 的 correctly almost all the time, is by knowing another common suffix , 圏 . Let's look at how these suffixes compare: 圏 - Occurring in the sphere of (A), (B). (B) only happens inside of (A). 的 - Speaking in the sphere of (A), (B). (B) can only be said within the sphere of (A). As we can see here, when you want to convey something that can be said from a specific standpoint, 的 will be a logical choice."

In many cases, either (A) or (B) alone could achieve (C), but their combined action will bring about a better result. This structure is a combination of 相 , 'mutual', or 'reciprocal', and the て-form of the う-Verb 俟 つ 'to wait on'. In this pattern, both (A) and (B) will often come before 相 まって , with either of the case-marking particles と or が being used after the nouns. Common translations include '(A) combined with (B) will (C)', or 'coupled together with (A), (B) will (C)'. As for a literal translation, 'mutually depending on each other, (C)' is fairly close to the exact nuance. See the fun-fact for more about this. Fun Fact Although 俟 つ 'to wait on' and 待 つ 'to wait for' are very similar, they have a primary difference in their focus. 待 つ indicates waiting in the sense of 'waiting for (A) to come', while 俟 つ indicates 'waiting for (A) to go'. What this means is that with 相 まって and other uses of 俟 つ, the important thing happens after (A) and (B) come together. This gives the nuance of (A) and (B) having some kind of reliance on each other in order to do (C). Due to 俟 つ being far less common in modern Japanese, it will often be written in hiragana."

This can also often come across as 'no more than (A)', especially in cases where no actual barrier exists, but the speaker cannot imagine that anything higher (or lower) than (A) is possible. As 精々 is an adverb, it often appears at the beginning of sentence, or at the beginning of the second clause of a sentence, before the thing that is thought to be at its maximum is described. Fun-fact 精々 is said to have come from the old-fashioned word 精試 , which meant 'to completely exhaust all of one's good faith'. In modern times, 精々 itself has kept this meaning of 'completely exhausting (A)'. However, this is no longer used in reference to 'good faith', but rather exhausting all of one's 'power', 'mental capacity', or 'power of assumption' in relation to (A)."

The primary meanings are as follows: (A) 込 む - To enter completely into doing (A), or the state of being in (A). (A) 込 む - To enter a state of doing (A) that will not be considered complete until 'success'. (A) 込 む - To enter a state of doing (A) that cannot be escaped from. In this lesson, we will exclusively focus on the first meaning, which is usually translated as 'to put into (A)', or 'to go into (A)'. This form will be attached to the conjunctive form of other verbs. Despite the multiple meanings, 込 む can almost always be thought of as 'jamming (B) into (A)'. This means that whatever the (A) action is, will be something that is not easily entered, but also not easily escaped from."

'The conjunctive form' is much more accurate, as it is used with more than just verbs. Basically, the conjunctive form is the form of any word that will be used in standard conjugation with other structures. For い-Adjectives , this is the form that uses く, for verbs, the ます stem. The reason that conjunctive form is sometimes referred to as 'the formal conjunctive' is due to its use before a comma. Usually, the conjunction particle て would be used to separate clauses in sentences, however, the formal conjunctive allows this to be done without て. Let's look at some examples. As we can see, although て is not required, a 読点 (Japanese comma) will be required to prevent the sentence from becoming confusing. Caution This type of conjugation is seen primarily in formal writing, and the standard て form will be heard much more frequently in daily speech."

Due to this, it is non-exhaustive. なり is a fairly polite construction and will appear after either verbs in their dictionary forms , or nouns that may or may not be followed by another particle. This is in cases where that particle is giving important information involved in the 'choice'. An example of this would be に for marking a location. As with all adverbial particles , なり cannot follow either が or を. Caution This emphasis on (A) なり (B) なり presenting lists from which something will be chosen is what differentiates it from similar structures such as など and や. Due to this, なり will not be used to mean 'such as', but only for 'either, or' statements."

Due to の adding emphasis, this expression will be heard very frequently in explanations. Caution There is no real difference between ん and の . Only の is considered 'correct Japanese', but ん evolved to make things easier to say. ん is the most common form in spoken Japanese, and the use of の could be considered a bit formal, or 'stiff'. While both the だ and です forms are equally as natural, only the です form will be used if adding か to the end ～んです か .

When used with い-Adjectives , ない itself is also an い-Adjective . This means that it follows the same rules as regular い-Adjectives . Due to ません (the polite negative form) being an auxiliary verb ,  it cannot be conjugated with い-Adjectives in the same way as verbs. As can be seen here, you must first add the verb ある , and then conjugate it into its negative form using the auxiliary verb ません. This is how the polite negative is created. Caution As with regular い-Adjectives , you cannot use だ after ない . です is acceptable to create a semi-polite form, but is best used in spoken language only."

The primary function of this is to form a link between noun (A), and noun (B). In each of these cases, noun (B) will be considered to have all of the qualities described by noun (A), and the first particle that follows it. The particle that comes before の will always be something that adds some form of immediate information about noun (A). The most common ones are as follows: Noun (A) から の Noun (B) - The (B) that is 'from' (A). Noun (A) と の Noun (B) - The (B) that is 'grouped with' (A). Noun (A) へ の Noun (B) - The (B) that is 'toward' (A). Noun (A) で の Noun (B) - The (B) that 'done with' (A). Noun (A) まで の Noun (B) - The (B) that is 'until' (A). Caution Because noun (A) is describing noun (B), noun (B) will be considered as the subject of the statement. Due to this, particles that usually mark subjects, topics, or objects of actions cannot be paired directly with の. This includes に, も, は, が, and を ."

Sometimes these terms are simplified even further to 'other-move' (transitive), and 'self-move' (intransitive). Basically, this is the difference between verbs that require an object marked with を (transitive verbs), and those that only require が , to show that the subject itself is moving (intransitive). In Japanese, there are many transitive/intransitive pairs of verbs, and these will need to be memorized. Fun Fact In Japanese, the two ways in which all verbs can be described are an act/motion  ( 動作 ), and an act/motion upon something ( 作用 ). Fun Fact Although they are not traditionally grouped this way, する and なる may also be thought of as a transitive/intransitive pair. This is due to する always implying that something is being controlled (acted upon), while なる always implies that something happens on its own, or cannot be controlled."

Note also that れる and られる themselves behave like standard る-Verbs, so can be conjugated into a variety of different tenses in the same way as a standard verb. A common sight in modern Japanese is words where the ら may be removed, 'ラ 抜 き 言葉 ', and れる may be used by itself. However, this is not technically correct Japanese, and may cause confusion in cases where ら is required (with る-Verbs and くる , when られる is expressing 'passivity', 'respect', or 'spontaneous occurrence'). For う-Verbs , they will behave a little differently. Instead of the final kana of the verb changing to an あ sound, and then adding れる (as would be the case with passive verbs), the final kana of the verb will change to an え sound (る will become れ, う will become え, す will become せ, etc.) before adding る. Interestingly, する verbs do not have a ' potential ' form, and the verb できる will be used in its place. Caution ことができる and られる (when used in its ' potential ' meaning) have exactly the same nuance. However, many people consider ことができる to be slightly more polite. Fun Fact When using the potential form, either を or が may be used to mark the 'object'. You will need to be careful though, as this does not apply to できる , which may only ever use が ."

The た (plain-past), or ている (continuous) form of verbs are usually used. る-Verbs and う-Verbs follow their regular conjugation rules when making a relative clause. In the first example, we can see that 'Takashi-san is a man that lives in Tokyo', is one sentence, rather than 'Takashi-san is a man. He lives in Tokyo'. In English, words like 'that', and 'which' are used to create a relative clause. However, seeing as though these words do not exist in Japanese, the first phrase is simply attached to the noun.

This structure may be translated as 'if only (A)', or 'isn't there a way to (A)', but the literal translation is closer to 'I wonder if it really is a thing that can't (A)'. This grammar pattern will primarily be seen attached to the negated form of verbs, but may also be used in reference to nouns when the ない is being used to indicate a lack of existence of (A), rather than a lack of ability to do (A). As can be seen in these examples, the polite でしょう may replace だろう. Additionally, similar structures such as かな or かしら may replace だろうか or でしょうか in more casual conversations."

The case marking particle と in this expression highlights a 'result'. To use おうとする , modify the (A) verb into its う or よう receiving form, and then add とする. As う and よう mark volition (the express intent to do something), とする adds the nuance that the express intent has been decided, and all that remains is to 'do' the action. This translates quite closely to 'to endeavor to do' in English, where the past form 'endeavored to do' will suggest that the attempt was unsuccessful. Caution ようとする is also regularly used to indicate when one action interrupts another. In these cases, the nuance is not quite 'to have endeavored', but more '(A) was already underway, when (B)'. Again, it will just show that the (A) action was decided upon 100%, when something caused an unexpected change."
