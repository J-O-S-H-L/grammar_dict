                        "content": "あげる is a verb with many uses in Japanese. It's original meaning is 'to raise', but is also used as a polite speech way of saying 'to give'. In this way it can be thought of as similar to 'to offer up' in English. As polite speech has the same basic subject and object rules as standard speech, the giver will be marked with は or が , while the recipient will be marked with に . As usual, the 'object' that is being given will be marked with を . From these three examples, we can see that the order of 'giver', 'recipient', and 'object' does not matter, so long as the correct particles are used. Caution あげる should not be used when giving something to someone of a higher status, or when lowering oneself to elevate another. This is done through honorific language , or humble speech , and will use different verbs. Fun Fact Although あげる is considered polite speech, it is the most natural way of saying 'to give'. やる is the 'casual' equivalent of あげる , but due to やる sounding a little bit rough, あげる became the standard."

Caution Occasionally, the kanji 在 る may sometimes also be used. Although the difference between these two kanji is slight, 有 り indicates 'inclusiveness as part of a whole', while 在 り focuses more on 'stand-alone existence'."

However, its meaning is the same as the modern どう 'how'. Because of this, いかなる is interchangeable with どんな 'what kind of', with the exception that it is primarily used only in books and formal writing. いかなる is classified as being attributive, meaning that it will appear directly before a noun, or modify a noun somewhere within the same clause. Just like どんな, when に is added to いかなる , a negative statement will usually follow. This translates as 'no matter how much (A)', or 'no matter what kind of (A)'. However, に will not directly follow いかなる like it does with どんな. Instead, it will appear later in the sentence before the verb. Occasionally, いかな may also be used, but this is far less common. Fun Fact Both な and なる are derived from the classical auxiliary verb なり. Structures that stem from なり can be seen in many modern parts of the Japanese language. This also includes なら, the hypothetical form of だ, which shares the same meaning of 'to be' as なり. While な is the form that appears with most adjectival nouns, なる is still sometimes used in place of な when the speaker wants to be poetic, or give a sense of archaism."

The conjugation form of an い-Adjective is simply created by removing the い, and replacing it with く. く is then followed by ない (conjugated into its past form なかった ), or あります (conjugated into its past negative form ありませんでした ). The polite negative (past) form requires use of the う - Verb , ある . This is not a unique rule for the negative past, but actually the correct way that all く-form conjugations of い-Adjectives should be constructed. However, in modern Japanese, it is not considered necessary. Instead, the semi-polite form is often used. The semi-polite form is constructed by using なかった , and then simply adding です ."

It quite often (but not always) carries the nuance of (A) being the 'best', or the 'optimal' time/space within which (B) could occur/exist. In English, うちに can simply be translated as 'while', or 'during'. うちに may be paired with the dictionary or ている form of verbs, the plain form of い-Adjectives , nouns followed by の, or な-Adjectives that are followed by な. Unlike 間 に , うちに expresses something that can happen/exist anywhere 'within' the span of (A), and is therefore non-specific as to where (B) is located. Fun Fact The kanji 裡 refers literally to the inner walls/lining of something, and anything that is enclosed within that space. This can be thought of as where the 'non-specificity' of うち comes from, in regard to where within that space something is."

In the case of negation, the additional component will be ない (casual), or ません (polite). As can be seen here, the kana change differs depending on whether ない or ません is being used. If ない will be used, the last kana will always change from the kana ending with a う sound, to the kana ending with an あ sound within the same row. If ません will be used, the change will be from the う sound kana to the い sound kana. The only exception to this rule are verbs that end in the kana う. Instead of changing to あ (the あ sound kana in the same row), う will become わ, when used with ない . While the common translation of ない and ません is simply 'not', they actually have several possible nuances. These nuances are 'don't' (usually not), 'won't' (intentionally not), or 'can't' (unintentionally not). Both ない and ません are auxiliary verbs (ません is a conjugation of ます), meaning that they have their own set of conjugation rules. Caution The ない attached to make the negative form of adjectives is a different word, and therefore follows different conjugation rules. The ない attached to adjectives is an い-Adjective itself, and not an auxiliary verb ."

In most cases, 恐 らく is simply used as a formal way to say 'probably', or 'perhaps', and is usually partnered with other structures of conjecture such as だろう, かもしれない, etc. As 恐 らく behaves adverbially, it will most often appear at the beginning of sentences before a statement of conjecture is made. Although 恐 らく can, and often does, carry the meaning of 'I fear that (A)', it isn't necessarily always used in relation to negative things. In the case of this particular grammar pattern, the main nuance that 'I fear that (A)' conveys is modesty on behalf of the speaker in that they fear their assumption may be right, given the available information. Fun-fact Yodan, or 四段活用 verbs are a type of classical-Japanese verb that have primarily been replaced by godan (う-Verbs) in modern day Japanese."

                        "content": "The sentence ending particle かい is a grammar structure that is used in Japanese to highlight a question. Despite commonly being thought of as one word, it is actually the combination of か (the sentence-ending particle) and い, another sentence-ending particle that is primarily used by men (in a similar way to ね and よ ). かい will usually be used directly after the word or phrase that it is highlighting. In the case of verbs and い-Adjectives , の may be inserted before かい . For な-Adjectives and nouns, なの may be inserted directly before it. However, の (or なの ) are frequently omitted, due to how casual かい is. When it is not omitted, の (or なの ) may be shortened to ん (or なん）. This is in the same way that の and なの would behave in the のです and なのです grammar structures. Although there are some exceptions, かい will almost always be used to ask simple yes/no questions. Caution Because かい is very casual, and quite direct, it often sounds like an accusation. Due to this, care should be taken with your tone of voice, so as not to be taken the wrong way. Fun Fact Outside of かい , the sentence ending particle い is not commonly used in modern Japanese, and therefore will only appear in a few very specific structures (like だい). Despite being similar to ね , い is considered to be fairly ぞんざい 'rough', and should only be used with people that you are very familiar with, and never to someone above you."

As a grammatical structure, it will be translated as 'while (A)', 'in addition to (A)', or 'besides (A)'. かたわら may come after nouns followed by の, or after the dictionary form of verbs. Something that can be remembered from the 'bystander' meaning of this word is that かたわら will always come after the primary action or state of (A), while (B) is considered to just be there incidentally to (A), or as being done secondarily to it. This usually takes the form of something like a side job or a hobby. Caution Unlike ながら, かたわら does not necessarily indicate two actions that are happening at the exact same time, just actions that are happening independently of each other with one being the focus, and the other happening to a lesser extent within the same subject's life, day to day activities, etc."

Literally, the meaning is close to 'before (A) could even be confirmed as having happened, (B)'. かと 思 うと and かと 思 ったら will regularly appear after verbs in either their dictionary or past-tense forms. Alternatively, this structure may also be seen following nouns, especially when the meaning is focused on the speaker's feelings about (A). Either なの (or の when used with verbs) may appear between the target phrase and かと 思 ったら when the (B) phrase includes the speaker's feelings. Caution - Occasionally, か may be omitted from this phrase, leaving only と 思 うと and と 思 ったら . Although the meaning is exactly the same, omission of the か will make the expression sound softer."

This structure will be seen connected to the ます-stem of verbs, or after nouns followed by に. Both the kanji and non-kanji forms may be used. It is quite common to see 兼 ねない come after conditional phrases that include と, ば, たら, でも, and similar structures. This indicates that 'if (A) were to happen, (B) may also occur'. Caution While this grammar structure is most often used to highlight negative outcomes, it may also be used to indicate or desire or wish sarcastically. Fun-fact As 兼 ねる means 'to spread across', in the negative, this expression can be thought of as similar to 'to not be a stretch' in English. It just indicates the action of (A) would not be a stretch of the ability or capacity of whoever or whatever is being discussed."

                        "content": "かもしれない is an expression in Japanese that is often treated as a single word, but is actually the combination of the particle かも , and the potential form of the う-Verb 知 る (to know) with the auxiliary verb ない attached. かもしれない is regularly translated simply as 'might', or 'maybe', but the literal translation is much closer to 'even (A), we cannot know'. To use かもしれない , attach it to the end of any verb, noun, な-Adjective or い-Adjective , in their non-polite (keigo) forms. As the う-Verb 知 る is part of this construction, it may also be altered to its polite- potential form, creating かもしれません . Due to かもしれない being such a common grammar pattern in daily speech for expressing uncertainty about various things, several colloquial forms also exist. These are かも , かもしらん , and かもしれん . かも is by far the most common of these colloquial forms, with かもしらん potentially sounding a little bit rough/boyish."

It is usually translated as 'or', or 'either (A) or (B)'. Originally, this structure was a contraction of the conjunctive stem of い-Adjectives, く, and the imperative form of the う-Verb ある 'to be', あれ. い-Adjectives do not have their own imperative form , so くあれ and then the abbreviation かれ evolved to fill this role. As it is imperative, the literal meaning is simply 'be it (A) or (B)', and is a declaration. かれ～かれ will attach to the stem of 2 adjectives that are antonyms, before going on to explain how the result remains the same regardless. かれ～かれ is used with a very limited set of adjectives, so it is best not to use it with words that you have not come across previously. Caution In the case of 良 い 'good' and 悪 い 'bad', 悪 い will be read as 悪 しかれ, which comes from the archaic 悪 し 'bad'. This is considered as set phrase in modern Japanese."

(said with a rising tone). This nuance of か can be used after the dictionary form of almost any word in Japanese. However, using です or ます will change the nuance from 'presenting possibilities', to 'asking a formal question', so should be avoided."

The polite form of いる conjugates as います . Due to the る being removed, we can determine that いる is a る-Verb (Ichidan verb) . The kanji form of 居 る is quite common, and should be learned as early as possible to save any confusion while reading. There is no nuance difference between this expression being used with or without kanji, and is up to the preference of the writer.

It conveys that someone is 'apt to (A)', 'tends to (A)', or 'is prone to (A)'. Although not always negative, がち is most frequently used to express negative tendencies. Fun Fact がち as a grammar structure comes from the word 勝 ち, meaning 'a win'. 勝 ち in itself is used to express something that appears 'repeatedly', or 'again and again'. Due to this, がち may be thought of as similar to 'to win out' in English, meaning that 'although there are many possibilities, (A) winning out is the most likely'. This 'winning out' may be due to preference, or sheer good/bad luck."

To use 見 られる , simply add it after the noun that you would like to show as being 'evident'. As られる is both the potential and passive form of 見 る, it may be interpreted either way.

From these examples, we can see that が is simply highlighting that 'while (A) is important, there is extra information'. が with the meaning of 'but' is considered to be very formal, this is due to it sounding quite direct in asserting that there is extra information. Caution Sometimes a statement will end with が . In these cases it just means that more information exists, but it is obvious, so it does not need to be said."

All な-Adjectives behave similarly to verbs, in that their form changes depending on what comes after them. For 嫌 い , it will be followed by either な , when acting as an adjective, だ , or the more polite です , when acting as a noun. This distinction is made depending on whether it is linked to another noun, or is independent. In the example with だ , 嫌 い is expressing that the thing is 'dislikable' (assertion). However, in the example with な , 嫌 い is expressing 'being disliked' as a quality of the noun it is attached to. In the same way that 好 き can often be partnered with 大 to mean 'love', 嫌 い can often be partnered with 大 to mean 'hate'. Caution Despite ending in い, 嫌 い is one of the few words that is actually a な-Adjective , and needs to be memorized."

It comes from the kanji 位 , which literally means a 'rank', or 'grade' of something. This use of くらい comes after numbers, or counter words. As can be seen in the last example, くらい may also be used after question words such as どの , when asking about the extent (grade) of something. Due to the original meaning of くらい being 'rank', or 'extent', it may not be used when referring to broad periods of time. ころ will be used in these situations. However, くらい and ころ may be used interchangeably when referring to a specific time (due to a specific time being able to be thought of as an extent). Caution Please see the ころ grammar point if you would like to compare these two structures further."

Like けど , it usually carries the meaning of 'but', but because of its formality, sounds a bit more like 'although', or 'provided that'. It simply highlights that 'while thinking about (A), (B)'. Meaning that the (B) phrase is important, or needs to be considered. As can be seen from these examples, だ will be required when using this conjunction after a な-Adjective , or a noun. As a reminder, please see below for a list of the most casual form of 'but', to the most formal. Casual - けど - けども - けれど - けれども - が - Formal. Fun Fact Originally, けれども was thought to be a more feminine version of が . However, the modern けど is so common that it has lost all of the feminine nuance that came from けれども . Caution As with けど (and other forms of 'but' in Japanese), the phrase after けれども will often be omitted if it is obvious, or the speaker does not want to say it."

Its main role is to highlight the preceding noun (or noun phrase) as being the the most important piece of information in relation to the rest of the sentence. In English, this is an effect that is primarily achieved through things like bold text, underlining, or emphasizing a particular word in speech. If we were to make a direct comparison to an English statement, then things like 'precisely because it's (A)', or 'rather it is due to (A)', are quite similar to こそ 's function. こそ can be used directly after any noun that would usually take the を , or が particles, so long as that particular piece of information needs to be emphasized. Caution The reason that こそ is able to replace が, but not は, is due to the fact that が primarily highlights specific pieces of information, while は nominates general topics. This means that they have completely opposite functions. To make things easier, the three particles can be thought of in the following way: は- Weakly highlights specific information. が- Strongly highlights specific information. こそ - Very strongly highlights specific information. Fun Fact こそ is often used after names or pronouns, as a way to reply to thanks/apologies. In these situations, it expresses that the speaker feels equally (or more) obliged to say what was just said to them by someone else."

It will be translated as 'due to (A)', or 'because of (A)'. This is a fairly old-fashioned expression, and will almost exclusively be used in writing in modern Japanese. To use こととて , attach it to the end of a verb, or a noun followed by the case-marking particle の. こととて will primarily be used when asking for forgiveness for something. Due to this, when appearing after verbs, the verb will usually be in past tense, or have been negated with either ない or ぬ. This highlights something that was done and shouldn't have been, or wasn't done and should have been. In many cases, (A) will be something for which the negative result of (B) is obvious, or to be expected. Fun Fact とて is thought to either be a combination of the case-marking particle と and the conjunction particle て, or the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb たり, と, and the conjunction particle て. As the origin is unclear, it will be best to think of it as its own structure, that carries its own original meaning."

It is a combination of the nominalizing use of こと (for creating noun-phrases), and the ている-form of the う-Verb なる 'to become'. The primary difference between ことになる and ことになっている is that the latter focuses more on that something is 'expected to (A)', or 'scheduled to (A)'. In other words, it is 'becoming that (A)', but has not actually happened yet. This structure is often used after either the る or ない versions of verbs, in order to highlight the action which either is not not 'expected', or 'scheduled' to occur. Let's take a look at the 'scheduled to' meaning first. When indicating that something is 'expected to (A)', this is an example of ている's use for expressing habitual or ongoing actions/states that reoccur under some specific set conditions."

In these cases, (A) is a verb that will appear directly before こと. ことはない is often used to reassure someone that something will not come to pass. In this expression, the adverbial particle は is working to present (A) as the extent (a regular role of adverbial particles), while the 形容詞 ない negates that extent. This negation is up to interpretation, with the literal meaning simply being 'There is no (A)'. Caution This structure is very different to たことがない, which presents a single instance of something not having happened. As opposed to the case marking particle が, は presents the verb/verb-phrase as a topic itself in non-past form, highlighting its non-existence. Due to this, ことはない can imply that (A) is unthinkable, or even impossible."

It also regularly appears after other particles, forming a dual-particle meaning. This use of さえ is an example of limit , with (A) being a hypothetical limit presented by the ば particle. It is also possible to see さえ with other hypothetical indicators (such as たら ), but is quite rare in modern Japanese, as さえ～ば is considered a set pattern. This limitation is also sometimes referred to as a 'stipulation', or 'condition' ."

These are as follows: 誘 い、 促 し - To invite, incite, or draw attention to something. 驚 き、 当惑 し - To express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment. 話 の 流 れ を 抑 える - To control or keep in check the flow of a conversation. In this lesson, we will be focusing on the first meaning (to invite or draw attention). In English, this is usually translated as 'there we go', 'ok then', or 'well you see'. さ (or sometimes さあ) will come at the beginning of a sentence, before the point that the speaker would like to highlight is explained. Caution This さ and the さ used for expressing confusion or bewilderment are often used interchangeably. When drawing attention, it comes across like 'well you see', but when expressing confusion, it is closer to 'well let me see'. The latter has a slight nuance of 'let me think about my answer first'."

A more literal translation which may carry the strength of this grammar pattern a bit better would be 'while however, (B)', or 'even while true, (B)'. Just like in English, the extension of the phrase in Japanese adds emphasis to the overall meaning. しかしながら will primarily appear at the beginning of a new sentence when referring back to something that has previously been stated, either by the speaker themselves or by another.

These structures are simply added to the base form of the noun or な-Adjective . じゃ and では can also be used with the negative ます form of ある , to create the polite variant. ない is sometimes said/written as ね or ねえ . However, this is considered very casual, or even a bit rough. Accordingly, it is best avoided in most conversations. Caution じゃない is used very frequently to ask questions. This is similar to じゃないか , a grammar point covered in another lesson. However, the nuance difference is that じゃない as a question is a little bit more blunt, like 'isn't it?' in English. On the other hand, じゃないか is more like 'don't you think?'. When じゃない is used as a question, it will usually be obvious, due to a rising tone."

The first is that something keeps going in a constant state, without ever stopping/resting, and the second is to emphasize an amount of something. We will examine the first meaning in this lesson. To use ずっと , add it to the beginning of the phrase that you want to highlight as being ongoing. Alternatively, ずっと can be used after から , to express that something has been continuing 'ever since' some specific event/point in time. Fun Fact ずっと literally means that something is 'unwavering', or 'unfaltering'. Due to this, the statement that ずっと is attached to will always be perceived as being 'far more (A)', or 'to the maximum amount possible for (A)', regardless of whether it is highlighting a noun, verb, or an adjective."

It has the equivalent role of ない, in expressing that something 'has not', or 'will not' happen. The case marking particle に is then combined with the adverbial particle は, and the negative-potential form of いる, いられない. ずにはいられない may be translated as 'cannot help doing (A)', or 'cannot resist doing (A)'. ずにはいられない will be attached to the indeterminate form of verbs. This is the same stem form as ない uses. Although ずにはいられない is often translated as 'cannot resist (A)', the literal meaning is simply 'cannot be without (A)'. Caution As the modern indeterminate form of する has several different forms, care will need to be taken when conjugating する verbs. While ない joins with し to create しない, ず will join with せ to create せず."

To use ずに, attach it to the indeterminate form of the verb that you wish to express as 'without doing (A)'. This is the same form used with ない. ずに is quite a bit more formal than ないで, but still frequently used in modern Japanese. Especially as part of set phrases, like ずにすむ (which we will learn about in another lesson). Caution When used with a する verb, する will become せずに, not しずに. Both せ and し are indeterminate forms of する . し, the more common form that is used in east Japan appears with ない."

                        "content": "In Japanese, there are several adverbs that are traditionally used exclusively with negative expressions (containing ない). 全然 is one of them. When used at the beginning of a ない (or ません) containing phrase, 全然（ぜんぜん) has the meaning of 'completely not (A)', or 'not (A) at all'. In writing, it is equally as natural to use either 全然 as kanji, or hiragana only, so both forms may be used confidently. ぜんぜん is more flexible (and friendly sounding) in casual conversation than 全 く , a similar expression which has a formal (often negative) nuance. While both of these sentences have the meaning of 'not (A) at all', まったく could give the listener the impression that you are not pleased with the situation. This will depend quite a bit on tone of voice, though. Caution Despite originally being used only with negative expressions, it is becoming more and more common for ぜんぜん to appear with positive expressions as well. In these cases, it just has the meaning of 'totally (A)', or 'completely (A)'. Although this is technically not grammatically correct, it is becoming so frequently used that it is considered correct by most people (especially the younger generation)."

                        "content": "The auxiliary verb そうだ has two primary functions in Japanese. It can convey one of the following things: Hearsay: 伝聞 - Highlighting things that have been heard from other people. Appearance: 様態 - Highlighting the way that things 'appear', or 'seem'. The appearance nuance is covered in another lesson, so we will focus on hearsay in this grammar point. When used to repeat statements that have been heard from other people/sources, そうだ (or そう です ) will be paired with the plain form of a verb or い-Adjective , or a noun/ な-Adjective followed by だ . そうだ always implies that the speaker is not 100% certain about the validity of the information that they are conveying. Due to this, it does not sound as confident as other expressions, like ようだ . Caution In order to avoid confusion between the そうだ that is used for repeating information, and the そうだ that is used for making observations, the following differences will need to be memorized. Verbs - 降 るそうだ - Unaltered verb, そうだ that is repeating information. 降 りそうだ - Conjunctive form , そうだ that is used for making observations. い-Adjectives - 寒 いそうだ - Unaltered adjective, そうだ that is repeating information. 寒 そうだ - い removed, そうだ that is used for making observations. Nouns and な-Adjectives - 綺麗 だそうだ - だ  is used before そうだ. This is repeating information. 綺麗 そうだ - No だ between the な-Adjective and そうだ. This is making an observation."

The broad meaning in each of its applications is that something 'seems' to be a certain way. Due to this, そう is regularly translated as 'seems like', 'looks like', or 'appears as though'. In this lesson, we will focus on the form that is used with the conjunctive (stem) form of words. Please examine the structure guide to see these forms. Caution そう may also be used when attached to the い-Adjective , ない. In this case, there is a unique conjugation rule which we will need to be careful of. As always, い will be removed from ない before attaching そう . However, さ will be inserted between な, and そう . This creates the expression なさそう. Note that this addition of さ does not happen with verbs. This is due to the ない that is used with negative verbs being an auxiliary verb ,  and not an い-Adjective . With the auxiliary verb ない, simply remove the い, before adding そう directly to the stem. Caution This そう is utilized exclusively to make predictions/guesses about something based on visual information. It is relatively low confidence, so should not be used for things that are obvious. In these cases, みたい would be used instead."

Although verbs combining with the conjunction particle ば is the standard form of this grammar structure. The conjunction particle たら may also occasionally be used. Frequently this grammar structure will be seen in sentences that include ても or でも in the first half, with ばそれまでだ coming closer to the end. This indicates that ‘even if (A), if also (B), then there’s no point’. Caution と 言 われればそれまでだ is a set expression that means ‘while it is true that (A), (B)’, or ‘although certainly (A), (B)’. It is often used for politely expressing one’s personal opinion in relation to something. This phrase literally means ‘if It were to be said that it was (A), then that’s all there is to it, but (B)’."

The difference in nuance is that something marked with が is considered to be wanted more. たい is conjugated in the same way as い-Adjectives , meaning that the negative , past , or past-negative forms may also be used. たい is only used for expressing things that 'you' want, or repeating information/asking questions about what other people want. It may not be used to make guesses about what other people 'may' want, unless asking them directly. Caution たい is not used to tell other people that you want them to do something. This is done with ～てほしい . Caution たい is not usually used when giving invitations (asking someone if they want to do something with you). In these cases ～ませんか is far more natural."

Frequently, (A) will be a verb that indicates movement, continuation, or hope. This highlights that one has already done everything that is possible, and all that is left to do is hope for a good result, or that one is already doing all that is necessary, and all that remains is to continue. When する-Verbs are used with this expression, occasionally it will be replaced by ある. This puts more focus on the existence of the action, rather than the action itself. The replacement of する with ある is primarily literary."

Fun Fact たて is a suffix that is used to convey the moment in time directly after something has been finished, rather than the fact that it 'is' finished. Due to this, たて is most frequently used with verbs that indicate some sense of time based importance, where (A) will degrade in quality over time after completion."

As with most other grammar patterns that ところ is seen with, the focus is on the situation of the verb occurring. ～たところで is often translated as 'even if (A), not (B)', or 'even if (A), it won't be (B)'. This 'even if' nuance is created by the fact that ～たところで sentences will never have something in the past tense in the second half of the sentence, despite using the past tense before ところ. This is similar to the English 'even if (A) were to happen, (B) would still not occur'. As can be seen by the examples above, ～たところで will convey things that are counter to what the speaker either wants to, or wishes would happen. Due to this, the (B) half of the sentence will almost always be something unfavorable. Fun Fact Due to ～たところで always marking some kind of negative result in (B), (A) will often be preceded by words such as 今 さら, いくら, or どんなに. These usually just emphasize the frustration that the speaker feels about the inevitable result."

However, it is classified as a non-independent word in Japanese, and must always be connected to another word which illustrates the 'sake' that ため is highlighting. The case marking particle に will often be added after ため, to show that (A) is a goal that something will done to reach. However, when used with verbs in the past tense, ために more frequently highlights that something happened 'due to (A)', rather than 'for the sake of (A)'. Because of this, a more accurate description of ため in all situations is 'in light of (A)'. This expresses that (A) is the primary or major event/thing that resulted in (B). To use ために as 'in light of', 'as a result of', or 'because of', attach it to the end of verb in its past form, or a noun follow by の. It may also be used after い-Adjectives or な-Adjectives in their attributive form . This 'in light of (A)' nuance can be used in reference to things that have already happened (as above), or in reference to something that is considered as the purpose of an action (as in our other ために grammar point)."

Sometimes たら is used by itself, with a tone that implies that it is a question (or simply by adding a question mark in written language). This is an abbreviation of たらどう , and carries the same nuance. だ or か may be added to the end of たらどう , to emphasize the 'question' even further. However, they are not required. Caution Despite being used for giving advice, たらどう may be interpreted as criticism. Due to this, care will need to be taken with your tone of voice."

However, instead of having the nuance of 'then', or 'and', it has the nuance of 'and things like'. Basically, it is used for listing sequences of events that do not happen in a specific order. The last たり in any sequence will almost always be followed by する (or した for past tense). From these examples we can see that たり will sometimes be said as だり . This happens with the same verbs that usually use だ for past tense (like 読 んだ), or で for the て form ( like 泳 いで). This will not change the meaning at all, and is only to help make the words easier to say. To summarize, the difference between て form, and たり is as follows. Events in order - I did (A) て , (B) て , (C) て , (D) た. Events in no specific order - I did (D) たり , (B) たり , (A) たり , (C) たり した . たり is frequently used when there is only one verb in the sentence. This just means that the speaker did 'things like (A)', without specifically listing anything else. Caution In cases where a する verb is the last verb in a particular sequence, たり will often be omitted."

Due to this, we can see that だ is being used to 'determine' that a statement is true, while が simply shows that there is other important information to follow. In this way, だが is very similar to the expression 'that may be, but…' in English. だが may be used at the beginning of any phrase, or between sentences. Caution When using ですが , it will automatically mean that the rest of the sentence should also use polite speech . To make だが sound a little bit softer, sometimes ね is added. However, this is not so common in modern-day Japanese, and is more limited to the older generation. Fun Fact Due to だが and ですが using が (the formal equivalent of けど ), this phrase can sound quite stiff. Therefore, it is far more common to hear でも at the beginning of a sentence in casual speech."

The conjunction particle て should follow なく, as it is the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective ない. However, the て in this particular construction is very often omitted. Caution In writing, if there is no comma (known as a 読点 in Japanese) after なく, the full なくて construction will be required. When a comma is present, both forms are grammatically correct."

The same verb will be repeated both before and after だけは , with the one coming second usually appearing in its past-tense or ている form. Imagining that the target verb was 食 べる 'to eat', the literal translation of something like 食 べる だけは 食 べた would be 'I ate just what I could eat'. Because this pattern frequently discusses possibilities, it is also very common for the first verb to be in the potential れる or られる form. Caution It is also relatively common to see する omitted following the first verb, and only being used after だけは . In this kind of pattern, the target verb itself will not usually be repeated after だけは ."

Caution だ should never be attached to the end of い-Adjectives . In these cases, it is considered more correct to attach a polite equivalent, like です . Caution While だ is often thought of as the 'casual form' of です , that is actually not entirely true. です is a polite speech word. The official 'formal version' of だ is である . We will learn this grammar point a bit later. である can often be seen in articles, and formal writing, while です is more common in polite speech ."

It is usually translated as 'there are no words to express (A)', or 'too (A) for words'. This structure is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the conjunction particle たら 'when', or 'if', and the い-Adjective ない. It may be used in either positive or negative contexts. といったらない , or the shortened form ったらない may appear after adjectives or nouns in their standard form s. The ない in this grammar pattern is commonly thought to be an abbreviation of ありはしない, or ありゃしない, the conjunctive form of the う-Verb ある combined with the case marking particle は, and the negated form of する, しない. In this way, a more literal meaning can be thought of as 'if one were to say (A), it's not possible'. Caution As this expression highlights an extreme amount, い-Adjectives will often be used with the さ suffix added, specifically to indicate amount."

Just like with と , the verb that comes after って is frequently omitted. This is even more true for って , as many things are omitted in casual language. Caution Although often heard, due to って being very casual, it can be considered unnatural to use in sentences that also use the です or ます polite structures.

Fun Fact Although 'accidentally' is the most common meaning of つい , it actually may be used to convey three different nuances. These are as follows: はからず - Something that is uncalculated. 思 わず - Something that is not thought about. 距離 が わずかなさま - A small gap/interval. In each of these meanings, つい keeps a sense of time being the most important factor. Due to this, つい will give the impression that whatever resulted in the 'accidental' action, will be something that happened momentarily. This is very close to the meaning of 'lapse' in English. 'a lapse in time', 'a lapse in judgment', 'a lapse in forethought'."

This つ～つ structure is often translated as 'to be doing (A) and (B) over and over', where the actions are happening repeatedly one after the other. つ will connect to the conjunctive form of verbs, with (A) and (B) generally appearing in direct sequence. Additionally, it is also quite common to see the same verb being repeated in both places. When this happens, the (A) verb will be in the standard form , while the (B) verb will be in the passive form. This just translates as 'to do (A) and to have (A) done to oneself'. Caution This grammar pattern is only used with a limited set of words in modern Japanese. Here is a list of some standard combinations. 行 きつ 戻 りつ - To go back and forth. 浮 きつ 沈 みつ - To surface and submerge (to bob). 見 えつ 隠 れつ - To go in and our of sight. とつおいつ (from 取 りつ 置 きつ) - To waver between. 矯 めつ 眇 めつ - To take a good look. 組 んず 解 れつ - To intertwine and release (to grapple). 抜 きつ 抜 かれつ - To pull away and be pulled away from (to be neck and neck). 持 ちつ 持 たれつ - To have and to be held (to give and take). 押 しつ 押 されつ - To press and be pressed. 追 いつ 追 われつ - To overtake and be overtaken. 差 しつ 差 されつ - To pour and be poured (to take turns exchanging drinks)."

Generally, it is translated in a similar way as てもらえませんか 'won't you (A)', or 'could you please (A)'. This construction and いただく itself can regularly be seen as 頂 く, its kanji form. Due to this kanji literally meaning 'to be topped with', it is just acknowledging that the person that is doing the action for you (or someone in your group), is doing so from 'above' (sounds more respectful). Here we can see how the 'to be topped/capped with' meaning is used in a standard sentence."

In this way, ておく can be thought of as meaning 'to do (A) and leave it (until later)'. When using ておく , the 'future event' that the (A) action is being done for may be something that is coming soon, or may be something that the speaker doesn't want to ever come. Due to this, ておく is also regularly used when the speaker is doing something specifically to prevent another thing from happening. Caution ておく is sometimes contracted to とく (or どく in verbs where て would usually be said as で ). Although this is not excessively common in conversation, it is very common in drama, manga, and similar media."

It is usually translated as 'please try to (A)', where (A) is the verb that ご 覧 is connected to, through the use of the conjunction particle て. However, despite being translated as 'please try to (A)', the literal meaning of 覧 is 'to look', or 'to peruse' (to look at one's own leisure, without needing to rush). Due to this, てごらん can be thought of as being quite similar to てみる 'to try', but with the added emphasis of 'try as you like, when it suits you'. Caution As ご 覧 is honorific language , it cannot be used to refer to your own actions, or things that you will 'try'. It will only ever be used to make suggestions to other people about what they should try. Caution Sometimes ごらん and なさい will be paired together. This slightly increases the strength of the suggestion, and may be perceived as a very light command. Because of this, ごらんなさい is primarily used by superiors/elders, when requesting that a subordinate/younger person try something."

This structure is almost exclusively seen with verbs, but may occasionally be seen with い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns as well. The verb that てはいられない is connected to is often considered to be something that cannot continue on due to either some time-based or feeling-based limitation. In this way, it regularly has the nuance of '(A) cannot continue due to (B)', with the reason of (B) mentioned in another part of the sentence. When appearing with い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns, the nuance will change slightly, and simply reflects the meaning of いられない itself in conveying that (A) 'cannot be', or is 'impossible' in some way. As always, ては will be replaced by では in the case of nouns and な-Adjectives."

However, it is almost always simply used to convey that there is no issue with something. ても 構 わない may be used with any type of word that appears in its ても or でも conjugation form.

Verb て 初 めて literally means 'with (A) done, for the first time (B)'. Often, this translates similarly to 'only after I (A) did I (B)', or 'not until (A) did I (B)'. In this structure, it should be noted that the (A) verb is not necessarily being done for the first time ever, just that this time resulted in the speaker's first experience of (B). Caution Originally, 始 めて 'commencing with' and 初 めて 'starting with' were both used with this expression. However, this is considered incorrect in modern Japanese, as only 初 めて strictly carries the meaning of 'for the first time'."

Both structures are usually translated as 'even if (A), (B)', or 'no matter if (A), (B)'. Despite this, the more literal meaning of each is closer to 'so it's (A), (B) still won't be affected'. This just emphasizes the fact that (A) is of no relation to the result, like saying 'so what if it is' in English. Both であれ and であろうと will primarily attach to nouns in sentences that express some kind of question or assumption through words like どんな or たとえ. As both であれ and であろうと use structures that indicate strong will, these grammar patterns will frequently be used in sentences where the speaker is expressing their opinions or resolutions."

In the above, we can see that, in both examples, the speaker is looking for confirmation that/affirming that the listener agrees with them. As でしょう is a conjugation of です (the polite form of だ), it usually follows the plain form of words, rather than words using ～ます. However, in very formal situations, or older literature ～ます でしょう may be seen.

This form is ではなく , and may appear either with or without the conjunction particle て attached to the end. ではなくて is commonly seen grouped with nouns, or other words that have been nominalized through the use of の or こと. In ではなくて , the adverbial particle は is not strictly required. However, as this expression is comparing what (A) is 'not' to what (B) 'is', the contrast that は provides means that the phrase will sound far more natural with its inclusion. Caution て sometimes performs in a similar way to a 'comma' in Japanese, allowing structures to appear together that usually wouldn't. Due to this, if て is omitted from ではなくて , ではなく may not be linked directly to the next word, and a comma will be required. Regarding adjectives, this く form is known as the conjunctive form , and may only be linked directly with other 用言 (conjugatable words), altering or adding to their overall meaning."

At its core, it is always used to highlight something that is 'required' to perform some sort of action/reach some kind of goal. One of these uses relates to 'things'. This comes across as 'by' or 'with' in English. In these sentences, the item is considered essential for the action to be performed. While other items may be used, で simply highlights the one that was chosen. で is also used when groups of people perform actions together, this is something that many people learning Japanese have trouble with initially (because と may also be used as 'with' for people). However, the use of で is actually the same as this by/with, meaning that the speaker considers the group as the tool used for performing the action. The difference between と and で as 'with', is that で is used when everyone in the group has the same objective/end goal. と is used when each person is performing the action toward each other, not toward an external objective."

However, unlike some other structures (like なら , たら , and ば ), と implies that the 'if' result of と is something that will definitely happen, or is a natural consequence of (A) happening. When combined with the い-Adjective いい, it means 'if (A), it would be good'. This construction may be used with any phrase ending in a word in its standard form . Because と expresses a 'certain' outcome, the 'good' in this grammar construction often sounds quite strong, leading to といい regularly being translated closer to 'I hope (A)', or 'I wish (A)'. There are several situations in which this grammar point can be used to express that you are hoping something for yourself, or hoping something for someone else. This is primarily determined by the use of な, or ん だけど (hoping for yourself), or ね (hoping for others/mutual benefit). Caution When this expression finishes with けど , けれども , or が , it can imply that there are some external factors that will make the desired result difficult to achieve."

It is most common for this structure to appear following either verbs or nouns, but may also occasionally follow adjectives. Coming primarily at the end of sentences, というところ will often be followed immediately by the auxiliary verb だ or です. Occasionally, という will be replaced by the past-tense form, といった. However, the meaning does not change at all in these cases. Caution というところ has a tendency to be used when the number being given is the theoretical maximum for something, rather than the theoretical minimum. Due to this, it may sound unnatural when wanting to present an approximate minimum."

As with many grammar patterns, the version with も will be considered a bit more emphasized. というものではない may follow any word in its standard form, but may occasionally be preceded by だ when used with nouns or な-Adjectives (despite not being required). In most cases, this grammar pattern will indicate that while most of the time (A) might be something that is expected to be true, there are exceptions.

Due to という quoting the previous statement as being the 'reason', という 理由 で puts quite a bit of emphasis on the reason itself. Because of this, the expression is quite similar to 'being that' in English. The case marking particle で will be used after 理由 to show that 'with' or 'by means of' that reason, (B). Fun Fact Almost all cases where という 理由 で will be used may be replaced by というわけで. However, the reverse is not true. The reason that わけ may be used for 理由 , but 理由 cannot always be used for わけ (especially at the beginning of sentences) is because わけ is another way of reading the kanji for 理由 . However, the more common kanji for 訳 will never be read as りゆう."

Due to this, despite the more literal translation of 'even if one were to say (A)', it is usually translated simply as 'even if (A)', or 'although (A)'. といえども will be seen following nouns, い-Adjectives, or verbs in any of their standard form . といえども may also follow な-Adjectives, but だ will precede といえども in these cases. Despite the nuance being slightly different, といえども can be thought of as a very old-fashioned way of saying といっても. Due to といえども being old-fashioned, it is often used for emphasis and will frequently be paired with expressions like いくら, いかに, どんなに, etc. Fun Fact Although very rarely used, sometimes いえども is seen as 雖 も. In these cases the kanji 雖 , which means 'however', is simply paired with も. This creates a slight difference between 'however even (A)', and the more modern 'even if one were to say (A)'. Despite this, the meanings are used interchangeably in modern times."

This is translated more naturally as 'you could say (A)', or 'you might say (A)'. As the と at the beginning of the phrase is the 'quotation' use of the と particle, と 言 ってもいい may be used after almost any statement that the speaker wants to quote. Fun Fact Most grammatical structures in Japanese that use 言 う will often appear without kanji. This is simply to make them easier to recognize as a grammar pattern, rather than a standard word in a sentence. This is also true for patterns that include 行 く, or 来 る ."

This meaning of 'or something' when using とか is fairly casual and will often be heard in everyday conversation. Caution This combination of と and か may appear the same as the とか used to indicate lists, but the former is simply a combination of the case-marking particle と, and the adverbial particle か, while the latter is a single listing particle . Despite this, both structures are originally combinations of と and か, and may be thought to have some overlap in meaning."

However, unlike some other time expressions, とき is mainly used to express things that happen at regular intervals (habits, hobbies, etc.), or at broad times/individual events (when it rains, when there is a sale at the shop, etc.) Using とき is quite easy! You just need to attach it to the end of any independent word (verbs, nouns, or adjectives). As with most cases where a noun will be attached to another word in Japanese, we will also be required to use な after な-Adjectives , and の after nouns. The case-marking particle に will generally come directly after 時 , signifying that another verb is about to follow. Caution As discussed previously, ときに is primarily used to discuss when things happened. What this means is that it will not be used to highlight ongoing states that were true during the first action. For example 'the time you tripped over a log on Tuesday'. When とき is used, the nuance will be that it is describing one thing leading to another, rather than a static thing."

The literal translation of ところで is closer to 'and with that', and implies that something (within the previous topic) suddenly reminded the speaker of another thing (that happens to be a new topic). Caution When ところで appears after the past tense of a verb as たところで, it carries a different meaning, and will express that something isn't the case, despite (A).

This word is an emphasized version of 疾 うに, a literary form which is not used much in modern Japanese. とっくに is a sentence altering adverb, so will appear most often at the beginning of sentences, or before the verb it is describing as having happened a long time ago. When compared with structures like すでに and もう , とっくに will either indicate something that has happened much further in the past, or may be used simply for exaggeration. Fun-fact It is uncommon to see とっくに listed with an exact time, as the stem (old Japanese) word 疾 し already means something close to 'far earlier', or 'at a much earlier time'."

This is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the adverbial particle は, the neologism 比 べもの 'a comparable thing', the case-marking particle に, and the negated form of the う-Verb なる 'to become', ならない. This may seem like a lot, but it is just expressing that '(A) will not be a comparable thing'. This structure will be used before nouns, where that noun is the thing that cannot be compared. This is usually due to quality, quantity, or some other feature that is easily measurable. As this grammar pattern is emphatic, it will indicate that the difference between (A) and (B) is quite large, without specifically expressing the amount. Additionally, like in the final example, we can sometimes see the use of the adverbial particle は a second time before ならない. This just adds further emphasis or highlights contrast. Fun Fact As a reminder, a neologism is just a set word or phrase which has come to be used a certain way due to habits or customs. 比 べもの itself is just a mix of the conjunctive form of the る-Verb 比 べる 'to compare', and the noun もの 'thing'."

It is a combination of the case-marking particle と in its ' quotation ' use, and the adverbial particle ばかり, exhibiting that something is 'basically exactly as described'. Due to this, とばかり simply indicates that while (A) is as described, it is not literally the case. とばかり can appear after almost any word, as the と is creating a quote. に will often follow ばかり when the sentence is going on to describe what is actually happening. とばかりに is an abbreviation of と 言 わんばかり 'to only just not be at the point where (A) is said', which itself will still be seen quite often. In this case, 言 わん is an abbreviation of 言 わぬ, making use of the classical auxiliary verb ぬ used for negation. Caution As とばかりに will be used to describe the way that something 'looks like it is about to say', it won't be used for describing the speaker themselves. However, it may occasionally be seen being used about the speaker if the sentence is in third person."

                        "content": "となると is a strong expression in Japanese that focuses on highlighting that once some relatively high threshold is reached, (B) will occur. While となると may be seen in several different forms, the base structure is a combination of the particle と, the う-Verb なる 'to become', and the particle と repeated in its use of highlighting a certain outcome. Standard translations are 'once (A), (B)', and 'when (A), (B)'. A more literal translation can be thought of as 'once (A) happens, it is sure to follow that (B)'. The other forms that となると may be seen in are ともなると , となれば , and ともなれば . The primary difference being that も adds slight emphasis. While ば and と do have slightly different nuances by default, in terms of this specific grammar point, they are used completely interchangeably. となると may be seen following nouns, or verbs in any of their standard form . も may also be used following the subject of ともなると sentences, and simply places emphasis on that subject. Fun Fact The emphasis that is seen in this grammar pattern is partly due to the function of the first と, and is one of the reasons that になると will not be used to convey a similar meaning. に and と are regularly used in this way in Japanese, with と almost always indicating that the outcome of something is unavoidable, cannot be controlled, is as to be expected. に merely focuses on the transition from (A) to (B)."

In a broader sense, と simply shows that there is a relationship of 'compilation' between (A) and (B). That relationship could be existing together (translated as ' and '), or performing an action together (translated as ' with '). In this case, we will focus on the 'and' translation. A full description of と as 'with' can be found here . と is required after every noun that it is grouped with. However, the last と in a sentence will often be omitted, if there are several. In this example, we can see that the last noun in the group (pencil) does not require the particle と , although it is considered more correct to have it. In conversation, the last と will almost always be omitted."

Originally, it is a combination of the adverb どう 'how', and the ても form of する , しても 'even doing'. どうしても will regularly be used at the beginning of sentences before conveying something that is considered by the speaker to be 'absolutely true'. Alternatively, どうしても may be used after verbs, following the case marking particle と. This will express that 'if (A) happens, (B) is unavoidable'. Fun Fact As the closest literal meaning of どう in English is 'any', どうしても also translates quite accurately as 'in any case'."

The change from ところ to どころ is a consistent sound change that is seen regularly in sentences that use 所 negatively. どころか may be translated as 'far from', 'let alone' or 'anything but'. It strongly negates any statement before it, while also emphasizing what comes after it. どころか may be paired with the attributive form of any other word. However, this is not a strict rule, as it can also be seen with the 語幹 stem form of な-Adjectives , and directly attached to nouns. Sentences that use どころか must always have a part (B) that emphasizes some type of far more important information (in the speaker's opinion). Fun Fact As か simply transforms どころ into either a question, or a statement of doubt, the literal translation of どころか is similar to 'it's not even remotely (A)' as a statement, or 'do you honestly think it's (A)!?', when asking a direct question."

Unlike the other 3, which all point to a specific thing, words starting with ど are designed for enquiring about something unknown. どれ can roughly be translated as 'which' in English, and is used for enquiring about a group (of 3 or more things). From these examples, we can see that the particle が is often used with どれ , especially when preceding questions. However, when どれ follows a noun, は will be used. When there are only two choices to select between, どちら + の ,  or どっち + の will be used instead of どれ . This is a habit that has become part of the language over time, and was not originally how these words were used."

This is a combination of ない, こと, に, は, and then something followed by ない in the (B) part of the sentence. Literally, it just means 'within the situation of (A) not being a thing, neither will (B)'. This structure may appear with verbs and い-Adjectives in their ない forms, or nouns followed by でない. In sentences that use ないことには～ない , (A) can be considered the condition for (B) being able to occur or proceed. Caution Occasionally, ないことには will be seen in sentences that do not finish with a word in the negative form. In these cases, ないことには implies that not being in the state of (A) will negatively affect (B). This translates similarly to 'without (A), unfortunately (B)', and often has structures like しまう following (B)."

It will often be translated as 'even though not (A), (B)', or 'it may not be (A), but (B)'. This structure usually presents some form of extreme (A) which has not yet been reached, but the lower extent of (B) cannot be denied. The literal translation is 'even though not reaching (A), (B)'. Depending on the source, this structure may occasionally be used with nouns. In this case, it will need to follow ではない, or the casual じゃない. This grammar pattern will be used in both positive and negative situations. For example, (A) may be the best outcome, where (B) is something just below that which is desirable, or (A) may be the worst outcome, where (B) is just below that, but still quite bad. Often, the (B) phrase will express some kind of wish or demand that the speaker wants to meet with structures like たい, てほしい, てください, たらどう, つもり, といい, etc."

Additionally, して may be added to the end of に, without any change to the nuance. ながらに is a structure that has many potential translations in English, but the key point to remember is that (B) is something that is being highlighted as happening or existing in same state as (A) in an unchanged state. This doesn't necessarily mean at the same time. For example, in the case of 生 まれながらに, it can be translated as '(B) has existed since birth', but what it really means is that 'while being in the state of (A), (B) is still there'. Caution ながらに tends to only be used with a limited set of words, so it is best not to use it with structures that you have not already seen at some point in the past."

Like てはいけない (must not), なくてはいけない (must), and なくてはならない (must), these abbreviation forms can be followed by いけない , ならない , or だめ. However, they are usually omitted, without changing the meaning. Structures like this are referred to as spoken/colloquial language . These casual variations can come across in a very similar way to words like 'gotta' in English. In these examples, a variety of forms have been used naturally. There is no 'most natural' form, and it will often depend on the speaker as to which they choose. As with almost all grammatical structures, the shortest variations (not including いけない , etc.) are the most casual/used the most often. There are several other ways that these common abbreviations can appear based on region, or even an individual speaker's preference. An example of this is なけりゃ, which is a (very) casual form of なければ . In this example, we can see that some of these less common variations are used specifically by certain genders (in general). なけりゃ itself tends to be used by male speakers, and may be considered a bit rougher than なきゃ , or なくちゃ , which can be used by anybody."

This results in the same 'and' meaning as the standard て form, but with the negative meaning of ない. なくて can be translated as 'to not (A), and…', or 'not (A), and…', depending on what type of word it is used with. As discussed in our initial lesson about ない, there are two forms of this particular word. One form is an auxiliary verb, and is used with verbs. The other form of ない is an い-Adjective ( 形容詞 ), and is used with nouns, な-Adjectives , and い-Adjectives . The difference between these two, is that the い-Adjective form may have は in between it and the word it is connected to ( では in the case of nouns and な-Adjectives ). With verbs, due to ない being an auxiliary verb , this is not possible. Caution なくて is very similar to ないで , another structure that is regularly used with verbs (but may not be used with nouns or adjectives). ないで is far more common when expressing 'not doing' something, while なくて tends to be used almost exclusively for expressing reasons/causes."

However, it is important to remember that this is actually a double negative, and therefore means 'If (A) is not done, it cannot become', or more simply '(A) cannot not be done'. To make this construction, the auxiliary verb ない will need to be conjugated with ば , creating なければ (if not). After this, ならない (to not become) will be added to the end. As we learned in the なきゃ lesson, なければ may be shortened to なきゃ . This structure is frequently used, either with or without the added ならない . Caution While いけない (to not be able to go) and ならない (to not become) are quite similar, ならない will rarely be used outside of formal situations, or in writing. Due to this, いけない will be heard much more frequently in speech (when it is not omitted)."

Essentially, it is a way to highlight that a 'because' is coming at the end of the sentence, drawing attention to it. なぜなら itself is a conjunction that is a combination of the adverb , なぜ 'why', and the hypothetical form of だ , なら . Literally, なぜなら～から is similar to 'why is (A) so, (B) is the cause'. This sounds quite dramatic in English, but is a perfectly natural way of emphasizing a statement/fact in Japanese. To use なぜなら～から , state that fact/important piece of information as (A). Then, at the beginning of a new sentence, なぜなら will be followed by the reason/cause, with から finishing the sentence. The primary function of なぜなら in Japanese (as opposed to simply using から or ので by itself) is to gain the attention of the listener, and inform them that important information is coming."

This is considered to be an abbreviation of ならば , the hypothetical form of なり, a classical auxiliary verb that is not used much in modern Japanese. Because なり originally meant 'to be', it functions in a similar way to the auxiliary verb だ . This means that it regularly pairs with nouns, or phrases that have been nominalized (become noun-like), through the use of の . However, unlike だ (or です ), なら is also regularly used without the extra help of の for nominalization, and can be attached directly to verbs or い-Adjectives . Caution Because なら is an abbreviation of ならば , it is strictly used when making guesses about what 'may', or what 'could' happen in certain situations. This means that it will not be used as 'if' in statements about results that are produced through some sort of effort/training. Fun Fact Although なら comes from the classical auxiliary verb なり, it should not be confused with the particle なり, which often has the meaning of 'as soon as', or 'just after'. Thankfully, the particle なり is also quite uncommon in modern Japanese."

They are thought to have overlapping meanings in many circumstances, and なんか itself may be considered an adverbial particle . なんて is an extension of this, and may be considered an abbreviation of などという 'to say something like'. Both なんか and なんて are used in the same way as など , having translations like 'such as', and 'things like' in English. The primary difference between なんか and なんて is that なんて is far more common after 用言 (conjugatable words). This includes verbs, い-Adjectives , and な-Adjectives . On the other hand, なんか is almost exclusively used after 体言 (unconjugatable words). In other words, nouns. Despite the 体言 and 用言 tendency, most native speakers will not consider it incorrect to use either なんか or なんて with any type of word. Fun Fact Both なんか and なんて are often used to show a low evaluation of the word that they follow. This can come across as humility when used in relation to oneself, or as an insult when used in relation to others. Don't let this point stop you from using なんか or なんて though, as many native speakers use it simply to fill the silence in modern Japanese."

                        "content": "In Japanese, the vast majority of な-Adjectives are originally nouns, and differ from nouns only in that they have their own set of conjugation rules. The dictionary form of a な-Adjective will always be followed by だ . な is only attached when describing another noun. As we can see from these examples, だ or です is required at the end of a sentence, but な will be required when using a な-Adjective to describe a noun. な-Adjectives are mostly words of foreign (Chinese/English) origin. This is why they have evolved to require unique conjugation rules. Fun Fact As a learner, it can be very difficult to identify what a な-Adjective is, compared to a regular noun. Nouns conjugate with の , while な-Adjectives conjugate with な. A very simple trick that Japanese children learn is using the adverb とても 'very'. If とても sounds natural with a word, then it is probably a な-Adjective , if it sounds unnatural, then the word is likely to be a regular noun. From this example, we can see that とても can be used to help identify な-Adjectives . Basically, this is due to adjectives being measurable 'very big', 'very small', while nouns are not measurable 'very dog', 'very boat'."

(A) will always represent the verb that comes before にくい . The nuance of にくい is that (A) is a task that is difficult to do, because of the required skill level, or similar factors. This is different from づらい, which focuses more on a task that is difficult due to being unbearable/hard to endure for some reason. Fun Fact An easy way to remember the difference in nuance between にくい and づらい, is that にくい comes from the same kanji as 難 しい, which usually carries the meaning of 'difficulty' (in relation to skill being required)."

In this way, (B) generally describes something that either does or does not fulfill the expectations of (A), and perhaps why.

Basically, this changes the adjective into an adverb, and then uses する to show that the adjective itself is the thing that is being done. Fun Fact にする is one of four regularly repeating grammar patterns in Japanese that highlight the level of control that the speaker has over the action/result of an action. From highest to lowest level of control, these are as follows: にする - High level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action themselves. になる - High level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action themselves, but there is no external target. とする - Medium level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action, but some outside factors may need to be considered (difficulty, other people, time, etc.). となる - Low level of control, the speaker/subject has almost no control over these actions, and something that came about purely due to external factors is being discussed."

However, the particular meaning conveyed here will be closer to 'due to (A), (B)', 'on account of (A), (B)', or 'for each (A), (B)'. につき will follow nouns directly, before the (B) part of the sentence describes what is happening 'due to' or 'on account of (A)'. This grammar point is quite formal, so it is often seen in formal documents, announcements, and notifications. Regardless of the several common English translations, the base meaning of 'to affix to (A)' is kept in all of the uses of につき , as it simply implies that (B) is in answer to, exists in a way that is directly linked to, suitable for, or caused by (A)."

This is a combination of the case marking particle に, the adverbial particle は, and the negative form of the う-Verb 当 たる 'to strike', or 'to be on the mark', 当 たらない. Due to this, the literal meaning can be thought of as 'it's not on the mark to (A)'. には 当 たらない will appear directly after verbs in their dictionary form , or する verbs either with or without the する. Additionally, the は may occasionally be omitted, without any change in meaning. Rather than implying that something is 'way off', には 当 たらない most often simply highlights that a particular situation is not to the extent where (A) would be appropriate. (A) itself is regularly a verb that relates to reactions or feelings. Some examples include 驚 く 'to be surprised', 非難 'to reproach', 称賛 'to admire', 感心 'to be impressed', 喜 ぶ 'to rejoice', and other similar words."

It is usually translated as 'surrounding (A)', 'associated with (A)', or 'connected to (A)'. In most cases, まつわる will be both preceded and followed by a noun, with the preceding noun being the topic, and the following noun being the thing that is dealing with that topic. まつわる itself is primarily seen when (B) is some sort of information or explanation related to (A). Because of this, 話 'tale', 物語 'story', 伝説 'legend', 神話 'myth', and similar words will often appear as (B). Fun Fact 纏 わる shares the same kanji as 纏 まる, another common verb that means 'to come together', or 'to consolidate'. Although the kanji itself is rarely used outside of books, it may help to remember the nuance being conveyed in まつわる of 'coming together'. This 'coming together around (A)', or simply 'surrounding (A)' translates the feeling of the structure quite accurately."

Being that it is composed of the case-marking particle に, adverbial particle も, the noun 程 'bounds', and がある 'to have', the more literal meaning of 'there are bounds even within (A)' also carries the critical nuance of the more standard translations.

Caution Despite being used negatively in the vast majority of situations, there are instances where にも 程 がある will be used positively with adjectives such as かわいい 'cute' or うまい 'delicious'.

                        "content": "によると , a combination of the case marking particle に , the う - Verb よる, and the conjunction particle と, is a phrase that is used to express that something is 'according to (A)', or 'going off (A)'. In these cases, (A) is considered to be the source of some form of information which will be conveyed in the (B) part of the sentence. This expression will be used after nouns, or with verbs that have been paired with ところ (to indicate the 'place' where the information came from). In newspapers and in articles, the more formal によりますと variant can also regularly be seen. However, this structure is not limited to using と, and the same meaning can be conveyed with with によれば . This is just よる in its conjunctive form that pairs with the conjunction particle ば . Caution Although によると and によれば are largely interchangeable, によると will convey a higher level of 'certainty', or 'reliability' in regard to the source of information. Due to this, によると is more likely to be used when referring to legitimate sources (police, news, etc). Fun Fact よる is almost always written in hiragana alone. However, there are several different kanji that can be used to represent this verb. Each of these kanji have slightly different nuances, but they generally all represent the same 'base' meaning. This meaning is that '(B)'s foundation is (A)'. The most common kanji used for よる are as follows: 依 る - (B) depends on (A). 拠 る - (B) extends from (A). 因 る - (B) results from (A). 由 る - (B) is due to (A)."

It may be interpreted as 'before (A), (B)', 'prior to (A), (B)', or 'in preference over (A), (B)'. Despite these several interpretations, the literal meaning of 'standing before (A), (B)' can be useful to remember, as it highlights the importance of (B) as a first step. As 先立 つ is a verb, it may be seen in its dictionary from when followed directly by another noun, or in its て-form when indicating the whole (B) phrase as preceding (A). Additionally, the formal-conjunctive form, 先立 ち will often be used in preference of the て-form, as に 先立 つ is a formal grammar structure. Fun-fact 先立 つ may often be seen paired with 物 , and is a set expression in these cases that translates similarly to 'means' in English. This 'means' refers to the prerequisites required to enable something, and will usually appear in negative sentences, in order to show that one 'does not have the means to do (A)'."

This is just a combination of the noun 気 , を, and the る-Verb 付 ける 'to adhere', or 'to attach'. 気 を 付 ける primarily follows (A) に. This marks (A) as something that the speaker is 'adhering' their attention to, and translates as 'to pay attention to (A)', 'to be careful of (A)', or 'to watch out for (A)'. This grammar pattern is used after nouns or noun-like phrases, indicating the thing that is being warned about, or that the speaker themselves is being cautious of. Most often, 気 を 付 ける will be used to warn about possible errors that could be made, mistakes, or simply the loss of focus. Due to this, it frequently follows negative verbs as ないよう, highlighting that something should be done in a 'manner' that doesn't result in (A)."

This verb is seen in several different grammar structures that all basically highlight that some extreme or unexpected extent is being reached. When paired with に and まで, に 至 るまで is often interpreted as 'everything from (A) to (B)'. Comparative statements such as から or より frequently come directly after (A), while に 至 るまで will come directly after (B). This marks (B) as the 'extreme' extent. Both (A) and (B) will either be nouns or noun phrases. The 'to reach a climax' meaning of 至 る itself can be used as an indicator that grammar points that use this verb all indicate some kind of exceptionally wide range between (A) and (B). Due to this, 至 るまで can be thought of as simply a strong emphasis of まで by itself, which also marks an extent."

Depending on the particular nuance that is being used, common translations include 'particularly when (A), (B)', 'those who (A), (B)', and 'only when (A), (B)'. This structure is comprised of に, and the て-form of the う-Verb 限 る 'to limit'. Let's look at a few examples of each potential meaning. First, when something about (A) is unbelievable due to what is either expected or previously known. Second, when something is limited to (A). Third, when (B) is true in most cases concerning (A).

This adjective will be used in the negative, in order to indicate that something is 'not difficult'. The case-marking particle に at the beginning is limited to following verbs that indicate thinking or conjecture. This structure will only appear with quite a limited number of verbs, with 想像 'to imagine', 予想 'to predict', 察 する 'to infer' or 'to sense', 理解 'to understand', and 推測 'to guess' making up the majority of them. Fun Fact Many words have alternative forms that will be described as (A) の 改 まった 表現 'the reformed version of (A)' in Japanese dictionaries. Although the standard meaning of the る-Verb 改 まる is 'to redo', it can also often be 'to reform' in the sense of making something ceremonious or formal. (A) will usually be the far more common or everyday version of a word, such as with 難 しい in the case of this grammar point."

However, the meaning is the same as the modern なければ  'if not (A)'. ねば connects to verbs in the same way as ない, and will then be followed by the negative form of なる 'to become', ならない. Like なければならない , ねばならない will translate to 'must do (A)', or 'have to do (A)', and is simply a double negative that literally means 'if not (A), it won't be (B)'. This is a formal structure, and will mostly be found in literature. As ね is a form of the literary auxiliary verb ず, the base of する will change to せねば, in the same way it changes to せず in other grammar patterns. Caution Sometimes ならない will be replaced with ならぬ. This has exactly the same meaning and just makes use of the ぬ attributive form of the same auxiliary verb ,  ず. While not changing the meaning at all, the addition of ぬ will make the overall expression sound even more old-fashioned. Fun-fact As with other 'must' double-negative structures, the second part of the ねばならない may sometimes be omitted, resulting in ねば or せねば appearing by itself. This is similar to the modern ないと appearing without いけない following it."

It can be used to show that something is the opposite of what is expected for (A) (translated as 'despite'), or it can be used to show that something is required for (A) to be realized (translated as 'in order to'). We will focus on the 'in order to' meaning in this lesson. To use のに , simply attach it to the base (non-past) form of a verb that you would like to express as being the 'goal', before following it with the conditions required to meet that goal. Fun Fact Although のに can be translated as 'despite', or 'in order to', it actually has the same meaning in each of these situations. の nominalizes what comes before it (turning it into a noun-phrase), while に converts that new noun-phrase into a 'location', or 'goal'. In this way, のに always means 'to that which is (A), (B)'."

In many cases, the interpretation will be 'it may well be (A)', 'it's only natural that (A)', or 'there's no wonder that (A)'. However, 尤 も itself is simply an adjective that affirms that the speaker understands the thought process behind (A), and that it is logical to them, regardless of whether or not they actually agree with it themselves. Due to this, 'it may well be (A)' in English is actually a very close translation of the feeling behind the expression. のももっともだ will appear with verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, and nouns. In the case of nouns, the の will be dropped, as the noun itself will become the expression being marked as the focus. Due to のももっともだ being used when the speaker is expressing that they understand the underlying reasons behind something, phrases used for explanation such as から or ので will often be seen in the same sentence."

Therefore, it is also often used to describe the observer's impression of who they are looking at, in regard to their presence, or lack thereof. Caution After nouns, の will sometimes be omitted, but this is not always the case. In general, の may be dropped after kanji compounds, but not after simple words like 人 , 時 , 元 , etc."

This is achieved through the use of the particle の , in a similar way to its standard possessive use. The noun that would usually follow の is dropped, as it has either been said earlier in the sentence, or is understood clearly from context. In these examples, it would also be grammatically correct to use the same noun following の , but as can be seen in the English translation, it results in unnecessary repetition. This is called word stacking/redundant words ( 重 ね 言葉 ) in Japanese, and is considered a poor writing/speech habit. Despite this, it is important to know that this の is exactly the same as the possessive の (with the following word simply being left out). In the following sentence, we can see another common use of の that translates similarly to 'one' in English, when referring to non-specific things. From this, it is clear that the repeated noun is not needed. Japanese is a language that avoids repeating words in many situations. This example shows noun replacement, rather than noun omission, another common use of の which we will cover in another lesson."

This structure will be used when the speaker wants to change the topic from (A) to (B), or mention (B) as being something additional on top of (A). はともかく is primarily seen following nouns in their dictionary forms. In many cases, this will be when (A) is something that the speaker thinks is not worth considering, or not worth making an issue out of when (B) is more important. Fun-fact The adverb 兎 も 角 is thought to have come from the Buddhist expression 兎角亀毛 , meaning 'horns on rabbits, fur on turtles', referring to things that do not exist. Although this particular meaning is not widely accepted as being strongly related to the modern meaning of 兎 も 角 , some relation can be drawn between it and English phrases such as '(A) is neither here nor there' in reference to something that is non-existent, or of little importance."

It may also imply that (A) is happening 'more and more', or that 'it keeps on (A)'. This phrase utilizes ばかり's standard meaning of 'only', and combines it with the auxiliary verb だ (or です ). As can be seen with these sentences, this use of ばかり is paired almost exclusively with verbs that describe some form of change (higher/lower, stronger/weaker, better/worse, faster/slower, etc). If the speaker would like to express further information in a (B) part of the sentence, だ will simply get changed to its conjunctive form で, before continuing. Caution This use of ばかり is primarily seen with negative trends. However, this is not a grammatical rule, and positive trends may also sometimes appear with ばかりだ."

This will be translated as 'for the purpose of (A), (B)', 'in order to (A), (B)', or 'to ensure that (A), (B)'. べく itself will only attach to verbs that can be done intentionally, with some purpose in mind. The (B) part of べく sentences will also indicate an intentional action that will be performed in order to reach the goal of (A). When combining する with べく , due to べく being a classical auxiliary verb , it will attach to the classical stem of する, す. However, in modern Japanese it is fairly common to see both すべく and するべく , with both forms being considered correct. べく itself is a very formal structure in modern Japanese, so will rarely be used in standard speech. Fun Fact Although べし and all of its conjugations have slightly different translations based on the grammar points that they appear in, the underlying meaning can be stemmed from the originating kanji 可 し, meaning 'to be permissible'. The focus with this kanji and all forms of べし are just that the word it is attached to is being marked as a strong goal. This means that rather than 'in order to (A)', べく is closer to 'to attain (A)', in that it adds further emphasis."

Due to this, it is usually translated as 'so much that (A)', or 'to the extent that (A)'. ほど can be added on to the end of the attributive form of any word. The attributive form being the form that is able to be partnered directly with nouns. Caution Although くらい may be used to describe something that is 'around' a certain extent (regardless of whether it is above or below that extent), 程 refers specifically to the 'limit' of something, and therefore cannot be used to describe something that exceeds the stated limit. Due to this, it is regularly used to express some sort of exaggerated limit of (A), when the real extent is far below that."

Although slightly different in nuance, まじき is often translated simply as 'not proper for (A)', or 'unbecoming of (A)' in each case. The most common pattern that まじき will be seen in is (A) にあるまじき (B), where the case-marking particle に follows a noun, then is linked to the う-Verb ある, before まじき will connect to a second noun. Occasionally, に will be replaced by として 'as', with the rest of the structure remaining the same. 許 すまじき 'must not be forgiven', or simply 'unforgivable' is another pattern that may be seen."

This may seem confusing at first, but it may be easier to think of また as meaning 'repetition of (A)', where (A) is any particular course of action. This repetition is a bit different to English, in that it can express the same action, or an alternative option. また can be used as an adverb , or as a conjunction . In this lesson, we will focus on its use as a conjunction. As with many other conjunctions in Japanese, a phrase/sentence can begin with また , so long as that sentence expresses a complete thought. Due to また being quite different to any single word that we have in English, let's try to make the meaning a bit clearer. Imagine that '(A) action always has (B) result'. However, the action which leads to the (B) result could be many different things. Because of this, また can have the following meanings. The same (A) action is taken - Has the nuance of 'again', or 'moreover'. A different (A) action is taken - Has the nuance of 'also', and 'additionally'."

However, a more literal translation of 'it is not so far as to (A)' is also completely acceptable, and still carries the correct nuance. までもない will be used following verbs in their dictionary form , and may or may not have a part (B) explaining why (A) is not necessary. As can be assumed by the use of まで, the primary nuance of までもない is that while there may be some sort of slight issue or problem, the speaker does not consider it as being something that has reached a point that is worth being concerned about. It may also indicate that because something is obvious, it does not need to be confirmed, etc. Caution When coming between an (A) and a (B) phrase, the conjunctive form までもなく will be used, but this is less common."

As むしろ seeks to give a more accurate description about something, it will often be paired with grammar patterns such as より, to show where the comparison is being made. Fun Fact むしろ comes from the kanji 寧 ろ, literally meaning 'preferable'. This is the same kanji that appears in the word 丁寧 , meaning 'polite' (sometimes also translated as 'careful'). The grammar structure むしろ itself may even be translated as 'preferably', simply expressing that careful consideration has been given to describing something accurately."

This structure is seen with verbs, い-Adjectives, and な-Adjectives followed by の, but may also follow nouns without the addition of の. Occasionally, にも may be used instead of も for further emphasis. も 構 わず is used most frequently to express that (A) is something that is either being ignored or that the speaker is not worried about. The (B) part of the statement will regularly highlight something that is being without any consideration for (A). This comes from the standard 'to brace', or 'to give pause' meaning of 構 う."

Common translations include ‘If you were to (A), (B)’, of ‘if (A) happens, (B)’. In this particular use of ものなら , (A) will be a verb in its volitional form, and (B) will be some sort of negative result that would come about from that. Let’s have a look at a few examples. Keeping in mind that the volitional form can mean to approach an action with reckless abandon, it can be thought of as being similar to the English ‘to go and do (A)’, where the ‘to go and’ just indicates proceeding ahead without carefully considering the outcome. Fun Fact なら is often translated as ‘if’ in many textbooks and online resources, but knowing that it is just a conjugation of だ ‘is’, the more literal translation is ‘were’. This ‘were’ behaves exactly the same way in English in hypothetical situations, so may potentially be better if you would like to avoid confusion between other ‘if’ grammar patterns like ば, と, and たら. An example of this can be seen in sentences like ‘were it to rain tomorrow, then I would need an umbrella’. Because of this, it is recommended to memorize なら purely as ‘were’, rather than the ‘if’ interpretation that is usually attached to it."

However, unlike くれる and あげる (which are used to highlight that something is 'given'), もらう requires the に particle (or から ) to mark the giver, not the recipient. が or は may be used to mark the recipient, as they are the one performing the action of receiving. を will mark the object that is being given. In the second sentence we can see that the recipient has been omitted, while in the third example, the giver was omitted. This is a regular occurrence when using もらう , as the receiver is usually obvious, or the 'giver' may not be important to the overall meaning of the sentence. In this example, the thing that was given is the focus, while the speaker does not consider the 'giver' something that needs to be mentioned. Sometimes, for very simple sentences with clear context, neither the 'giver', nor the 'receiver' needs to be mentioned."

This included things such as 'namely', 'immediately', 'in a moment', and others. All of these meanings simply hinted at the fact that the expression following やがて was already expected or known."

However, 'consequently to (A)', or 'as a consequence of (A)' are also completely acceptable translations that may help to differentiate ゆえに from less formal structures. As ゆえ itself is a noun, regular grammar rules such as being preceded by の will need to be followed if directly following another noun. In other cases, ゆえに will simply attach to the standard form of words. ゆえに may also appear at the beginning of new sentences. When this happens, it expresses 'as a result of (A)', where (A) is the entire previous sentence. The に will need to be replaced with の when ゆえ is being connected to another noun and therefore modifying it. Caution Just like 'as a consequence of' in English, ゆえに tends to be used far more frequently in regard to negative reasons than positive ones."

                        "content": "As we have seen several times now, the auxiliary verb ようだ is frequently used with verbs, to express that the 'completion' of an action is the specific goal/wish of the speaker. It does this implicitly through the meaning of the kanji 様 'manner of doing'. ようにいのる (or 祈 る in its kanji form) is no different, and will imply that the speaker is praying for (A) to be done/completed. This comes from the meaning of the う-Verb 祈 る itself, which can be translated as 'to pray', or 'to beg'. Despite being able to be used when actually praying, this grammar point is used most often to express a 'hope'. In a similar way to other ように structures, ないように may also be used with 祈 る, to show that someone is praying for something 'not' to happen. Caution However, 'unlike' other ように structures, ように 祈 る will sometimes be shortened to ように by itself. This is especially true after ます. This is the only ように structure that will have the verb that comes after it omitted. Therefore, ように (by itself) will always mean 'to hope for', and should not be confused with ようにする , ようになる , ようにいう , and other similar grammar points. Fun Fact といい is also used to express 'to hope for (A)', or 'to wish for (A)'. However, unlike ように 祈 る , the person that the speaker is praying for with といい will mainly be determined by the use of ね (praying for someone else), or な (praying for themselves)."

As ようだ is being linked to a verb which comes later in the sentence, it will take on the adverbial form ように . This expression is used to highlight that you (or someone else) want someone to do something 'in the way of (A)'. Note that when ように follows a noun, の will be required. Either に or が may mark the thing that the speaker 'wants' to do. It is more common for に to be used to mark people, while が will often mark events/objects. Fun Fact Sometimes が and に will be switched, if either of those particles have already been used somewhere else in a sentence. This is mainly to avoid sounding repetitive, or confusion about what the subject of the sentence is."

Due to this, 予定 is used far more frequently for things that you have formal plans to do (like meeting a friend for lunch). To use 予定 , just attach it to the non-past form of a verb, or to a noun (after inserting の ). Caution If だ or です is not added after 予定 , it will imply that 予定 is simply modifying the verb/noun that comes before it, rather than being a standalone 'plan'. This is similar to the difference between saying something like 'I have plans to eat with a friend' (natural), vs 'I have an eating with a friend plan' (unnatural)."

However, in this lesson, we will take a look at how this case marking particle can be used by itself. When used alone, this particle expresses that (A) (a noun or verb) is being compared to (B) (a noun or verb that is regularly paired with an adjective). The word that より is directly attached to will always be 'less than' the comparison being made. However, the overall expression is used to describe that (B) is 'more' (something) than (A). Caution In many textbooks, より is taught as meaning 'more', but the word that より is attached to will actually be the thing that is 'less' (something). The word/quote that has が attached to it will be the thing that is 'more' (adjective). This is particularly confusing when より is not directly attached to a word, something which is common in casual spoken language. In this sentence, because the が is attached to これ , これ is the thing that is 'more expensive'. As より is not actually directly connected to any other word, it therefore means that これ is expensive, compared to 'other things'. When you see より like this, just pretend that it says 'other things' before it."

Due to this, ら is often called a 'pluralizing suffix'. ら comes from the same kanji as 等 , and the literal meaning is closer to '(A) etc'. This 'etc' is where the implication of 'more than one' originates. To use ら , attach it to the end of any pronoun. Caution Because ら has a literal meaning that is close to '(A) etc', or '(A) and so on', it may sometimes be considered a bit rude (due to being dismissive). Because of this, it is recommended to not use this suffix in relation to people, unless it is absolutely essential to indicate plural. In most cases, 達 will be a far better choice."

This pattern simply involves the replacement of る with another construction, depending on the tense of the verb ( past , negative , etc). This conjugation pattern that only includes る is where the Japanese name Ichidan ( 一段 ) 'one-level' comes from. In these examples, we can see that る is removed from the verb to create the polite ます form. The る form of the verb is often called 'plain form', 'casual form', or 'short form', depending on the source/book. All る-Verbs end in the kana る, there are no exceptions to this rule. Caution While all る-Verbs end in る, not all verbs that end in る are る-Verbs . These verbs can be identified by the る changing, rather than being removed when conjugated. As the る in 取 る becomes り in 取 ります, we can determine immediately that it is not a る-Verb , but actually a う-Verb ."

Naturally, this determination may sometimes be negative, as is the case with わけではない. ではない being the conjugated form of the auxiliary verb だ , the adverbial particle は, and the い-Adjective ない. わけではない may be translated as 'it doesn't mean that (A)', or 'it's not the case that (A)'. Although, 'it is not necessarily so that it's (A)', or 'so it's not (A)' are closer to the actual nuance of わけ. わけではない can be used at the end of any sentence, so long as the word before わけ is in attributive form . As always, では may be replaced by じゃ. Fun Fact わけだ and わけではない match the explanatory meaning of 'so' in English that often replaces words like 'because' and 'since'. However, as we will examine in more detail in the わけがない grammar point, わけ also matches the emphatic nuance of 'so', as can be seen in statements like 'it's SO not (A)'."

                        "content": "As mentioned in the わ grammar point, わ is an adverbial particle that is commonly used in cases of stress of emphasis in Japanese. When used after either verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns in their standard forms , it generally implies that (A) and (B) are negative factors that have lead to (C), where (C) is either a negative outcome, or a negative opinion. It will often be translated simply as 'with (A) and (B), (C)'. To use this structure, simply place わ after a word, and then repeat the same after a second (different) word. In the case of な-Adjective or nouns, だわ will be used. The case-marking particle で will then follow the second わ, indicating 'with', or 'as a consequence of'. わ～わで , like わ , primarily emphasizes the speaker's surprise in regard to the words that appear before it. However, unlike わ , where the same verb will be repeated in order to highlight an excessive extent, わ～わで simply indicates surprise in terms of irritation or frustration. This structure is predominantly used by men, but it may also sometimes be used by women. However, there are several different variations of わ depending on where they appear in sentences, each of which have gender usage tendencies that will need to be learned. In essence, わ is used in the same way as し～し, where the words that they are being attached to are just being listed as reasons. Additionally, the で may occasionally be omitted. Fun Fact わ is simply an emphatic version of the usual は adverbial particle , and originates from は being changed to わ. Due to this, the literal meaning can be thought of as a stronger version of the standard 'as for (A)' meaning of は. Caution While this grammar pattern is used almost exclusively with a negative nuance, it may, in rare cases, have a positive nuance."

It may be translated as 'ignoring (A)', or 'disregarding (A)'. It is a combination of the adverbial particle を, the noun 余所 'other place', and the case-marking particle に.

It is reasonably formal, so will be seen more often in writing.

Because of this, it is often used critically about actions that are seen as irresponsible.

Its component parts are the adverbial particle を, the noun 余儀 'another method', the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective ない, なく, and the passive form of する, される. In this way, it literally means 'to not be given another way than to (A)'. を 余儀 なくされる will be seen following an (A) noun, where (A) is the thing that is unavoidable. In most cases, the subject of sentences that use を 余儀 なくされる will be a person, or something that is representative of people, such as a company. However, there are exceptions to this. Caution Both を 余儀 なくされる 'to be forced to do' and を 余儀 なくさせる 'to force to do' are variations of the same grammar structure. を 余儀 なくさせる will be taught in a different lesson. Fun Fact Despite 余儀 and ない being separate words, 余儀 なく is often thought of simply as a single word that means 'unavoidably', or 'inevitably'."

Primarily, they can be thought of as meaning 'through (A), (B)', or 'via (A), (B)'. This 'through' may either indicate a method, or a location. 通 じる 'to flow', or 'to go through' and 通 す 'to make a path', only differ in that the former is intransitive, while the latter is transitive. Because of this, 通 じる will be seen more often in regard to information or communication where (A) is the connection through which (B) occurs. 通 す on the other hand more often refers to direct locations through which something is transferred or relocated. As this expression begins with を, it will appear after nouns, before expressing in the (B) part of the sentence exactly what was done 'through' (A). Caution The primary difference between を 通 じて and を 通 して lies in the intransitive and transitive nature of the verbs themselves. Due to this, things that are being done 'intentionally', or 'by use of (A)' will tend to use を 通 して . を 通 じて is more common when something is being done 'throughout (A)'."

This means that the subject (the person or thing performing an action) is performing that action with the object being the goal/target of the action. In most cases, whatever を is attached to will not actually be 'doing' anything, but will instead have something being done to it. In these sentences, を is marking the thing that is having an action performed 'on' it. This is how the Japanese language views the ' object '. However, unlike English, an object can also be a place in which an action is performed 'through', if the goal of that action is based in that location itself. In these sentences, を is marking the place 'through' which the action is taking place. This use of を highlights that the place itself is what is being interacted with (running/walking requires interaction with the ground, so the ground/place is the object)."

In these meanings, (B) will always be something that is deemed as either obvious or necessary. 上 in this phrase is a noun , and will be attached to the adverbial particle は. This creates a literal meaning that is similar to 'over and above (A), (B)'. This 'over and above' has a similar nuance to 'with that said', or 'all things considered' in English, and just presents (A) as something that is finalized. This structure follows verbs in the standard form . Due to 上 は being quite old-fashioned, expressions like からには or 以上 は will be heard more frequently in modern-day Japanese, and will carry a similar meaning."

                        "content": "As a suffix , 中 is frequently used to highlight a period of time (or space). By attaching the case marking particle に , the sentence can be modified, to show that (B) is happening/existing throughout the timeframe/space of (A). This is often translated as 'throughout (A), (B)', or 'during (A), (B)'. First, let's take a look at 中 being used to show events that are in process. Now, to show that a (B) event is happening within (A), simply add the case marking particle に to show a 'temporal location'. This will be done by attaching に to the end of any noun that you would like to indicate as the being the 'space' within which another thing exists/occurs. In these examples, we can see that 中 に is sometimes read/said as 中 に. The basic rule for when to use ちゅう or when to use じゅう is as follows: 中 に - Expresses a very specific (usually small) amount of time/space, or something that is not always the same (an amount of time/space that can change, depending on the person/situation). This 'thing' that ちゅう highlights is usually a 'process', and therefore means that (A) is 'in the process' of happening. Examples - A meeting, class, visit to somewhere. 中 に - Expresses a predetermined amount of time/space that will always remain the same, regardless of the person/situation. Therefore, じゅう does not highlight a 'process', but focuses on the 'length' or 'space' itself. This tends to mean 'all throughout', as it focuses on the full amount of time/space. Examples - A day, year, house, town or country. Caution There is also a difference between 音読 み (chinese readings of words), and 訓読 み (japanese readings of words). じゅう is used more frequently with 訓読 み - ( 今年中 , 夏休 み 中 , 今晩中 ). ちゅう is used more frequently with 音読 み - ( 水中 , 会議中 , 試合中 )."

Being a combination of the noun 傾向 'inclination', and がある 'to have', the literal meaning is almost identical to the standard English interpretation. As 傾向 itself is a noun, this structure may appear after verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives followed by な, and nouns followed by の. Although がある is the most frequent structure seen with 傾向 , alternatives such as が 見 られる 'the trend of (A) can be observed' are also widely used. It should also be noted that 傾向 がある may be used both in instances where the trend is either positive or negative. Caution 傾向 がある tends to express behaviors or characteristics (static things that aren't actively changing), while 傾向 にある focuses more on being in a state of something that is ongoing or proceeding in a certain direction, such as a declining trend."

Due to this, 切 る is often translated as 'to do (A) to the point of being unable to continue' (or not needing to continue), or 'to totally and utterly do (A)'. Occasionally, 切 る may also be used to show that (A) is being done at 'full pelt', 'full steam', or 'full capacity'. In these cases, it is similar to 'to resolutely do (A)', and just means that 100% effort is being put into the action."

This word is often attached to the end of other nouns, in order to show that something is 'facing (A)', or 'suitable for (A)'. Due to 向 き being intransitive, it usually implies that something is facing toward (A) naturally, or through chance. Because of this, it may convey that something is 'suitable for (A)', but not necessarily designed specifically for it. Caution 向 け, coming from the transitive verb 向 ける is used far more often to express that something has been specifically designed for (A). When comparing 向 き and 向 け, the primary difference is that 向 き conveys that something is 'appropriate for (A)', while 向 け is closer to 'intended for (A)'."

Just like よう, ごとし (written primarily in hiragana) focuses on the appearance of (A) based on observation. Due to this, ごとし may be translated as 'like (A)', 'similar to (A)', or 'as if it were (A)'. ごとし is the base form of this auxiliary verb , but ごとく (the conjunctive form ), and ごとき (the attributive form ) will also be seen. As only ごとき is attributive, it may be followed directly by other nouns, while ごとし most often comes at the end of sentences. ごとく acts as an adverb when preceding verbs, but may also be seen before breaks in clauses. Let's look at a few examples of each form. Like よう, ごとし and its variations will follow の when coming after a noun. However, it will follow が when coming after a verb. As ごとし is old-fashioned, it will primarily be encountered in books, rather than in speech. Fun Fact The kanji 如 itself has a meaning very similar to the word 'likeness' in English, indicating something that resembles (A) in every sense of the word, but is not actually (A). This kanji can be seen in several common words in Japanese such as 如何 'how'."

When attached to the conjunctive form of verbs, it takes on the nuance of 'for (A) to be possible', or 'to be able to (A)'. Compared to できる, meaning that the potential to do something exists. 得 る means something closer to 'there is a possibility that (A) can be done', or 'the possibility to do (A) has been gained'. Caution 得 る may be seen as either える or うる. The primary difference between the two being that うる is a relatively old form that is often seen in literature, and spoken far less frequently than える. Despite this, there is a tendency for うる to be the preferred spoken choice when the kana that appears before it is え, such as 教 える becoming 教 え うる , rather than 教 え える . Fun Fact 得 る is far more formal/bookish than できる. However, there are several set phrases that are very common in daily speech that use this particular grammar point, such as あり 得 る 'possible', and あり 得 ない 'impossible'."

Regarding verbs, it expresses 'going forward from (A), (B)'. This is usually in relation to something that has happened either accidentally or completely, and may represent what will be done as a result of being in that situation. This can also be interpreted as 'now that (A), (B)', and simply highlights that nothing can be done except to move on or 'forward' given the current circumstances. When 手前 appears with nouns followed by the case marking particle の, it often expresses that what is 'in front' of (A) is the reason for (B), or simply is 'in front of (B)'. Despite the many translations, 手前 always shows something that is 'facing' the noun or verb that appears with it. Due to this, thinking of this structure as similar to 'faced with (A), (B)' may be helpful, as English also expresses lack of option and finality in this way."

As the kanji 最 means 'utmost', we can see that the literal meaning is 'utmost middle'. This can be translated in a similar way to phrases like 'at the height of (A)', or 'in the midst of (A)', in English. When using 最中 に , a (B) part of the sentence will usually highlight something else that happened during (A), somehow interrupting or disturbing it. To use 最中 に , attach it to the end of the ている form of a verb, or a noun followed by の. Caution 最中 may also occasionally be used with adjectives, but this is uncommon. In these cases, the meaning is to be at the 'pinnacle' of whatever the adjective is describing (usually a feeling/emotion)."

When linked to a (B) noun, in order to show that something 'has' been made good use of, 活 かす will appear in the past tense.

As a noun, it will usually be followed by の (when connecting nouns), or by the auxiliary verb だ , when at the end of a sentence. に will often be ommited when there is no need to put specific emphasis on a time. Occasionally, まず 'first of all' will be paired with 第一 . This may seem redundant, but is like saying 'the very first' in English. Fun Fact 第 is a kanji that is often translated as 'number'. However, the literal meaning is a bit closer to 'position', as it refers to the place that something has within a sequence of numbers. As such, 第一 simply means '1st position'."

Because of this, the most common translations of this verb are 'to be audible', or 'to sound like (A)'. 聞 こえる is an intransitive verb, and literally means 'to give off sound'. When using 聞 こえる , (A) will always be followed by が . (A) is considered to be the 'source' of the sound (a noun). However, the 'way that something sounds' will be marked adverbially. This means that an い-Adjective will be changed to its く form, and な-Adjectives /nouns will be followed by に . Fun Fact The primary difference between 聞 こえる , and 聞 ける (the potential form of 聞 く), is that 聞 こえる is used to identify things that do not require the active concentration of the listener to be heard. In other words, ambient noise. However, 聞 ける is used when the speaker is trying to concentrate on some specific sound, and refers to their 'ability' to hear it."

Alternatively, 'no one', or 'nowhere' based statements are made with 誰 も , and どこも (negative sentences). Structures like this that use 誰 were briefly discussed in the 誰 grammar point. Using 誰 , or どこ is not limited to the か and も particles. へ , に , or と may also be partnered with か or も , to give a more specific meaning. As can be seen with these examples, か will always precede any other particle in a positive sentence. However, the opposite is true for も . も will always follow any other particles in negative sentences. This is because か will always attach directly to the noun (when altering the meaning of that noun), but も alters the whole phrase, not just the noun. However, It should be noted that も is not limited to appearing in negative sentences, as can be seen with the final example."

This is partly because it does not include に like other 限 る based structures, and therefore will have its meaning modified by the word that comes directly before it. 限 り will follow verbs in their standard forms, and nouns linked to である. Let's take a look at a few of the standard meanings and translations. The first meaning indicates that (B) is something that is limited to being within the scope of (A). This is the most standard meaning and can be translated as 'limited to (A), (B)'. The second meaning highlights that within the limit or scope of some particular source of information, (B) is true. This scope usually relates to the senses (like vision), or to knowledge. This may be interpreted as 'as far as (A), (B)', 'as long as (A), (B)'. The third and final meaning of 限 り will imply that 'limited to (A) being the case, (B) will occur'. In this nuance, 限 り simply implies that assuming that (A) is true, (B) is something that will need to be taken into account as well. This will be interpreted as 'while (A) is the case, (B)', or 'assuming (A), (B)'. Despite these various meanings, 限 る will always highlight (A) as the limit or constraint within which the logic of (B) exists."

When used in conjunction with the adverbial particles まで 'until', 飽 くまで can imply that (A) is 'just', 'only', or 'strictly' something. The more literal translation of 'to continue (A) to the point of getting tired of it' fits these interpretations quite well, implying that (A) will never deviate from what is being described about it. This use of 飽 くまで often appears at the beginning of a phrase, and functions adverbially. The adverbial particle も 'even' may be added for extra emphasis, but it is not required. In many cases, 飽 くまで will be used in polite sentences when the speaker is expressing their own opinion. In these cases, the nuance of 'this is merely my opinion' is conveying to the listener that the speaker realizes that what they are saying is not the only viewpoint. This way of highlighting opinions is often combined with structures like けど, or が when the speaker wants to soften their statement before offering what they think a solution might be."

In this case, する . ～ ようとしない is often translated as 'shall not (A)', but with emphasis on a lack of effort, or willingness. Caution As  ～ようとしない implies a lack of effort, this expression is usually quite negative, and mostly refers to other people, rather than the speaker themselves. If ～ようとしない were used to refer to the speaker, it will come across as 'I shall not do (A)', which would sound very abrupt/potentially rude. If speaking about yourself, ようと 思 わない may be used instead, meaning 'I don't think I shall do (A)', or 'I think I shan't do (A)'."

Building on from the adjective +て, noun + で grammar point, instead of linking adjectives, adjective + て + (B) is used for linking an adjective to an entire phrase. With this construction, the phrase is simply added after て (with い-Adjectives ), or で (with nouns and な-Adjectives ), without any extra consideration for the phrase following it (this means that the (B) phrase will behave as if it was its own sentence). As with adjective +て, noun + で , it should be noted that て and で are different structures here. て is the same conjunction particle that is used with verbs (meaning that い-Adjectives are similar to verbs), while で is actually a form of だ that is used for conjugation. It is the same で as the one that is used in the formal version of だ , である . Which we will learn later. Caution Like other て forms ( ている 1 , ている 2 , and ている 3 ), the て (or で ) form of other words can have several possible meanings. These meanings are as follows. Linking - Like 'and' in English. Reasons - Like 'with (A)', or 'because of (A)' in English. Manner - Like 'to do (B) in an (A) way' in English. Caution As with all other conjugations of いい , remember that it will be よくて, and not いくて."

                        "content": "In order to express that someone was 'made to do', or 'let do' something, the auxiliary verbs せる and させる will be used. The meaning that せる and させる will convey (when attached to a verb) is called 使役 (causative, employment, or using) in Japanese. A common misconception is that せる and させる are standard conjugations of each verb. However, these auxiliary verbs should be thought of as having their own meaning, in a similar way to how たい , ない, だ , です , and other auxiliaries each have their own meanings. In order to use these grammar structures, remove the る from る-Verbs , and then add させる . For う-Verbs , change the last kana to the あ sound kana from within the same column (except for う, which becomes わ), and then add せる (る becomes ら, む becomes ま, く becomes か, etc.). As usual, する and 来 る have special conjugation rules. する will be replaced completely by させる (in a similar way to how できる completely replaces する in the ' potential ' form). 来 る will become 来 させる . Caution With causative, either に , or を can mark the doer of the action that せる, or させる is linked to (not が). This is because the actual 'doer' of the action is considered to be the person that is making/letting someone perform that action. に will usually imply that someone was 'let' do something, while を implies 'make'. Fun Fact Because the actual 'doer' in causative verb sentences will be marked with が (as is always the case), the literal translation of せる and させる is closer to the following: (A) が (B) に 楽しま せる - For (A) to cause fun 'in' (B). (A) が (B) を 楽しま せる - For (A) to cause fun 'through' (B). It is these standard meanings of the particles に (a location) and を (a target) that will create the 'let', or 'make' nuance when using せる , or させる ."

Due to this, しか～ない is regularly translated as 'there's only (A)', or 'there's nothing but (A)'. しか～ない may be used to express numbers, or nouns. In this lesson we will examine numbers. To use this construction, the number that you want to express as being 'all that exists' will go before しか , then しか will be followed by a verb in its ない, or ありません form. Fun Fact The main difference between しか and だけ , is that だけ suggests that (A) was 'chosen' from among a group where several other choices exist. しか on the other hand, implies that there are no other choices, and (A) is the only possibility/thing that exists."

From these examples, we can see how the casual past form is constructed. In modern Japanese, simply adding です after た is considered to be the standard polite past form. Caution Although this is considered to be polite by most people, using です after かった is not academically correct Japanese. However, considering how common its usage has become, it may be used in almost any situation confidently."

                        "content": "In Japanese, there are several ways to express that something 'passively' happens. All of these are done with the auxiliary verbs れる and られる . Japanese verbs in the passive form behave in a slightly different way than they do in English, so we will examine this difference more closely later. For now, let's focus on れる , られる , and さ れる (the form used with する verbs). Passivity in Japanese means that the person (or thing) that is the target of the action will be the subject of the sentence, rather than the person that is 'doing' whatever verb is being used. You can conjugate any Japanese verb into the passive form in the following way. For う-Verbs (godan verbs), simply replace the last kana with the equivalent あ sound kana from the same row (す becomes さ, つ becomes た, ぶ becomes ば, う becomes わ, like with ない, and so on), then add れる , or られる . For る-Verbs (ichidan verbs), just replace the る with られる . する and くる behave slightly differently than most other verbs. For する , it will become さ れる , while くる will become こ られる . As can be seen in these examples, the 'doer' of the verb will be marked with に , but から can also be used in cases where there is no physical contact with the subject. Caution られる can be used in several different situations. These are listed below. Passive: 受 け 身 - Something happens to the subject as a result of an external force (sometimes sounds negative). Possible: 可能 - There is the possibility for something to be done. Spontaneous: 自発 - Something happens by itself, or 'without instigation'. Respectful: 尊敬 - You are respecting someone by making them the subject of the sentence, despite someone else actually performing the verb. Fun Fact In Japanese, passivity focuses on the lack of control of the subject of the sentence. Due to this, the subject will sometimes be called the なる人, while the doer of the verb is called the する 人. Traditionally, many textbooks use the term ' passive ', simply because there is no equivalent verb type in English ( passive is the closest). However, we would like to introduce the term 'displacement verb'. This just means that the subject of the sentence is being described in a similar way to what happens in keigo (polite speech). Caution But wait, what about れる with る-Verbs ! Well, in Japanese, ら removal words 'ラ 抜 き 言葉 ' are very common. These are words that are able to use れる , instead of られる . The original meaning of both of these auxiliary verbs is exactly the same, but there are cases where ら may not be removed. The standard rules are as follows. ら may be removed - る-Verbs and くる , when the meaning is 'possible'. ら may not be removed - る-Verbs and くる , when the meaning is 'passive', 'spontaneous', or 'respectful'. In both of these sentences, the meaning is exactly the same. However, ラ 抜 き may only be used when られる is being used to highlight ' possibility '."

This usually comes across as being a friendly way to say 'please do (A)', but may sound like a very soft order, so is best used with friends/toward people of lower status. This nuance of て is usually able to be identified by appearing at the end of a sentence. Caution Sometimes, other forms of て may appear at the end of a sentence. This happens most often when the speaker has not actually finished speaking, but is thinking about what they want to say next. In these cases, the pronunciation of て will usually be extended (to highlight that the person is thinking). When emphasizing an apology, て may also be used. For this nuance to be conveyed, て will be attached to the 'reason' that the person is apologizing, and may be either positive or negative."

This can be translated as 'I will definitely (A)', or 'I swear I will (A)', but the literal translation of 'I will show you that I'll do (A)' also makes the point clear. To use てみせる , simply alter the verb preceding it into its て-form. Due to みせる requiring a target for who the speaker is showing, this grammar pattern will only be used when there is either directly someone that will be shown (A), or when the speaker is talking about showing someone (A) that does not happen to be there at the moment either physically or temporally. It will not be used when simply strongly stating that you will do (A), unless who sees that (A) is important. In a sentence like this, where the person being shown is not obvious, it will come across as 'I'll show everyone'. As て 見 せる literally just means to 'show (A)', it will often be used without any special emphasis. Whether it is being used emphatically or not will usually be obvious from the overall context of the sentence."

Because of this, れる and られる will almost always be paired with verbs that indicate some kind of communication. As these structures are in the passive, the literal translation is close to 'to do (B) in the state that (A) was done to me'. The (B) part will come directly after ままに and simply states how someone is going to react in compliance with (A). The conjunction particle が may appear between られる and ままに, but this is not common in modern Japanese. Although it does carry the meaning of 'but', the focus is more on expressing that the (A) is not being resisted or argued with when doing (B). Caution In this grammar pattern, られる will never appear in the past-tense form."
