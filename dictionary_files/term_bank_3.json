                        "content": "あげる is a verb with many uses in Japanese. It's original meaning is 'to raise', but is also used as a polite speech way of saying 'to give'. In this way it can be thought of as similar to 'to offer up' in English. As polite speech has the same basic subject and object rules as standard speech, the giver will be marked with は or が , while the recipient will be marked with に . As usual, the 'object' that is being given will be marked with を . From these three examples, we can see that the order of 'giver', 'recipient', and 'object' does not matter, so long as the correct particles are used. Caution あげる should not be used when giving something to someone of a higher status, or when lowering oneself to elevate another. This is done through honorific language , or humble speech , and will use different verbs. Fun Fact Although あげる is considered polite speech, it is the most natural way of saying 'to give'. やる is the 'casual' equivalent of あげる , but due to やる sounding a little bit rough, あげる became the standard."

Caution Occasionally, the kanji 在 る may sometimes also be used. Although the difference between these two kanji is slight, 有 り indicates 'inclusiveness as part of a whole', while 在 り focuses more on 'stand-alone existence'."

However, its meaning is the same as the modern どう 'how'. Because of this, いかなる is interchangeable with どんな 'what kind of', with the exception that it is primarily used only in books and formal writing. いかなる is classified as being attributive, meaning that it will appear directly before a noun, or modify a noun somewhere within the same clause. Just like どんな, when に is added to いかなる , a negative statement will usually follow. This translates as 'no matter how much (A)', or 'no matter what kind of (A)'. However, に will not directly follow いかなる like it does with どんな. Instead, it will appear later in the sentence before the verb. Occasionally, いかな may also be used, but this is far less common. Fun Fact Both な and なる are derived from the classical auxiliary verb なり. Structures that stem from なり can be seen in many modern parts of the Japanese language. This also includes なら, the hypothetical form of だ, which shares the same meaning of 'to be' as なり. While な is the form that appears with most adjectival nouns, なる is still sometimes used in place of な when the speaker wants to be poetic, or give a sense of archaism."

Fun-fact いきなり comes from 行 き 成 り , but is rarely seen in its kanji form. This original meaning referred to a particular situation's development or unfolding.

In many cases this is after some state that has been continuing for a long time, or has been compounding further and further until (A). Like many other sentence altering adverbs, いよいよ will appear at the beginning of a phrase. It is also considered quite casual when compared to other grammar points like ついに. As いよいよ highlights something that is compounding, it can also frequently be translated as 'more and more'. The difference between the nuance of いよいよ being 'finally' or 'more and more' will usually be clear due to the statement following it being either conclusive (finally), or inconclusive (more and more)."

The polite negative (past) form requires use of the う - Verb , ある . This is not a unique rule for the negative past, but actually the correct way that all く-form conjugations of い-Adjectives should be constructed. However, in modern Japanese, it is not considered necessary. Instead, the semi-polite form is often used. The semi-polite form is constructed by using なかった , and then simply adding です ."

In English, うちに can simply be translated as 'while', or 'during'. うちに may be paired with the dictionary or ている form of verbs, the plain form of い-Adjectives , nouns followed by の, or な-Adjectives that are followed by な. Unlike 間 に , うちに expresses something that can happen/exist anywhere 'within' the span of (A), and is therefore non-specific as to where (B) is located. Fun Fact The kanji 裡 refers literally to the inner walls/lining of something, and anything that is enclosed within that space.

In the case of negation, the additional component will be ない (casual), or ません (polite). As can be seen here, the kana change differs depending on whether ない or ません is being used. If ない will be used, the last kana will always change from the kana ending with a う sound, to the kana ending with an あ sound within the same row. If ません will be used, the change will be from the う sound kana to the い sound kana. The only exception to this rule are verbs that end in the kana う. Instead of changing to あ (the あ sound kana in the same row), う will become わ, when used with ない . While the common translation of ない and ません is simply 'not', they actually have several possible nuances. These nuances are 'don't' (usually not), 'won't' (intentionally not), or 'can't' (unintentionally not). Both ない and ません are auxiliary verbs (ません is a conjugation of ます), meaning that they have their own set of conjugation rules. Caution The ない attached to make the negative form of adjectives is a different word, and therefore follows different conjugation rules. The ない attached to adjectives is an い-Adjective itself, and not an auxiliary verb ."

In most cases, 恐 らく is simply used as a formal way to say 'probably', or 'perhaps', and is usually partnered with other structures of conjecture such as だろう, かもしれない, etc. As 恐 らく behaves adverbially, it will most often appear at the beginning of sentences before a statement of conjecture is made. Although 恐 らく can, and often does, carry the meaning of 'I fear that (A)', it isn't necessarily always used in relation to negative things. In the case of this particular grammar pattern, the main nuance that 'I fear that (A)' conveys is modesty on behalf of the speaker in that they fear their assumption may be right, given the available information. Fun-fact Yodan, or 四段活用 verbs are a type of classical-Japanese verb that have primarily been replaced by godan (う-Verbs) in modern day Japanese."

Despite commonly being thought of as one word, it is actually the combination of か (the sentence-ending particle) and い, another sentence-ending particle that is primarily used by men (in a similar way to ね and よ ). かい will usually be used directly after the word or phrase that it is highlighting. In the case of verbs and い-Adjectives , の may be inserted before かい . For な-Adjectives and nouns, なの may be inserted directly before it. However, の (or なの ) are frequently omitted, due to how casual かい is. When it is not omitted, の (or なの ) may be shortened to ん (or なん）. This is in the same way that の and なの would behave in the のです and なのです grammar structures. Although there are some exceptions, かい will almost always be used to ask simple yes/no questions. Caution Because かい is very casual, and quite direct, it often sounds like an accusation. Due to this, care should be taken with your tone of voice, so as not to be taken the wrong way. Fun Fact Outside of かい , the sentence ending particle い is not commonly used in modern Japanese, and therefore will only appear in a few very specific structures (like だい). Despite being similar to ね , い is considered to be fairly ぞんざい 'rough', and should only be used with people that you are very familiar with, and never to someone above you."

This usually takes the form of something like a side job or a hobby. Caution Unlike ながら, かたわら does not necessarily indicate two actions that are happening at the exact same time, just actions that are happening independently of each other with one being the focus, and the other happening to a lesser extent within the same subject's life, day to day activities, etc."

In most cases, this translates as '(A), then again (B)', 'just when I thought (A), (B)', or 'no sooner than (A), (B)'. Literally, the meaning is close to 'before (A) could even be confirmed as having happened, (B)'. かと 思 うと and かと 思 ったら will regularly appear after verbs in either their dictionary or past-tense forms. Alternatively, this structure may also be seen following nouns, especially when the meaning is focused on the speaker's feelings about (A). Either なの (or の when used with verbs) may appear between the target phrase and かと 思 ったら when the (B) phrase includes the speaker's feelings. Caution - Occasionally, か may be omitted from this phrase, leaving only と 思 うと and と 思 ったら . Although the meaning is exactly the same, omission of the か will make the expression sound softer."

This structure will be seen connected to the ます-stem of verbs, or after nouns followed by に. Both the kanji and non-kanji forms may be used. It is quite common to see 兼 ねない come after conditional phrases that include と, ば, たら, でも, and similar structures. This indicates that 'if (A) were to happen, (B) may also occur'. Caution While this grammar structure is most often used to highlight negative outcomes, it may also be used to indicate or desire or wish sarcastically. Fun-fact As 兼 ねる means 'to spread across', in the negative, this expression can be thought of as similar to 'to not be a stretch' in English. It just indicates the action of (A) would not be a stretch of the ability or capacity of whoever or whatever is being discussed."

To use かもしれない , attach it to the end of any verb, noun, な-Adjective or い-Adjective , in their non-polite (keigo) forms. As the う-Verb 知 る is part of this construction, it may also be altered to its polite- potential form, creating かもしれません . Due to かもしれない being such a common grammar pattern in daily speech for expressing uncertainty about various things, several colloquial forms also exist. These are かも , かもしらん , and かもしれん . かも is by far the most common of these colloquial forms, with かもしらん potentially sounding a little bit rough/boyish."

It is usually translated as 'or', or 'either (A) or (B)'. Originally, this structure was a contraction of the conjunctive stem of い-Adjectives, く, and the imperative form of the う-Verb ある 'to be', あれ. い-Adjectives do not have their own imperative form , so くあれ and then the abbreviation かれ evolved to fill this role. As it is imperative, the literal meaning is simply 'be it (A) or (B)', and is a declaration. かれ～かれ will attach to the stem of 2 adjectives that are antonyms, before going on to explain how the result remains the same regardless. かれ～かれ is used with a very limited set of adjectives, so it is best not to use it with words that you have not come across previously. Caution In the case of 良 い 'good' and 悪 い 'bad', 悪 い will be read as 悪 しかれ, which comes from the archaic 悪 し 'bad'. This is considered as set phrase in modern Japanese."

(said with a rising tone). This nuance of か can be used after the dictionary form of almost any word in Japanese. However, using です or ます will change the nuance from 'presenting possibilities', to 'asking a formal question', so should be avoided."

This expression means 'to exist', or 'there is', and is used in relation to living/animate things. Because the things being described in these examples are considered to be alive (or operated by something that is alive), いる is the verb that will be used. ある is used for non-living things. The polite form of いる conjugates as います . Due to the る being removed, we can determine that いる is a る-Verb (Ichidan verb) . The kanji form of 居 る is quite common, and should be learned as early as possible to save any confusion while reading. There is no nuance difference between this expression being used with or without kanji, and is up to the preference of the writer. Caution The が in がいる is often omitted in casual speech, or writing that behaves like casual speech (manga, instant messaging, etc)."

Fun Fact がち as a grammar structure comes from the word 勝 ち, meaning 'a win'. 勝 ち in itself is used to express something that appears 'repeatedly', or 'again and again'. Due to this, がち may be thought of as similar to 'to win out' in English, meaning that 'although there are many possibilities, (A) winning out is the most likely'.

To use 見 られる , simply add it after the noun that you would like to show as being 'evident'. As られる is both the potential and passive form of 見 る, it may be interpreted either way.

This distinction is made depending on whether it is linked to another noun, or is independent. In the example with だ , 嫌 い is expressing that the thing is 'dislikable' (assertion). However, in the example with な , 嫌 い is expressing 'being disliked' as a quality of the noun it is attached to. In the same way that 好 き can often be partnered with 大 to mean 'love', 嫌 い can often be partnered with 大 to mean 'hate'. Caution Despite ending in い, 嫌 い is one of the few words that is actually a な-Adjective , and needs to be memorized."

Meaning that the (B) phrase is important, or needs to be considered. As can be seen from these examples, だ will be required when using this conjunction after a な-Adjective , or a noun. As a reminder, please see below for a list of the most casual form of 'but', to the most formal. Casual - けど - けども - けれど - けれども - が - Formal. Fun Fact Originally, けれども was thought to be a more feminine version of が . However, the modern けど is so common that it has lost all of the feminine nuance that came from けれども . Caution As with けど (and other forms of 'but' in Japanese), the phrase after けれども will often be omitted if it is obvious, or the speaker does not want to say it."

                        "content": "こそ is an adverbial particle in Japanese that primarily replaces either を or が. Its main role is to highlight the preceding noun (or noun phrase) as being the the most important piece of information in relation to the rest of the sentence. In English, this is an effect that is primarily achieved through things like bold text, underlining, or emphasizing a particular word in speech. If we were to make a direct comparison to an English statement, then things like 'precisely because it's (A)', or 'rather it is due to (A)', are quite similar to こそ 's function. こそ can be used directly after any noun that would usually take the を , or が particles, so long as that particular piece of information needs to be emphasized. Caution The reason that こそ is able to replace が, but not は, is due to the fact that が primarily highlights specific pieces of information, while は nominates general topics. This means that they have completely opposite functions. To make things easier, the three particles can be thought of in the following way: は- Weakly highlights specific information. が- Strongly highlights specific information. こそ - Very strongly highlights specific information. Fun Fact こそ is often used after names or pronouns, as a way to reply to thanks/apologies. In these situations, it expresses that the speaker feels equally (or more) obliged to say what was just said to them by someone else."

However, こと is only required when the (A) phrase needs nominalization (is not a noun to begin with). Due to this, ができる may be used by itself when following a noun, without changing the meaning. Fun Fact のが (or のは ) is also frequently used for nominalization, but this is rarely the case when a verb follows it. Some other expressions where のが may not be swapped for こと are as follows: ことがある - For (A) to exist. ことにする - To make something (A). ことになる - For (A) to come to be."

It will be translated as 'due to (A)', or 'because of (A)'. This is a fairly old-fashioned expression, and will almost exclusively be used in writing in modern Japanese. To use こととて , attach it to the end of a verb, or a noun followed by the case-marking particle の. こととて will primarily be used when asking for forgiveness for something. Due to this, when appearing after verbs, the verb will usually be in past tense, or have been negated with either ない or ぬ. This highlights something that was done and shouldn't have been, or wasn't done and should have been. In many cases, (A) will be something for which the negative result of (B) is obvious, or to be expected. Fun Fact とて is thought to either be a combination of the case-marking particle と and the conjunction particle て, or the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb たり, と, and the conjunction particle て. As the origin is unclear, it will be best to think of it as its own structure, that carries its own original meaning."

It is a combination of the nominalizing use of こと (for creating noun-phrases), and the ている-form of the う-Verb なる 'to become'. The primary difference between ことになる and ことになっている is that the latter focuses more on that something is 'expected to (A)', or 'scheduled to (A)'. In other words, it is 'becoming that (A)', but has not actually happened yet. This structure is often used after either the る or ない versions of verbs, in order to highlight the action which either is not not 'expected', or 'scheduled' to occur. Let's take a look at the 'scheduled to' meaning first. When indicating that something is 'expected to (A)', this is an example of ている's use for expressing habitual or ongoing actions/states that reoccur under some specific set conditions."

In these cases, (A) is a verb that will appear directly before こと. ことはない is often used to reassure someone that something will not come to pass. In this expression, the adverbial particle は is working to present (A) as the extent (a regular role of adverbial particles), while the 形容詞 ない negates that extent. This negation is up to interpretation, with the literal meaning simply being 'There is no (A)'. Caution This structure is very different to たことがない, which presents a single instance of something not having happened. As opposed to the case marking particle が, は presents the verb/verb-phrase as a topic itself in non-past form, highlighting its non-existence. Due to this, ことはない can imply that (A) is unthinkable, or even impossible."

These are as follows: 誘 い、 促 し - To invite, incite, or draw attention to something. 驚 き、 当惑 し - To express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment. 話 の 流 れ を 抑 える - To control or keep in check the flow of a conversation. In this lesson, we will be focusing on the first meaning (to invite or draw attention). In English, this is usually translated as 'there we go', 'ok then', or 'well you see'. さ (or sometimes さあ) will come at the beginning of a sentence, before the point that the speaker would like to highlight is explained. Caution This さ and the さ used for expressing confusion or bewilderment are often used interchangeably. When drawing attention, it comes across like 'well you see', but when expressing confusion, it is closer to 'well let me see'. The latter has a slight nuance of 'let me think about my answer first'."

A more literal translation which may carry the strength of this grammar pattern a bit better would be 'while however, (B)', or 'even while true, (B)'. Just like in English, the extension of the phrase in Japanese adds emphasis to the overall meaning. しかしながら will primarily appear at the beginning of a new sentence when referring back to something that has previously been stated, either by the speaker themselves or by another. As しかしながら is primarily used as an emphasized version of しかし, which itself is formal, しかしながら will primarily be seen in literature, or in formal spoken language."

However, this is considered very casual, or even a bit rough. Accordingly, it is best avoided in most conversations. Caution じゃない is used very frequently to ask questions. This is similar to じゃないか , a grammar point covered in another lesson. However, the nuance difference is that じゃない as a question is a little bit more blunt, like 'isn't it?' in English. On the other hand, じゃないか is more like 'don't you think?'. When じゃない is used as a question, it will usually be obvious, due to a rising tone."

Alternatively, ずっと can be used after から , to express that something has been continuing 'ever since' some specific event/point in time. Fun Fact ずっと literally means that something is 'unwavering', or 'unfaltering'. Due to this, the statement that ずっと is attached to will always be perceived as being 'far more (A)', or 'to the maximum amount possible for (A)', regardless of whether it is highlighting a noun, verb, or an adjective."

It has the equivalent role of ない, in expressing that something 'has not', or 'will not' happen. The case marking particle に is then combined with the adverbial particle は, and the negative-potential form of いる, いられない. ずにはいられない may be translated as 'cannot help doing (A)', or 'cannot resist doing (A)'. ずにはいられない will be attached to the indeterminate form of verbs. This is the same stem form as ない uses. Although ずにはいられない is often translated as 'cannot resist (A)', the literal meaning is simply 'cannot be without (A)'. Caution As the modern indeterminate form of する has several different forms, care will need to be taken when conjugating する verbs. While ない joins with し to create しない, ず will join with せ to create せず."

This role is negating the verb that it is attached to. ずに is simply the addition of the case marking particle に to ず. Together, they mean 'without doing', in a similar way to ないで. To use ずに, attach it to the indeterminate form of the verb that you wish to express as 'without doing (A)'. This is the same form used with ない. ずに is quite a bit more formal than ないで, but still frequently used in modern Japanese. Especially as part of set phrases, like ずにすむ (which we will learn about in another lesson). Caution When used with a する verb, する will become せずに, not しずに. Both せ and し are indeterminate forms of する . し, the more common form that is used in east Japan appears with ない."

When used at the beginning of a ない (or ません) containing phrase, 全然（ぜんぜん) has the meaning of 'completely not (A)', or 'not (A) at all'. In writing, it is equally as natural to use either 全然 as kanji, or hiragana only, so both forms may be used confidently. ぜんぜん is more flexible (and friendly sounding) in casual conversation than 全 く , a similar expression which has a formal (often negative) nuance. While both of these sentences have the meaning of 'not (A) at all', まったく could give the listener the impression that you are not pleased with the situation. This will depend quite a bit on tone of voice, though. Caution Despite originally being used only with negative expressions, it is becoming more and more common for ぜんぜん to appear with positive expressions as well. In these cases, it just has the meaning of 'totally (A)', or 'completely (A)'. Although this is technically not grammatically correct, it is becoming so frequently used that it is considered correct by most people (especially the younger generation)."

It can convey one of the following things: Hearsay: 伝聞 - Highlighting things that have been heard from other people. Appearance: 様態 - Highlighting the way that things 'appear', or 'seem'. The appearance nuance is covered in another lesson, so we will focus on hearsay in this grammar point. When used to repeat statements that have been heard from other people/sources, そうだ (or そう です ) will be paired with the plain form of a verb or い-Adjective , or a noun/ な-Adjective followed by だ . そうだ always implies that the speaker is not 100% certain about the validity of the information that they are conveying. Due to this, it does not sound as confident as other expressions, like ようだ . Caution In order to avoid confusion between the そうだ that is used for repeating information, and the そうだ that is used for making observations, the following differences will need to be memorized. Verbs - 降 るそうだ - Unaltered verb, そうだ that is repeating information. 降 りそうだ - Conjunctive form , そうだ that is used for making observations. い-Adjectives - 寒 いそうだ - Unaltered adjective, そうだ that is repeating information. 寒 そうだ - い removed, そうだ that is used for making observations. Nouns and な-Adjectives - 綺麗 だそうだ - だ  is used before そうだ. This is repeating information. 綺麗 そうだ - No だ between the な-Adjective and そうだ. This is making an observation."

In this lesson, we will focus on the form that is used with the conjunctive (stem) form of words. Please examine the structure guide to see these forms. Caution そう may also be used when attached to the い-Adjective , ない. In this case, there is a unique conjugation rule which we will need to be careful of. As always, い will be removed from ない before attaching そう . However, さ will be inserted between な, and そう . This creates the expression なさそう. Note that this addition of さ does not happen with verbs. This is due to the ない that is used with negative verbs being an auxiliary verb ,  and not an い-Adjective . With the auxiliary verb ない, simply remove the い, before adding そう directly to the stem. Caution This そう is utilized exclusively to make predictions/guesses about something based on visual information. It is relatively low confidence, so should not be used for things that are obvious. In these cases, みたい would be used instead."

It is often used for politely expressing one’s personal opinion in relation to something.

The difference in nuance is that something marked with が is considered to be wanted more. たい is conjugated in the same way as い-Adjectives , meaning that the negative , past , or past-negative forms may also be used. たい is only used for expressing things that 'you' want, or repeating information/asking questions about what other people want. It may not be used to make guesses about what other people 'may' want, unless asking them directly. Caution たい is not used to tell other people that you want them to do something. This is done with ～てほしい . Caution たい is not usually used when giving invitations (asking someone if they want to do something with you). In these cases ～ませんか is far more natural."

It is a combination of the neologism ただ ‘merely’, and the adverbial particle のみ ‘just’ or ‘only’. のみ itself has the same meanings and uses as both だけ and ばかり, but is slightly more formal. Frequently, (A) will be a verb that indicates movement, continuation, or hope. This highlights that one has already done everything that is possible, and all that is left to do is hope for a good result, or that one is already doing all that is necessary, and all that remains is to continue. When する-Verbs are used with this expression, occasionally it will be replaced by ある. This puts more focus on the existence of the action, rather than the action itself. The replacement of する with ある is primarily literary."

As with most other grammar patterns that ところ is seen with, the focus is on the situation of the verb occurring. ～たところで is often translated as 'even if (A), not (B)', or 'even if (A), it won't be (B)'. This 'even if' nuance is created by the fact that ～たところで sentences will never have something in the past tense in the second half of the sentence, despite using the past tense before ところ. This is similar to the English 'even if (A) were to happen, (B) would still not occur'. As can be seen by the examples above, ～たところで will convey things that are counter to what the speaker either wants to, or wishes would happen. Due to this, the (B) half of the sentence will almost always be something unfavorable. Fun Fact Due to ～たところで always marking some kind of negative result in (B), (A) will often be preceded by words such as 今 さら, いくら, or どんなに. These usually just emphasize the frustration that the speaker feels about the inevitable result."

However, when used with verbs in the past tense, ために more frequently highlights that something happened 'due to (A)', rather than 'for the sake of (A)'. Because of this, a more accurate description of ため in all situations is 'in light of (A)'. This expresses that (A) is the primary or major event/thing that resulted in (B). To use ために as 'in light of', 'as a result of', or 'because of', attach it to the end of verb in its past form, or a noun follow by の. It may also be used after い-Adjectives or な-Adjectives in their attributive form . This 'in light of (A)' nuance can be used in reference to things that have already happened (as above), or in reference to something that is considered as the purpose of an action (as in our other ために grammar point)."

To use this expression, convert the verb that you want to use into its たら form, and then add どう. Sometimes たら is used by itself, with a tone that implies that it is a question (or simply by adding a question mark in written language). This is an abbreviation of たらどう , and carries the same nuance. だ or か may be added to the end of たらどう , to emphasize the 'question' even further. However, they are not required.

However, instead of having the nuance of 'then', or 'and', it has the nuance of 'and things like'. Basically, it is used for listing sequences of events that do not happen in a specific order. The last たり in any sequence will almost always be followed by する (or した for past tense). From these examples we can see that たり will sometimes be said as だり . This happens with the same verbs that usually use だ for past tense (like 読 んだ), or で for the て form ( like 泳 いで). This will not change the meaning at all, and is only to help make the words easier to say. To summarize, the difference between て form, and たり is as follows. Events in order - I did (A) て , (B) て , (C) て , (D) た. Events in no specific order - I did (D) たり , (B) たり , (A) たり , (C) たり した . たり is frequently used when there is only one verb in the sentence. This just means that the speaker did 'things like (A)', without specifically listing anything else. Caution In cases where a する verb is the last verb in a particular sequence, たり will often be omitted."

In this way, だが is very similar to the expression 'that may be, but…' in English. だが may be used at the beginning of any phrase, or between sentences. Caution When using ですが , it will automatically mean that the rest of the sentence should also use polite speech . To make だが sound a little bit softer, sometimes ね is added. However, this is not so common in modern-day Japanese, and is more limited to the older generation. Fun Fact Due to だが and ですが using が (the formal equivalent of けど ), this phrase can sound quite stiff. Therefore, it is far more common to hear でも at the beginning of a sentence in casual speech."

In this particular structure, だけ pairs with は, and presents a specific verb as the topic to indicate that it is being done 'as much as one can'. The same verb will be repeated both before and after だけは , with the one coming second usually appearing in its past-tense or ている form. Imagining that the target verb was 食 べる 'to eat', the literal translation of something like 食 べる だけは 食 べた would be 'I ate just what I could eat'. Because this pattern frequently discusses possibilities, it is also very common for the first verb to be in the potential れる or られる form. Caution It is also relatively common to see する omitted following the first verb, and only being used after だけは . In this kind of pattern, the target verb itself will not usually be repeated after だけは ."

Caution In situations where the words that だの is attached to are opposites, it will be exhibiting a large range to which the same rule applies. However when the words are similar, it is usually expressing things within that specific category as being undesirable. Because of this, regardless of what the words are, the overall statement itself aims to emphasize the speaker's feelings of frustration or boredom in relation to things that fall under that category, or that scope."

Originally, it comes from the kanji construction 段々 , which can be thought of as meaning 'step by step', 'stepwise', or even 'steadily'. だんだん is similar to ほとんど , in that it can modify the meaning of entire phrases, rather than just single words. To use だんだん , simply put it before the phrase that you want to express as '(A) that is increasing steadily'. While だんだん can take the particle と , it is not required. In fact, と is very often omitted from adverbs/onomatopoeic words (words that represent a sound or motion) in Japanese. Caution Initially, it can be easy to mix-up だんだん , with どんどん . どんどん is an onomatopoeic word that represents loud banging (like on a drum), so is used to express fast changes/progression. This is unlike だんだん , which expresses slower changes/progression."

Due to this, the literal meaning of 序 に may be thought of as 'with (A) as the precedence, (B)'. 序 に is commonly used with verbs, or nouns. In the case of nouns, it will need to be preceded by the case marking particle の. Fun Fact Just like 'precedence' in English, 序 に implies that (A) is the instigator for (B). Because of this, 序 に is a good way to convey that something is not urgent, but, if (A) is happening, it is the perfect chance to do (B) as well. Caution 序 に is more formal than 間 に or 時 に, so has more of a tendency to be used for 'one-off' things, rather than regular occurrences. Despite this, it still may be used to describe regular occurrences at times, especially when speaking formally or politely, such as to a senpai."

To use this grammar point, you will need to attach て to any verb, and then follow it with いく. This nuance is usually that '(A) happened and then went', or 'will happen, and then go'. In other words, it will depend on whether いく is in present, or past tense. ていく can be used when representing time, or when representing a physical place. When representing a physical place, it is more likely that the kanji structure, 行 く will be used. However, this is not a set rule, and depends on the writer. When used in relation to time, the nuance is usually that something has already started/is about to start, and then will continue to progress in the same way. This is the opposite of てくる , which indicates that something has finally reached a certain state, after progressing in that way for some time. Fun Fact When compared to English, ていく is very similar to the phrase 'to go on to (A)', in relation to time. It focuses on the fact that the speaker is required to make some type of journey to arrive at a specific point. For example, 'She went on to become a doctor after university'."

This is for things that are not 'continuing', but happen so often that they are considered to be continuous (like going to work, having a hobby, and similar things). Due to いる being one of the verbs for 'existing' in Japanese, the ている form is closer to 'continuing to exist in a specific state', rather than (A)~ing in English. In this construction, it can be thought of as 'to be existing in the state of performing a regular activity'. Caution With this meaning of ている , to make it easier to understand, expressions of time are often used. This can be things like 毎日 , 毎晩 , 毎週 , and similar phrases. Fun Fact Regularly in novels, manga, and specifically some parts of Japan, とる may be used instead of ている with the same meaning."

The primary difference is that 呉 れる (primarily written in hiragana) means to 'bestow to the speaker' (or someone in the speakers inner circle). In this way, てくれる is the opposite of てあげる , which conveys that someone (usually the speaker) gives (an action) to another person that is outside of their inner circle. てくれる is commonly translated as 'would you do (A) for me', as a question, or 'someone did (A) for me', as a statement. When asking for a favor, てくれる can be shortened to てくれ . However, this is very casual, and should not be used with strangers (or anyone that you do not know well). As an English equivalent, てくれ sounds similar to phrases like 'would ya do (A)', or 'could ya do (A)?' Fun Fact てくれる is one of the most casual ways to ask for a favor, with てもらう being slightly more polite. ていただく (the humble speech variation of てくれる ) is even more polite than either of these!"

As discussed in one of our previous lessons on て , we examined the 'since', or 'due to' meaning that it can have. Let's look at a few examples. Phrases that use this particular (A) て (B) nuance of the て-form primarily express something that is beyond the control of the speaker in the (B) statement. Coming from the verb 済 む (to finish), すみません (the negated form) means 'to be unfinished'. In this way, てすみません literally means that the speaker feels that something is 'unfinished due to (A)'. This is very similar to phrases like 'having unfinished business' in English. Although the translation is 'I'm sorry', perhaps it would be easier to remember this grammar structure as highlighting someone's regret/unfinished feelings about (A), and simply showing that to the person that is being apologized to."

Although は can be dropped from many phrases and expressions, the は in this particular grammar point is usually not. This is because いけない would then become the second action in a sequence of events (the usual function of て form). However, to make this more casual, て は is often changed to ちゃ (ては becomes ちゃ), or じゃ (では becomes じゃ), as this is easier to say. Caution Apart from いけない ; ならない and だめ are also frequently used to get across the same meaning. However, they are used in different situations. いけない - Fairly neutral. Used in both spoken and written language. ならない - Fairly formal. Used mostly in written language. だめ - Very casual. Used almost exclusively in spoken language."

The abbreviated versions of ちゃ and じゃ may also be seen with the grammar point, but it may be considered unnatural if the same abbreviation is not used both times. This is mainly due to the level of formality being required to stay the same within sentences. Caution ては may sometimes appear only once, without any change to the meaning of repetition.

This is created by removing the い and then replacing it with く. This phrase is also regularly used without the も , but is considered a bit more direct/casual in those cases. It is best to remove the も only when talking to people that you know well. てもいい is an expression that literally means て (noun, etc) も (also) いい (is good). Similarly to the てもいい grammar point that is used with verbs, this variant may also be used as a question. To do this, you simply need to follow てもいい with です か , or the more casual の ."

This will be translated as ‘to do for’. In other cases, やる acts more like 見 せる ‘to show’, and indicates the speaker’s strong will to perform an action. In these cases, it will be translated as ‘I will do (A), just wait and see’, or ‘I’ll definitely do (A)’. However, in either the place of あげる or みせる, the underlying meaning is just ‘to do’, with emphasis on the doer being the person that is in power over the result of the action due to their superiority."

Fun Fact Because the な that is used with な-Adjectives is simply the attributive form of だ , である may replace な or の when connecting one noun to another. The attributive form just means the form of a word that can be directly linked to a noun. As ある's attributive form is just ある, it does not need to be modifed at all. However, although this is grammatically correct, it would sound quite stiff in many circumstances, and should be avoided in standard speech. Caution であります (as opposed to である ) is very formal, and will almost exclusively be used by people within jobs that absolutely require this level of formality (politics, police force, military, etc). Due to this, its use within regular conversation will sound stiff, or perhaps even like the speaker is jokingly being over polite."

Let's take a look at a few examples. でござる may also be seen, as it is the base form of で + ございます a (special-class) verb. However, in modern Japanese, this is primarily restricted to historical dramas, or characters that have a somewhat 'quirky' personality. Fun Fact Using でございます to introduce yourself is considered quite polite, however, when referring to other people, いらっしゃる 'to be' is preferred, as honorific language is more respectful than polite speech ."

These constructions highlight the 'ingredients', or 'materials' that something is/was made out of. Let's look at some examples. から and で are both case marking particles in this grammar point, and while they express much the same thing when translated into English, there is a slight nuance difference. These differences are as follows: から - Literally 'prepared from'. Tends to be used more frequently when the material is not obvious at first glance. May also put focus on the ingredients/materials before there was any alteration. で - Literally 'prepared with'. Tends to be used more frequently when the materials are more obvious. Despite this, recent generations use で in most situations, regardless of if the material is visible at first glance or not. As a result, でできる and からできる are almost indistinguishable in modern Japanese. Caution There is also a small nuance difference between できる , and できている , when used as part of this construction. できる is usually used when talking about something broadly 'everything in category (B) is made from (A)', while できている is used more frequently when examining a specific item 'this particular (B) is made from (A)'. Like the difference between で and から though, they are largely interchangeable."

This can be translated as 'that means', or 'that is to say'. ということは based sentences will often finish with ということだ , although it is not limited to appearing this way. The more literal translation is something similar 'that which is said to be (A), (B)'. In this way, it simply presents (A) as a thing that requires further explaining. Additionally, ということは will appear at the beginning of sentences, when the speaker is confirming their understanding about something that has just been said. Often in the form of a question. In these cases, the translation is similar 'so you mean to say that (A)?'. As can be seen from the breakdown of という, こと, and は, this statement just expresses that the 'thing' which is 'classified as' (A) is 'in general' understood to be (B)."

Together, they are usually translated as 'the ~ known as ~ is ~', or 'the ~ called ~ is ~'. Sometimes, it can even simply be '~ means ~'. In essence, というのは is just a way to turn an entire phrase into a noun, before explaining that noun further. This explanation of (A) will either be to give a definition of it, or to give a reason for it. To use というのは , attach it to the end of a phrase that you would like to indicate as being something that will be explained further '(A)', and then follow it with your definition/reason, '(B)'. Caution Unlike というのは, which is mainly used to strongly present facts, or highlight points of discussion, replacement of は with the adverbial particle も can be used either as a rebuttal or as an extension of the original statement. This is when someone wants to show that (B) has equal weight when compared to (A). It may also be used to give the reason or cause for (A). Caution というのは is sometimes used at the beginning of a new sentence, when the speaker wants to add extra information about what has already been said. In these situations, the translation is similar to 'what I mean to say is ~', or 'because of that, ~'. Caution というのは is regularly abbreviated as とは, or って. This can be a little bit hard to identify in casual speech, but the '(B) explains (A)' concept will still almost always apply, so should be identified that way."

Fun Fact という (and the verb 言 う itself) is often quite misunderstood, as the closest translation in English is 'to say'. In Japanese, 言 う actually refers to the information about something that cannot be discovered by simply 'looking at' it. For example, if you look at a man, you cannot know that his name is Bob, or that he works in an office, but you can know whether he is 'short', 'tall', etc. Due to this, という should only be used to express information that requires intimate knowledge, and not simple observations. It is possible to see (A) という (B) in sentences where (A) is describing something that seems 'obvious'. However, in these cases, the speaker is usually implying that something about (A) is not exactly as it seems, or that their opinion/knowledge differs. This particular nuance is not limited to nouns, and may be seen with almost any word type."

This expression will be used twice, where both the (A) and the (B) phrase are being questioned by the speaker. As with many other uses of と of a quotation , the preceding word may be almost anything. と 言 おうか is interchangeable with the more common と 言 うか, but it is advisable to only use it when specific emphasis needs to be made, or for some type of dramatic effect. In many cases, it will sound unnatural in daily speech. と 言 おうか will frequently be used with fairly vague or imprecise descriptions, in order to avoid but hint at what the speaker actually wants to say. Often, this will be something negative, and will therefore be omitted."

This structure is a combination of the case-marking particle と, and 来 る combined with the conjunction particle たら 'if', 来 たら. It will often simply be translated as 'that blasted (A)', or 'that damn (A)'. Despite this, the literal meaning is just 'when it comes to (A)'. ときたら will directly follow nouns. This grammar pattern will almost exclusively appear in kana, so memorizing the stem verb it comes from will help to remember the meaning. Fun Fact In line with the literal meaning of 'when it comes to (A)', ときたら may also be used when the speaker wants to highlight something about (A) that is 'to be expected', or 'only natural'. Determining whether ときたら is being used in this way, or to express frustration, is usually quite clear in the second half of the statement. Despite having two almost opposite nuances, it may help to think of ときたら as just 'when it comes to (A)' in all situations, with the (B) part of the phrase indicating whether it is positive or negative."

The first is 'in spite of (A)', or 'regardless of (A)'. This nuance of ところ will be that the speaker is politely acknowledging the situation that someone else is in, and apologizing for interrupting them in that moment. ところを may come after any structure that could pair with a noun. This means verbs in their standard forms , い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives followed by な, or nouns followed by の. The second meaning that ところを is often used for will simply be 'when (A)', or 'at the time of (A)', with a focus on being a situation in which the action of (A) is interrupted by (B). This may have either a positive or negative nuance. This use of ところを will appear exclusively after verbs in any of their standard forms . The を itself may be omitted when used to express either of these meanings. Fun Fact ところを is occasionally split into two different grammar points depending on the source. However, it is important to remember that the underlying meaning of both of these is the same. ところ marks the place or situation, while を marks how that situation is being utilized either positively or negatively. When it comes to apologizing, the speaker themselves is the one 'using' that moment with を, and is therefore acknowledging that."

This may be translated as 'even if we assume that it's (A)', or 'assuming that (A)'.

In some cases, としても just functions as an extension of として 'as', and can be interpreted as 'even as (A)'. This nuance primarily highlights people or organizations in the position of (A), and states that 'even for (A), it will still be (B)'. Unlike the previous nuance, this としても will only be used with nouns."

It will be interpreted as ‘(A) of all people’, or ‘such as (A)’. Often, ともあろう will be followed by the speaker's opinion about how (A) is being ignorant of what is expected of them. This construction is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the adverbial particle も, and the volitional form of the う-Verb ある, あろう ‘to be’. The literal meaning is ‘even a (B) such as (A), (C)’, with (C) being something unexpected or unwanted. ともあろう will be seen after nouns, and may be followed by the conjunction particle が ‘but’, or a combination of the noun もの and が for further emphasis. もの is primarily used for emphasis, and other words such as 方 ‘individual’, or 人 ‘person’ may also be used. Caution Occasionally, this grammar pattern may be used sarcastically towards someone of the same position or lower. The context of the sentence is the only thing  that would clarify whether it is criticism or sarcasm."

Both と 同 じで and と 違 って will be preceded by a noun or noun phrase, before the (B) part of the sentence will describe the similarity/dissimilarity.

As the case marking particle と is being used in its 引用 (citation) use, と 言 える may follow any direct phrase/statement. と 言 える is regularly seen paired with grammar patterns like だろう , or でしょう . This makes the overall statement more friendly, by considering the listener's thoughts about the issue being presented. と 言 えるだろう can simply be translated as 'can we not say (A)?', or '(A) can be said, right?'. Caution When the potential form of 言 う is linked with the auxiliary verb よう, it creates a much stronger phrase that is similar to 'let it be said that (A)'. Fun Fact The speaker is usually relatively confident about their statement when using と 言 える, but the usage of a form that expresses conjecture shows that they are open to the possibility of being wrong, thus softening the tone."

In these cases, と is actually a conjunction particle , and shows one of three things. 仮定 の 順接 - A result that is assumed to be true, and obvious. 確定 の 順接 - A result that is known to be true. 仮定 の 逆接 - The opposite of a result that is assumed to be true. Due to this, the (B) part of a phrase using と as 'if', will always occur when (A) happens, as it is considered to be the result of (A). と may not be used in situations where the (B) result 'might' happen. It must be definite (or close to definite). In this particular nuance of と , despite being translated as 'if', the actual meaning is much closer to 'and', as と is expressing that (A) and (B) will always go together."

Usually, there is no way to stop (B) from happening, and it is considered a natural consequence of (A). In English, this translates closely with phrases like 'at any rate', or 'in any case'. Being an adverb, どうせ most often appears at the beginning of sentences, before going on to describe the inevitable situation. どうせ often carries the nuance of frustration or resignation that (A) cannot be changed. In these cases, it is often paired with other grammar structures such as なら or だから. This shows that if (A) cannot be changed, then (B) is a good idea. This usage translates similarly to 'if (A), you might as well (B)'. Fun-fact This grammar structure comes from a combination of どう 'how', and the imperative form of する, せよ. In this way, it is just emphasizing that no matter 'how (A) is done', the result cannot be changed."

These translations appear when the actual situation is considered to be even more remarkable than the phrase that どころではない is attached to. This grammar pattern will be seen at the end of phrases indicating some situation which is not ideal. Additionally, ではない may be replaced with じゃない in more casual settings. どころではない may also sometimes be translated as 'it is not the time for (A)'. In sentences that use this interpretation, (A) is considered to be something that there is no allowance for due to there being far more important matters. This use will reflect the personal opinion of the speaker."

These words are known as onomatopoeia (オノマトペ in Japanese). どんどん represents the sound of banging (like on a drum), or the pounding of feet. In this way, it is regularly translated as 'rapidly', or 'quickly'. Like だんだん , どんどん may be used before almost any phrase. While どんどん can take the particle と , it is not required. In fact, と is very often omitted from adverbs/onomatopoeic words in Japanese. Caution Initially, it can be easy to mix-up どんどん , with だんだん . だんだん is used to express slower changes, and may be thought of as similar to 'steadily', or 'step by step' in English. Fun Fact When the と particle is used with onomatopoeic words, it is very similar to one of と 's main usages as a quotation marker in Japanese. This means that と has a similar role to words like 'went', or 'goes' in English. For example, In English, we would say: The door 'goes' BANG with the wind. However, the door doesn't actually 'go' anywhere. This is similar to what と is doing here."

This structure may literally be translated as something similar to 'not (A) is not all there is'. However, the common translations are '(A) is not impossible', or 'it doesn't mean that it isn't (A)'. This expression may be used with the ない form of any verb, い-Adjective , or な-Adjective . Let's have a look at a few examples before exploring the meaning further. By itself, ことはない highlights something that is unneeded, or never happens. This is partly due to the adverbial particle は expressing something as being 'complete'. In this way, 'there is no situation in which (A)', is quite an accurate translation of ことはない. By adding ない to the (A) verb, all ないことはない is doing is simply changing this nuance to 'there is -not- no situation in which (A)', a double negative expressing that (A) is actually possible. Fun Fact ないことはない often appears with verbs in the potential form. This usually implies a lack of effort, or feelings of half heartedness toward the completion of (A). It is similar to 'it's not like I can't (A)' in English."

The second is to request that someone 'not do (A)'. We will examine the first in this write-up. ないで is a combination of the auxiliary verb ない, and the particle で . Due to this, で keeps its standard meaning of 'with/by', in relation to 'not' doing something. When ないで is used to express that '(A) has not been done before doing (B)', this is usually contrary to some kind of expectation. Because of this, ないで is often used to express something that may be surprising to the listener. Caution Be careful of the following two structures: (A) ないで (B) - Without doing (A), (B). (A) なくて (B) - Without doing (A), (B). Technically, these two constructions share a similar meaning. However, in modern Japanese ないで is used more frequently when the (B) action is being highlighted as being done without (A). On the other hand, なくて is used when (A) is being given as a reason for why something else was/wasn't done."

As this is a combination of the negated form of a verb, 訳 'reason', or 'logic', に, は, and the negated form of 行 く, the literal meaning is just 'there's no reason that (A) can't be done', or 'it cannot be so that (A) won't be done'. Compared to other similar structures like なければならない, ないといけない, and various others, ない 訳 にはいかない implies that there are some circumstances as to why (A) cannot be avoided, so will often be used when giving an excuse or reasoning as to why one must do (A)."

Like てはいけない (must not), なくてはいけない (must), and なくてはならない (must), these abbreviation forms can be followed by いけない , ならない , or だめ. However, they are usually omitted, without changing the meaning. Structures like this are referred to as spoken/colloquial language . These casual variations can come across in a very similar way to words like 'gotta' in English. In these examples, a variety of forms have been used naturally. There is no 'most natural' form, and it will often depend on the speaker as to which they choose. As with almost all grammatical structures, the shortest variations (not including いけない , etc.) are the most casual/used the most often. There are several other ways that these common abbreviations can appear based on region, or even an individual speaker's preference. An example of this is なけりゃ, which is a (very) casual form of なければ . In this example, we can see that some of these less common variations are used specifically by certain genders (in general). なけりゃ itself tends to be used by male speakers, and may be considered a bit rougher than なきゃ , or なくちゃ , which can be used by anybody."

This results in the same 'and' meaning as the standard て form, but with the negative meaning of ない. なくて can be translated as 'to not (A), and…', or 'not (A), and…', depending on what type of word it is used with. As discussed in our initial lesson about ない, there are two forms of this particular word. One form is an auxiliary verb, and is used with verbs. The other form of ない is an い-Adjective ( 形容詞 ), and is used with nouns, な-Adjectives , and い-Adjectives . The difference between these two, is that the い-Adjective form may have は in between it and the word it is connected to ( では in the case of nouns and な-Adjectives ). With verbs, due to ない being an auxiliary verb , this is not possible. Caution なくて is very similar to ないで , another structure that is regularly used with verbs (but may not be used with nouns or adjectives). ないで is far more common when expressing 'not doing' something, while なくて tends to be used almost exclusively for expressing reasons/causes."

However, it is important to remember that this is actually a double negative, and therefore means 'If (A) is not done, it cannot become', or more simply '(A) cannot not be done'. To make this construction, the auxiliary verb ない will need to be conjugated with ば , creating なければ (if not). After this, ならない (to not become) will be added to the end. As we learned in the なきゃ lesson, なければ may be shortened to なきゃ . This structure is frequently used, either with or without the added ならない . Caution While いけない (to not be able to go) and ならない (to not become) are quite similar, ならない will rarely be used outside of formal situations, or in writing. Due to this, いけない will be heard much more frequently in speech (when it is not omitted)."

This is considered to be an abbreviation of ならば , the hypothetical form of なり, a classical auxiliary verb that is not used much in modern Japanese. Because なり originally meant 'to be', it functions in a similar way to the auxiliary verb だ . This means that it regularly pairs with nouns, or phrases that have been nominalized (become noun-like), through the use of の . However, unlike だ (or です ), なら is also regularly used without the extra help of の for nominalization, and can be attached directly to verbs or い-Adjectives . Caution Because なら is an abbreviation of ならば , it is strictly used when making guesses about what 'may', or what 'could' happen in certain situations. This means that it will not be used as 'if' in statements about results that are produced through some sort of effort/training. Fun Fact Although なら comes from the classical auxiliary verb なり, it should not be confused with the particle なり, which often has the meaning of 'as soon as', or 'just after'. Thankfully, the particle なり is also quite uncommon in modern Japanese."

They are thought to have overlapping meanings in many circumstances, and なんか itself may be considered an adverbial particle . なんて is an extension of this, and may be considered an abbreviation of などという 'to say something like'. Both なんか and なんて are used in the same way as など , having translations like 'such as', and 'things like' in English. The primary difference between なんか and なんて is that なんて is far more common after 用言 (conjugatable words). This includes verbs, い-Adjectives , and な-Adjectives . On the other hand, なんか is almost exclusively used after 体言 (unconjugatable words). In other words, nouns. Despite the 体言 and 用言 tendency, most native speakers will not consider it incorrect to use either なんか or なんて with any type of word. Fun Fact Both なんか and なんて are often used to show a low evaluation of the word that they follow. This can come across as humility when used in relation to oneself, or as an insult when used in relation to others. Don't let this point stop you from using なんか or なんて though, as many native speakers use it simply to fill the silence in modern Japanese."

                        "content": "In Japanese, the vast majority of な-Adjectives are originally nouns, and differ from nouns only in that they have their own set of conjugation rules. The dictionary form of a な-Adjective will always be followed by だ . な is only attached when describing another noun. As we can see from these examples, だ or です is required at the end of a sentence, but な will be required when using a な-Adjective to describe a noun. な-Adjectives are mostly words of foreign (Chinese/English) origin. This is why they have evolved to require unique conjugation rules. Fun Fact As a learner, it can be very difficult to identify what a な-Adjective is, compared to a regular noun. Nouns conjugate with の , while な-Adjectives conjugate with な. A very simple trick that Japanese children learn is using the adverb とても 'very'. If とても sounds natural with a word, then it is probably a な-Adjective , if it sounds unnatural, then the word is likely to be a regular noun. From this example, we can see that とても can be used to help identify な-Adjectives . Basically, this is due to adjectives being measurable 'very big', 'very small', while nouns are not measurable 'very dog', 'very boat'."

This is different from づらい, which focuses more on a task that is difficult due to being unbearable/hard to endure for some reason.

Just like the にする grammar point that is used for highlighting decisions, this にする construction implies that the speaker has a high level of control over the action. Basically, this changes the adjective into an adverb, and then uses する to show that the adjective itself is the thing that is being done. Fun Fact にする is one of four regularly repeating grammar patterns in Japanese that highlight the level of control that the speaker has over the action/result of an action. From highest to lowest level of control, these are as follows: にする - High level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action themselves. になる - High level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action themselves, but there is no external target. とする - Medium level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action, but some outside factors may need to be considered (difficulty, other people, time, etc.). となる - Low level of control, the speaker/subject has almost no control over these actions, and something that came about purely due to external factors is being discussed."

This ‘switching away from’ portion may be used as a reminder of the large size of the difference that this grammar pattern usually indicates. に 引 き 換 え is a combination of the case-marking particle に, the conjunctive form of the う-Verb 引 く ‘to pull’, 引 き, and the conjunctive form of the る-Verb 換 える ‘to switch between’, or ‘to interchange’, 換 え. に 引 き 換 え may follow almost any type of word, but will require a の to precede it before い-Adjectives or verbs, and なの to precede it before な-Adjectives. (A) and (B) will always be two opposite ends of some kind of spectrum, where one is considered to be good, while the other is regarded as bad based on the subjective opinion of the speaker. Additionally, それにひきかえ may be used to begin sentences where the comparison is being made to a previous statement. Caution Both (A) and (B) will be facts that are plainly observable or measurable.

This pattern is a combination of に, も, the う-Verb 拘 わる 'to fixate on', or 'to stick to', and the literary auxiliary verb ず, which connects with verbs in the same way, and carries the same meaning as ない. This structure is most frequently seen connected to verbs, い-Adjectives and nouns in their standard forms. In most cases, this pattern will appear without kanji. Literally, this phrase can be thought of as expressing 'without being affected by (A), (B)', or 'without fixating on (A), (B)'. However, it is almost always used in exactly the same way as のに 'despite'. Caution It is important not to get にも 拘 わらず mixed up with に 関 わらず. The former expresses 'despite', while the latter tends to be used more often for 'no matter if'."

Alternatively, に 反 する may be used when directly modifying the following noun. Unlike に 対 して , に 反 して will often be used when a prediction does not match the actual reality of a situation. に 反 して is a fairly formal grammar pattern, so will be found mostly in literature, official documents, or speeches."

It is a mix of the case-marking particle に, and the negatived form of the る-Verb 堪 える ‘to tolerate’, 堪 えない. In this meaning, に 堪 えない will be used following verbs. This is in contrast to the に 堪 えない grammar point that follows nouns, and means ‘to be very (A)’, but is more literally ‘to be so (A) I can’t stand it’. Although 堪 える will be used more often than other kanji that have the same reading and similar meanings, this is not always the case. Occasionally 耐 える ‘to withstand’ will be used when the emphasis is on the ability to endure (A), while 絶 える ‘to discontinue’, or ‘to peter out’ will be used when the emphasis is on not being able to suppress (A). For 絶 える, this is especially used in the case of strong feelings. Caution The affirmative form of に 堪 える may also be used to express that something is ‘worth doing’. A closer interpretation of this would be similar to an English phrase like ‘to be passable for (A)’. Rather than meaning that something is particularly suitable, it just highlights that it also acceptably falls in the category of (A), despite not being intended for it, or perhaps not expected."

In this way, the literal meaning of 'culminating within (A) is (B)' is quite close to the nuance of the English translations. に 至 っては will appear following nouns, or nominalized phrases. Caution As the verb 至 る itself is used to present extreme examples or locations that are considered to be right 'on the precipice' of something, に 至 っては will primarily present things that are surprising or astonishing in some way. This is primarily only used when the example itself is quite negative or unfavorable."

It is usually translated as 'if you ask (A), (B)', or 'according to (A), (B)'.

To use this structure, simply attach it to the end of a noun marking the person or group whose opinion is being given. Other hypothetical structures such as と and たら may also be used, but ば is the most common. Additionally, this pattern may sound self-important, so is best used sparingly, especially when giving your own opinions. Occasionally, から will be used instead of に. Caution With the auxiliary verbs せる and させる, it will be important to remember that に tends to be mark the doer when they are being allowed to do something, as in this case, while を will be used more frequently when the doer is being made to do something."

In this way, に keeps its regular nuance of being a 'goal', or 'destination', within which something else takes place. Caution This use of に should not be confused with で in relation to time. When で is used for 'time', it is expressing the amount of time that is required to do something, or how much time something is expected to take. It is not used for frequency. Due to this, you can think of に as marking a portion (or portions) of time inside of a larger space of time, within which something happens.

It may also be pronounced as ねえ . ね is used when the speaker is looking for agreement from someone, or wants confirmation about something. Due to this, it is often translated as 'right?', or 'isn't it?'. To use ね , simply add it to the end of almost any sentence. As we will cover in our lesson about the sentence ending particle な , ね can almost be thought of as the opposite. ね is used when expressing a shared opinion, a shared thought, or generally something you think will be agreed with by the listener. However, な focuses almost exclusively on the speaker, and their own thoughts. Fun Fact よ and ね are very frequently combined together to make the sentence ender よ ね . This is used purely when you expect the listener will agree with you. Caution ね is much weaker than でしょう or だろう , and is sometimes said purely out of habit, without much nuance of 'right' at all."

In this way, it sounds similar to 'I wonder if (A)' in English. To use this construction, the statement before だろうか must be nominalized (turned into a noun-phrase). This is done through the use of の , or なの (in the case of な-Adjectives and nouns). Despite the grammatical rule relating to nominalization using の (or なの ), this part of the phrase is often omitted. だろうか is quite masculine, so in order to sound more polite/ladylike, でしょうか may also be used instead. Caution Although だろうか is quite masculine, it does not strictly mean that でしょうか is feminine. でしょうか may be used confidently by either women or men. Fun Fact Like だろう , だろうか may be used to ask a question, or simply to express the speaker's inner thoughts. However, だろうか is most commonly used to express a personal 'I wonder', in a similar way to かな . Because of this, even if it is used as a question, the listener may assume that you are not specifically looking for an answer from them."

In many cases, the interpretation will be 'it may well be (A)', 'it's only natural that (A)', or 'there's no wonder that (A)'. However, 尤 も itself is simply an adjective that affirms that the speaker understands the thought process behind (A), and that it is logical to them, regardless of whether or not they actually agree with it themselves. Due to this, 'it may well be (A)' in English is actually a very close translation of the feeling behind the expression. のももっともだ will appear with verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, and nouns. In the case of nouns, the の will be dropped, as the noun itself will become the expression being marked as the focus. Due to のももっともだ being used when the speaker is expressing that they understand the underlying reasons behind something, phrases used for explanation such as から or ので will often be seen in the same sentence."

This is achieved through the use of the particle の , in a similar way to its standard possessive use. The noun that would usually follow の is dropped, as it has either been said earlier in the sentence, or is understood clearly from context. In these examples, it would also be grammatically correct to use the same noun following の , but as can be seen in the English translation, it results in unnecessary repetition. This is called word stacking/redundant words ( 重 ね 言葉 ) in Japanese, and is considered a poor writing/speech habit. Despite this, it is important to know that this の is exactly the same as the possessive の (with the following word simply being left out). In the following sentence, we can see another common use of の that translates similarly to 'one' in English, when referring to non-specific things. From this, it is clear that the repeated noun is not needed. Japanese is a language that avoids repeating words in many situations. This example shows noun replacement, rather than noun omission, another common use of の which we will cover in another lesson."

In many cases, this will be when (A) is something that the speaker thinks is not worth considering, or not worth making an issue out of when (B) is more important. Fun-fact The adverb 兎 も 角 is thought to have come from the Buddhist expression 兎角亀毛 , meaning 'horns on rabbits, fur on turtles', referring to things that do not exist. Although this particular meaning is not widely accepted as being strongly related to the modern meaning of 兎 も 角 , some relation can be drawn between it and English phrases such as '(A) is neither here nor there' in reference to something that is non-existent, or of little importance."

In many cases, (A) will be a reason that is difficult to conceive of as what would lead to (B) under normal circumstances, and therefore requires the speaker to emphasize it with こそ.

The primary difference being that 必要 がある highlights the need to 'do (A)', and will therefore be used with verbs (without the need for nominalization). To use 必要 がある , just attach it after the plain form of the verb that you want to highlight the 'need' for. As we can see, this construction is simply the combination of a verb + 必要 (creating a verb modified noun), the case marking particle が , and the う-Verb ある . In this way, it just means 'the need of doing (A) exists'. Naturally, this grammar pattern may also be used negatively, to highlight that there is 'no need to do (A)', or that 'doing (A) is not necessary'."

This will be translated as 'for the purpose of (A), (B)', 'in order to (A), (B)', or 'to ensure that (A), (B)'. べく itself will only attach to verbs that can be done intentionally, with some purpose in mind. The (B) part of べく sentences will also indicate an intentional action that will be performed in order to reach the goal of (A). When combining する with べく , due to べく being a classical auxiliary verb , it will attach to the classical stem of する, す. However, in modern Japanese it is fairly common to see both すべく and するべく , with both forms being considered correct. べく itself is a very formal structure in modern Japanese, so will rarely be used in standard speech. Fun Fact Although べし and all of its conjugations have slightly different translations based on the grammar points that they appear in, the underlying meaning can be stemmed from the originating kanji 可 し, meaning 'to be permissible'. The focus with this kanji and all forms of べし are just that the word it is attached to is being marked as a strong goal. This means that rather than 'in order to (A)', べく is closer to 'to attain (A)', in that it adds further emphasis."

However, unlike expressions such as くらい (which focuses more on the speaker's uncertainty about the exact number), ほど puts emphasis on the upper (or lower) limit of something as having been 'reached'. Due to this, it is usually translated as 'so much that (A)', or 'to the extent that (A)'. ほど can be added on to the end of the attributive form of any word. The attributive form being the form that is able to be partnered directly with nouns. Caution Although くらい may be used to describe something that is 'around' a certain extent (regardless of whether it is above or below that extent), 程 refers specifically to the 'limit' of something, and therefore cannot be used to describe something that exceeds the stated limit. Due to this, it is regularly used to express some sort of exaggerated limit of (A), when the real extent is far below that."

This may seem confusing at first, but it may be easier to think of また as meaning 'repetition of (A)', where (A) is any particular course of action. This repetition is a bit different to English, in that it can express the same action, or an alternative option. また can be used as an adverb , or as a conjunction . In this lesson, we will focus on its use as a conjunction. As with many other conjunctions in Japanese, a phrase/sentence can begin with また , so long as that sentence expresses a complete thought. Due to また being quite different to any single word that we have in English, let's try to make the meaning a bit clearer. Imagine that '(A) action always has (B) result'. However, the action which leads to the (B) result could be many different things. Because of this, また can have the following meanings. The same (A) action is taken - Has the nuance of 'again', or 'moreover'. A different (A) action is taken - Has the nuance of 'also', and 'additionally'."

As can be assumed by the use of まで, the primary nuance of までもない is that while there may be some sort of slight issue or problem, the speaker does not consider it as being something that has reached a point that is worth being concerned about. It may also indicate that because something is obvious, it does not need to be confirmed, etc. Caution When coming between an (A) and a (B) phrase, the conjunctive form までもなく will be used, but this is less common."

This is regularly translated as 'rather', or 'instead'. むしろ will mostly appear at the beginning of new sentences, or the beginning of a second clause within a sentence, before information about (A) will be clarified. As むしろ seeks to give a more accurate description about something, it will often be paired with grammar patterns such as より, to show where the comparison is being made. Fun Fact むしろ comes from the kanji 寧 ろ, literally meaning 'preferable'. This is the same kanji that appears in the word 丁寧 , meaning 'polite' (sometimes also translated as 'careful'). The grammar structure むしろ itself may even be translated as 'preferably', simply expressing that careful consideration has been given to describing something accurately."

This structure is seen with verbs, い-Adjectives, and な-Adjectives followed by の, but may also follow nouns without the addition of の. Occasionally, にも may be used instead of も for further emphasis. も 構 わず is used most frequently to express that (A) is something that is either being ignored or that the speaker is not worried about. The (B) part of the statement will regularly highlight something that is being without any consideration for (A). This comes from the standard 'to brace', or 'to give pause' meaning of 構 う."

This grammar structure can simply be thought of as an extension of から 'because', with the noun もの 'thing' having its usual role of emphasizing what is said before it. Common translations include 'because (A)', and 'the reason is (A)'. ものだから may appear directly after verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns that are followed with な. Occasionally, ものだから will be abbreviated to もので , or もんで , without any change in the overall meaning. The change of だ to its conjunctive form で indicates that there is something coming after, despite the fact that what comes after may sometimes be omitted if it is obvious. Fun-fact Although it is not a rule, ものだから will primarily be used when explaining one's actions, as a way of emphasizing that the situation of (A) specifically led to the speaker doing (B)."

Common translations include ‘If you were to (A), (B)’, of ‘if (A) happens, (B)’. In this particular use of ものなら , (A) will be a verb in its volitional form, and (B) will be some sort of negative result that would come about from that. Let’s have a look at a few examples. Keeping in mind that the volitional form can mean to approach an action with reckless abandon, it can be thought of as being similar to the English ‘to go and do (A)’, where the ‘to go and’ just indicates proceeding ahead without carefully considering the outcome. Fun Fact なら is often translated as ‘if’ in many textbooks and online resources, but knowing that it is just a conjugation of だ ‘is’, the more literal translation is ‘were’. This ‘were’ behaves exactly the same way in English in hypothetical situations, so may potentially be better if you would like to avoid confusion between other ‘if’ grammar patterns like ば, と, and たら. An example of this can be seen in sentences like ‘were it to rain tomorrow, then I would need an umbrella’. Because of this, it is recommended to memorize なら purely as ‘were’, rather than the ‘if’ interpretation that is usually attached to it."

Literally, it just means 'it's an (A) thing!'. もの is quite casual, so should be avoided in formal situations. To use もの as 'because', attach it to the end of the plain form of any word. To emphasize もの even further, the explanatory んだ (after a verb or い-Adjective ), or なんだ (after a な-Adjective or noun) will often be used. Caution もの can be shortened to もん in its use as a sentence ending particle. However, this makes the statement sound far more 'cute' or 'childish'. Due to this, it should be avoided in standard conversation.

Multiple meanings like this are quite common for Japanese particles, as there is no need to use different words simply to agree with other statements in the sentence (unlike English). As you can see here, English requires 'either/neither (when negative)', or 'too/also', but Japanese only requires も . You can think of it as simply meaning 'Whatever is true for (A), is also true for (B)'. も is part of many other compound grammar structures in which it keeps its original meaning, but shifts the nuance a little bit. Some of these include でも , にも～ない , とも . As we can see, it is frequently paired with other particles! Here, も can be seen pairing with で . This suggests that 'With (A), (B) also'. This is regularly translated simply as 'but' in English, despite the nuance being closer to 'and also'."

To compare how と and や are different, imagine that there is a bowl of fruit. In this bowl there are apples, oranges, and peaches. If と is used to list the apples and oranges, it would give the listener the impression that there are no peaches. This is called an 'exhaustive' list, meaning that all possibilities should be listed. However, if や is used, the listener would know that there are other things in the bowl apart from the apples and oranges. In this way, や is a better choice when you want to say 'and', but don't want to limit the group that you are listing. Caution や cannot be used after verb phrases. This is done with たり , or とか ."

This is a combination of either of the auxiliary verbs う or よう, ではない, and the sentence-ending particle, か. う and よう primarily express will or intent like 'shall' in English. Due to the negation following them, the literal translation will be similar to 'shall we not do (A)?'. For ease of translation, this structure can be remembered as simply 'let's do (A)', or 'why don't we do (A)'. As with all structures that use う or よう, ようではないか will be attached to the end of a verb indicating the action which is being suggested. Alternatively, the abbreviated form of じゃない may be used in place of ではない. Despite this, ようではないか is primarily a formal grammar structure, so will most often use the unabbreviated version, or even more polite ようではありませんか construction. Fun-fact Occasionally, this grammar structure may be seen preceded by もらう. In these cases, it is usually challenging the listener to do something. This can be interpreted as 'why don't I have you do (A) then'."

As ようだ is being linked to the verb する , it will take on its adverbial form, ように . This structure emphasizes that the (A) action (always a verb) is something that the speaker is going out of their way to do, and implies effort. Naturally, this structure may also be used with a negative verb, to imply that (A) being done is something that is actively being avoided. This translates as 'to make sure not to do (A)'. Fun Fact Because ようだ comes from the kanji 様 'manner', it carries the nuance that the 'way' that someone is doing (A) is specifically in a way that has success as the goal. Literally it translates quite closely to 'to do (A) in the manner of getting it done', and therefore just strengthens the (A) action, by using 'to do' twice."

Due to this, 予定 is used far more frequently for things that you have formal plans to do (like meeting a friend for lunch). To use 予定 , just attach it to the non-past form of a verb, or to a noun (after inserting の ). Caution If だ or です is not added after 予定 , it will imply that 予定 is simply modifying the verb/noun that comes before it, rather than being a standalone 'plan'. This is similar to the difference between saying something like 'I have plans to eat with a friend' (natural), vs 'I have an eating with a friend plan' (unnatural)."

However, in this lesson, we will take a look at how this case marking particle can be used by itself. When used alone, this particle expresses that (A) (a noun or verb) is being compared to (B) (a noun or verb that is regularly paired with an adjective). The word that より is directly attached to will always be 'less than' the comparison being made. However, the overall expression is used to describe that (B) is 'more' (something) than (A). Caution In many textbooks, より is taught as meaning 'more', but the word that より is attached to will actually be the thing that is 'less' (something). The word/quote that has が attached to it will be the thing that is 'more' (adjective). This is particularly confusing when より is not directly attached to a word, something which is common in casual spoken language. In this sentence, because the が is attached to これ , これ is the thing that is 'more expensive'. As より is not actually directly connected to any other word, it therefore means that これ is expensive, compared to 'other things'. When you see より like this, just pretend that it says 'other things' before it."

This 'etc' is where the implication of 'more than one' originates. To use ら , attach it to the end of any pronoun. Caution Because ら has a literal meaning that is close to '(A) etc', or '(A) and so on', it may sometimes be considered a bit rude (due to being dismissive). Because of this, it is recommended to not use this suffix in relation to people, unless it is absolutely essential to indicate plural. In most cases, 達 will be a far better choice."

This pattern simply involves the replacement of る with another construction, depending on the tense of the verb ( past , negative , etc). This conjugation pattern that only includes る is where the Japanese name Ichidan ( 一段 ) 'one-level' comes from. In these examples, we can see that る is removed from the verb to create the polite ます form. The る form of the verb is often called 'plain form', 'casual form', or 'short form', depending on the source/book. All る-Verbs end in the kana る, there are no exceptions to this rule. Caution While all る-Verbs end in る, not all verbs that end in る are る-Verbs . These verbs can be identified by the る changing, rather than being removed when conjugated. As the る in 取 る becomes り in 取 ります, we can determine immediately that it is not a る-Verb , but actually a う-Verb ."

Naturally, this determination may sometimes be negative, as is the case with わけではない. ではない being the conjugated form of the auxiliary verb だ , the adverbial particle は, and the い-Adjective ない. わけではない may be translated as 'it doesn't mean that (A)', or 'it's not the case that (A)'. Although, 'it is not necessarily so that it's (A)', or 'so it's not (A)' are closer to the actual nuance of わけ. わけではない can be used at the end of any sentence, so long as the word before わけ is in attributive form . As always, では may be replaced by じゃ. Fun Fact わけだ and わけではない match the explanatory meaning of 'so' in English that often replaces words like 'because' and 'since'. However, as we will examine in more detail in the わけがない grammar point, わけ also matches the emphatic nuance of 'so', as can be seen in statements like 'it's SO not (A)'."

                        "content": "As mentioned in the わ grammar point, わ is an adverbial particle that is commonly used in cases of stress of emphasis in Japanese. When used after either verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns in their standard forms , it generally implies that (A) and (B) are negative factors that have lead to (C), where (C) is either a negative outcome, or a negative opinion. It will often be translated simply as 'with (A) and (B), (C)'. To use this structure, simply place わ after a word, and then repeat the same after a second (different) word. In the case of な-Adjective or nouns, だわ will be used. The case-marking particle で will then follow the second わ, indicating 'with', or 'as a consequence of'. わ～わで , like わ , primarily emphasizes the speaker's surprise in regard to the words that appear before it. However, unlike わ , where the same verb will be repeated in order to highlight an excessive extent, わ～わで simply indicates surprise in terms of irritation or frustration. This structure is predominantly used by men, but it may also sometimes be used by women. However, there are several different variations of わ depending on where they appear in sentences, each of which have gender usage tendencies that will need to be learned. In essence, わ is used in the same way as し～し, where the words that they are being attached to are just being listed as reasons. Additionally, the で may occasionally be omitted. Fun Fact わ is simply an emphatic version of the usual は adverbial particle , and originates from は being changed to わ. Due to this, the literal meaning can be thought of as a stronger version of the standard 'as for (A)' meaning of は. Caution While this grammar pattern is used almost exclusively with a negative nuance, it may, in rare cases, have a positive nuance."

It may be translated as 'ignoring (A)', or 'disregarding (A)'. It is a combination of the adverbial particle を, the noun 余所 'other place', and the case-marking particle に. Due to this, its literal meaning is close to 'putting (A) completely aside, (B)'. This structure will follow nouns, or phrases that have been nominalized with の. It is reasonably formal, so will be seen more often in writing. The most common pattern for をよそに to follow is that (A) expresses some overall situation, while (B) indicates an action that is being done without any thought or care given toward those circumstances. Because of this, it is often used critically about actions that are seen as irresponsible. Caution While this grammar point will primarily highlight the actions of people, it will not be used to refer to the speaker's own actions."

In this way, it literally means 'to not be given another way than to (A)'. を 余儀 なくされる will be seen following an (A) noun, where (A) is the thing that is unavoidable. In most cases, the subject of sentences that use を 余儀 なくされる will be a person, or something that is representative of people, such as a company. However, there are exceptions to this. Caution Both を 余儀 なくされる 'to be forced to do' and を 余儀 なくさせる 'to force to do' are variations of the same grammar structure. を 余儀 なくさせる will be taught in a different lesson. Fun Fact Despite 余儀 and ない being separate words, 余儀 なく is often thought of simply as a single word that means 'unavoidably', or 'inevitably'."

This 'through' may either indicate a method, or a location. 通 じる 'to flow', or 'to go through' and 通 す 'to make a path', only differ in that the former is intransitive, while the latter is transitive. Because of this, 通 じる will be seen more often in regard to information or communication where (A) is the connection through which (B) occurs. 通 す on the other hand more often refers to direct locations through which something is transferred or relocated. As this expression begins with を, it will appear after nouns, before expressing in the (B) part of the sentence exactly what was done 'through' (A). Caution The primary difference between を 通 じて and を 通 して lies in the intransitive and transitive nature of the verbs themselves. Due to this, things that are being done 'intentionally', or 'by use of (A)' will tend to use を 通 して . を 通 じて is more common when something is being done 'throughout (A)'."

This means that the subject (the person or thing performing an action) is performing that action with the object being the goal/target of the action. In most cases, whatever を is attached to will not actually be 'doing' anything, but will instead have something being done to it. In these sentences, を is marking the thing that is having an action performed 'on' it. This is how the Japanese language views the ' object '. However, unlike English, an object can also be a place in which an action is performed 'through', if the goal of that action is based in that location itself. In these sentences, を is marking the place 'through' which the action is taking place. This use of を highlights that the place itself is what is being interacted with (running/walking requires interaction with the ground, so the ground/place is the object)."

In this way, it translates quite similarly to 'it is that (A) was said/thought'. Realistically though, it is used in the same way as 'I heard that (A)', or 'it's thought that (A)'. Caution なんだって usually comes across as being quite casual, so is best used in conversations with friends."

It may be interpreted as 'once (A), (B)', 'since (A), (B)', 'now that (A), (B)', or 'as long as (A), (B)'. In these meanings, (B) will always be something that is deemed as either obvious or necessary. 上 in this phrase is a noun , and will be attached to the adverbial particle は. This creates a literal meaning that is similar to 'over and above (A), (B)'. This 'over and above' has a similar nuance to 'with that said', or 'all things considered' in English, and just presents (A) as something that is finalized. This structure follows verbs in the standard form . Due to 上 は being quite old-fashioned, expressions like からには or 以上 は will be heard more frequently in modern-day Japanese, and will carry a similar meaning."

                        "content": "As a suffix , 中 is frequently used to highlight a period of time (or space). By attaching the case marking particle に , the sentence can be modified, to show that (B) is happening/existing throughout the timeframe/space of (A). This is often translated as 'throughout (A), (B)', or 'during (A), (B)'. First, let's take a look at 中 being used to show events that are in process. Now, to show that a (B) event is happening within (A), simply add the case marking particle に to show a 'temporal location'. This will be done by attaching に to the end of any noun that you would like to indicate as the being the 'space' within which another thing exists/occurs. In these examples, we can see that 中 に is sometimes read/said as 中 に. The basic rule for when to use ちゅう or when to use じゅう is as follows: 中 に - Expresses a very specific (usually small) amount of time/space, or something that is not always the same (an amount of time/space that can change, depending on the person/situation). This 'thing' that ちゅう highlights is usually a 'process', and therefore means that (A) is 'in the process' of happening. Examples - A meeting, class, visit to somewhere. 中 に - Expresses a predetermined amount of time/space that will always remain the same, regardless of the person/situation. Therefore, じゅう does not highlight a 'process', but focuses on the 'length' or 'space' itself. This tends to mean 'all throughout', as it focuses on the full amount of time/space. Examples - A day, year, house, town or country. Caution There is also a difference between 音読 み (chinese readings of words), and 訓読 み (japanese readings of words). じゅう is used more frequently with 訓読 み - ( 今年中 , 夏休 み 中 , 今晩中 ). ちゅう is used more frequently with 音読 み - ( 水中 , 会議中 , 試合中 )."

It should also be noted that 傾向 がある may be used both in instances where the trend is either positive or negative.

Due to this, 切 る is often translated as 'to do (A) to the point of being unable to continue' (or not needing to continue), or 'to totally and utterly do (A)'. Occasionally, 切 る may also be used to show that (A) is being done at 'full pelt', 'full steam', or 'full capacity'. In these cases, it is similar to 'to resolutely do (A)', and just means that 100% effort is being put into the action."

Due to 向 き being intransitive, it usually implies that something is facing toward (A) naturally, or through chance.

Caution 向 け, coming from the transitive verb 向 ける is used far more often to express that something has been specifically designed for (A).

Just like よう, ごとし (written primarily in hiragana) focuses on the appearance of (A) based on observation. Due to this, ごとし may be translated as 'like (A)', 'similar to (A)', or 'as if it were (A)'. ごとし is the base form of this auxiliary verb , but ごとく (the conjunctive form ), and ごとき (the attributive form ) will also be seen. As only ごとき is attributive, it may be followed directly by other nouns, while ごとし most often comes at the end of sentences. ごとく acts as an adverb when preceding verbs, but may also be seen before breaks in clauses. Let's look at a few examples of each form. Like よう, ごとし and its variations will follow の when coming after a noun. However, it will follow が when coming after a verb. As ごとし is old-fashioned, it will primarily be encountered in books, rather than in speech. Fun Fact The kanji 如 itself has a meaning very similar to the word 'likeness' in English, indicating something that resembles (A) in every sense of the word, but is not actually (A). This kanji can be seen in several common words in Japanese such as 如何 'how'."

Caution 得 る may be seen as either える or うる. The primary difference between the two being that うる is a relatively old form that is often seen in literature, and spoken far less frequently than える. Despite this, there is a tendency for うる to be the preferred spoken choice when the kana that appears before it is え, such as 教 える becoming 教 え うる , rather than 教 え える . Fun Fact 得 る is far more formal/bookish than できる. However, there are several set phrases that are very common in daily speech that use this particular grammar point, such as あり 得 る 'possible', and あり 得 ない 'impossible'."

Regarding verbs, it expresses 'going forward from (A), (B)'. This is usually in relation to something that has happened either accidentally or completely, and may represent what will be done as a result of being in that situation. This can also be interpreted as 'now that (A), (B)', and simply highlights that nothing can be done except to move on or 'forward' given the current circumstances. When 手前 appears with nouns followed by the case marking particle の, it often expresses that what is 'in front' of (A) is the reason for (B), or simply is 'in front of (B)'. Despite the many translations, 手前 always shows something that is 'facing' the noun or verb that appears with it. Due to this, thinking of this structure as similar to 'faced with (A), (B)' may be helpful, as English also expresses lack of option and finality in this way."

As the kanji 最 means 'utmost', we can see that the literal meaning is 'utmost middle'. This can be translated in a similar way to phrases like 'at the height of (A)', or 'in the midst of (A)', in English. When using 最中 に , a (B) part of the sentence will usually highlight something else that happened during (A), somehow interrupting or disturbing it. To use 最中 に , attach it to the end of the ている form of a verb, or a noun followed by の. Caution 最中 may also occasionally be used with adjectives, but this is uncommon. In these cases, the meaning is to be at the 'pinnacle' of whatever the adjective is describing (usually a feeling/emotion)."

The first use is very similar to 'as' or 'for' in English, and means 'considering/within the category of (A), (B)'. The second use primarily relates to people, and will be covered later. As a single word, 的 is often likened to adjective endings such as '~ly', '~like', and '~al'. To use 的 , attach it to the end of a noun that you want to express as being the focus point of either a verb or a noun that will come later in the sentence. When describing a noun, 的 will be followed by な (meaning that it becomes a な-Adjective ). When describing a verb, it will be followed by に (making it an adverb). Fun Fact The second common use of 的 is specifically with the names of people, and highlights that (B) is something that is being considered in regard to (A). (A) being the person mentioned. This may be used either positively or negatively. In English, this is similar to 'that's so (A)', or 'just what you'd expect of (A)'. Fun Fact The easiest way to understand and use 的 correctly almost all the time, is by knowing another common suffix , 圏 . Let's look at how these suffixes compare: 圏 - Occurring in the sphere of (A), (B). (B) only happens inside of (A). 的 - Speaking in the sphere of (A), (B). (B) can only be said within the sphere of (A). As we can see here, when you want to convey something that can be said from a specific standpoint, 的 will be a logical choice."

When using 見 える , (A) will always be followed by が . However, the 'way that something looks' will be marked adverbially. This means that an い-Adjective will be changed to its く form, and な-Adjectives /nouns will be followed by に . This usage of 見 える will be covered more in our focused lesson on this particular grammar structure. Fun Fact The primary difference between 見 える , and 見 られる (the potential form of 見 る), is that 見 える is used to identify things that do not require the active concentration of the spectator to be seen. In other words, seeing it is unavoidable (if looking in its direction of course). However, 見 られる is used when the onlooker, is trying to concentrate on some specific object, and is referring to their 'ability' to see it. Fun Fact 見 える is also sometimes used to describe the 'sense' of sight, and refers to whether anything is visible at all for the speaker."

The primary meanings are as follows: (A) 込 む - To enter completely into doing (A), or the state of being in (A). (A) 込 む - To enter a state of doing (A) that will not be considered complete until 'success'. (A) 込 む - To enter a state of doing (A) that cannot be escaped from. In this lesson, we will exclusively focus on the second and third meanings, which are usually translated as 'to remain in (A)', 'to thoroughly do (A)', 'to do (A) deeply', or 'to do (A) intensely'. This form will be attached to the conjunctive form of other verbs. Despite the multiple meanings, 込 む can almost always be thought of as 'jamming (B) into (A)'. This means that whatever the (A) action is, will be something that is not easily entered, but also not easily escaped from."

This is as in 'to be on the verge', and translates mostly as 'on the occasion of (A)', 'at the time of (A)', 'in case of (A)', or 'when (A)'. In the same way as 'verge' in English, it implies a fairly big or somehow important event, and will not be used with standard occurrences. 際 に will appear after verbs in either their dictionary or past-tense forms, and after nouns. In the case of nouns, it will be preceded by の. While (A) is likely to be a temporary or one-off event, 際 に is not limited to one-off situations. It may also appear with regularly occurring events, but the way of reacting to that event may change depending on some one-off circumstances. Caution Although 際 に and 時 に may overlap in certain situations, 際 に will sound unnatural when the situation involves something that typically does not change, or always happens the same way."

Depending on the form of the verb, ところに may indicate being 'on the verge of (A)', 'partway through (A)', or having 'just finished (A)'. Compared to other ところ based structures, the addition of に or へ will often precede a (B) statement indicating that 'at the precise moment of (A), (B) happened'. This may either be positive or negative. Caution In many cases, ところに will be used when (A) is either a 'situation' or an 'emotion', and will not often be used in relation to unimportant or trivial actions, unless expressing the 'precise moment' where something unexpected happened during that trivial action. Caution When appearing with nouns, な-Adjectives, or い-Adjectives, ところに , へ, で, and を simply highlight that 'state of (A)'."

In this way, the more literal meaning is 'for (A), (A) is not possible'. It will be important to keep in mind that する does not have a potential form, so できない will be used in the latter half of this expression when paired with する verbs. Additionally, ない may sometimes be replaced with other structures that convey negation, such as ず. Caution Occasionally, the dictionary form of a verb will be replaced with the auxiliary verb う or よう volitional forms, and will then be followed by にも. The potential form of the same verb coming before ない will remain the same. Although the meanings are the same between both of these, the dictionary form tends to highlight psychological circumstances for why one 'cannot (A)', while the volitional form highlights more concrete or physical circumstances."

This is quite emphatic, and has a literal meaning similar to 'say it does (A) or say it doesn't (A), it will still be (B)'. As a reminder, the positive auxiliary verbs of volition are either う or よう, depending on what they are being connected to, while the negative auxiliary verb of volition is まい. Either the case marking particle が or と will appear after both the positive and the negative, with が being slightly more common. While this structure is primarily seen after verbs, it is important to remember that other auxiliary verbs such as だ can be conjugated in the same way, as can い-Adjectives with the less common かろう structure. This means that both nouns, な-Adjectives and い-Adjectives can also appear using a similar grammar pattern. However, because the negative volitional まい cannot pair with these structures, an antonym will usually appear with them instead, with both words using the う or よう positive volitional. Based primarily on the use of volitionals, this grammar pattern will often indicate the speaker's strong will or opinion that will not change regardless of (A)."

Therefore, the literal meaning is just that something is 'the limit of (A)', where (A) is some describable feature. 限 りだ will follow adjectives in their standard form s. 限 りだ is a fairly formal grammar point that simply aims to highlight the intensity of traits as perceived by the speaker. As this perception is something coming from the speaker, the adjective itself will often be an emotion that the speaker themselves is experiencing, rather than a direct quality of the object, such as its color or shape. Some examples of this are as follows. 嬉 しい - The feeling of happiness, as experienced by the speaker. 頼 もしい - The feeling of reliability, as experienced by the speaker. 羨 ましい - The feeling of jealousy, as experienced by the speaker. 寂 しい - The feeling of lonliness, as experienced by the speaker. 恥 ずかしい - The feeling of embarrassment, as experienced by the speaker. 心強 い - The feeling of reassurance, as experienced by the speaker. As can be seen in all of the examples. The intensity of the adjective is something that will change depending on one speaker to the next, rather than something that the target is doing."

These sentences will be from the perspective of the person who has 'been made to do' something, and are very often negative (against the will of the speaker). First, verbs must be conjugated in the same way that they would be with せる , or させる . After that simply remove the る, and then add られる . This will create the verb form させられる (linked with る-Verbs ), or せられる (linked with う-Verbs ). As with the causative form, する and 来 る have special conjugation rules. する will be replaced completely by させられる , while 来 る will become 来 させられる . Caution Unlike with causative verbs, where the actual doer of a sentence (marked with が ) is considered to be the person who 'caused' the action, られる reverses the perspective. This makes the doer (marked with が ) the person who is being 'forced' to do something. When the person that is 'causing' the action appears in a causative-passive sentence, they will be marked with に . Caution れる may not be used in place of られる in causative-passive sentences. This is because せる and させる both have せ (an え sound kana) at the point where they will connect with られる . This is a rule for all verbs with an え sound kana at their conjugation point (excluding the 'potential' use of れる and られる )."

The primary reading of both of these kanji is かた, but becomes がた due to 連濁 (sound changes due to conjugation). 型 can be attached directly to the end of nouns, or to い-Adjectives . Occasionally, 型 will be used after the case marking particle の. In these cases, because it is connected to の, and not directly to the noun, it will be read as かた, not がた. Although there are two different kanji that can be used in this expression, 型 will be used far more frequently than 形 . This is primarily due to the base meanings that these kanji have. Those meanings are as follows: 型 - Form (in regard to design, pattern, type, or model). 形 - Shape (in regard to physical shapes only. Square, rectangle, triangle, etc). Due to this, 型 is used when describing any form/pattern that is abstract, while 形 is primarily only used for describing very basic (visible) shapes. Caution Occasionally, 型 may be read as 型 , the 音 読 み (Chinese reading) of 型 . This is primarily when it is paired with other words that also use their 音 読 み, or when it is not acting as a suffix , but part of a set word."

However, considering how common its usage has become, it may be used in almost any situation confidently."

                        "content": "In Japanese, there are several ways to express that something 'passively' happens. All of these are done with the auxiliary verbs れる and られる . Japanese verbs in the passive form behave in a slightly different way than they do in English, so we will examine this difference more closely later. For now, let's focus on れる , られる , and さ れる (the form used with する verbs). Passivity in Japanese means that the person (or thing) that is the target of the action will be the subject of the sentence, rather than the person that is 'doing' whatever verb is being used. You can conjugate any Japanese verb into the passive form in the following way. For う-Verbs (godan verbs), simply replace the last kana with the equivalent あ sound kana from the same row (す becomes さ, つ becomes た, ぶ becomes ば, う becomes わ, like with ない, and so on), then add れる , or られる . For る-Verbs (ichidan verbs), just replace the る with られる . する and くる behave slightly differently than most other verbs. For する , it will become さ れる , while くる will become こ られる . As can be seen in these examples, the 'doer' of the verb will be marked with に , but から can also be used in cases where there is no physical contact with the subject. Caution られる can be used in several different situations. These are listed below. Passive: 受 け 身 - Something happens to the subject as a result of an external force (sometimes sounds negative). Possible: 可能 - There is the possibility for something to be done. Spontaneous: 自発 - Something happens by itself, or 'without instigation'. Respectful: 尊敬 - You are respecting someone by making them the subject of the sentence, despite someone else actually performing the verb. Fun Fact In Japanese, passivity focuses on the lack of control of the subject of the sentence. Due to this, the subject will sometimes be called the なる人, while the doer of the verb is called the する 人. Traditionally, many textbooks use the term ' passive ', simply because there is no equivalent verb type in English ( passive is the closest). However, we would like to introduce the term 'displacement verb'. This just means that the subject of the sentence is being described in a similar way to what happens in keigo (polite speech). Caution But wait, what about れる with る-Verbs ! Well, in Japanese, ら removal words 'ラ 抜 き 言葉 ' are very common. These are words that are able to use れる , instead of られる . The original meaning of both of these auxiliary verbs is exactly the same, but there are cases where ら may not be removed. The standard rules are as follows. ら may be removed - る-Verbs and くる , when the meaning is 'possible'. ら may not be removed - る-Verbs and くる , when the meaning is 'passive', 'spontaneous', or 'respectful'. In both of these sentences, the meaning is exactly the same. However, ラ 抜 き may only be used when られる is being used to highlight ' possibility '."

This is similar to the contrastive use of は . In order to identify this nuance of て , we will need to think about whether the things being described are happening one after the other, or are simply describing '(A), and then (B)'. Let's look at some examples. Due to this 'contrast' that is shown with て , sometimes it is translated as 'while (A), also (B)'. The primary difference between this nuance of て , and other 'while' or 'but' grammar points, is that (A) and (B) will always have equal weight/importance in a て sentence. Comparatively, structures like けど , のに , だが and similar points will usually imply that either (A) or (B) is more important in some way."

This is a formal structure, and will be seen far more often in literature than it will be spoken. Despite this, it is actually quite common in anime and manga when characters are being dramatic. As (A) presents a 'minimum', it will often be a word which expresses something that depicts the difference between reality and fantasy. For example, if (A) was 想像 するだに 'even in my imagination'. The 'minimum' is the imagination, for which the opposite end of the spectrum would be 'in reality'."

The case marking particle と in this expression highlights a 'result'. To use おうとする , modify the (A) verb into its う or よう receiving form, and then add とする. As う and よう mark volition (the express intent to do something), とする adds the nuance that the express intent has been decided, and all that remains is to 'do' the action. This translates quite closely to 'to endeavor to do' in English, where the past form 'endeavored to do' will suggest that the attempt was unsuccessful. Caution ようとする is also regularly used to indicate when one action interrupts another. In these cases, the nuance is not quite 'to have endeavored', but more '(A) was already underway, when (B)'. Again, it will just show that the (A) action was decided upon 100%, when something caused an unexpected change."
