The place that あそこ will be used to identify is somewhere that is separated from both the speaker and the listener. This translates roughly to 'that place over there' in English. あそこ can be used to identify both physical locations, and emotional ones. In the same way that あれ can be used to point back to something that was mentioned previously, あそこ can be used to point back to a place that was mentioned previously. However, unlike それ or そこ , あれ and あそこ will only be used this way when both the speaker and listener have intimate knowledge of the topic. Caution あそこ should not be confused with あっち, a similar word which is also sometimes translated as 'over there'. あっち focuses more on the direction that one is/is going, while あそこ focuses purely on 'that place'."

Often, あまりに is translated simply as 'so much (A) that (B)', or 'way too much (A)'. In the last example, we can see that あまり will be followed by の when linked to a noun. Occasionally, にも will be used instead of に . This just emphasizes the 'excess' of (A) further. As the literal meaning of あまりに is quite close to 'excessively', it may be easier to remember this translation, rather than 'so much (A) that (B)'. Usually, 'it is excessively (A), so (B)' will cover most possible nuances. Caution あんまり is a colloquial variant of あまり that is often said, but should be avoided in any form of formal/official writing."

However, unlike どんな (which is an abbreviation of どのような), いくら is a noun that comes from the kanji 幾 ら, meaning 'how much'. When partnered with ても (with verbs and い-Adjectives ), or でも (with nouns and な-Adjectives ), the literal meaning means 'however much (A), (B)'. With いくら～でも, the (B) part of the phrase will usually highlight something that is being negated, giving the phrase it's 'no matter how much' nuance. Despite this trend of being used in sentences that contain ない or ありません, いくら～でも may also be seen in positive sentences. In these cases, despite not being negative, the (B) phrase will still be something that is surprising/unexpected in some way (due to its extent or amount). Fun Fact 幾 ら places more emphasis on the 'amount' of something, while どんなに places more emphasis on the 'type', or 'style'. Due to this, いくら will be a better choice when the 'volume' of something is being highlighted, while どんなに will sound more natural when the 'state' is being discussed. Despite this small difference, いくら and どんなに are used fairly interchangeably in most situations."

It will never be used when referring to the speaker themselves, or their own actions. いらっしゃる can be used to replace 居 る 'to be', 来 る 'to come', or 行 く 'to go'. This is due to the unique perspective that honorific language places the speaker in, in relation to the person that is being respected. This is a slightly advanced concept that we will discuss more later. To use いらっしゃる , simply replace いる , くる , or いく with いらっしゃる . Alternatively, いらっしゃる may also be used to replace いる , くる , or いく when they are attached to the て-form of another verb. Fun Fact おいでになる is another expression which can replace いる , くる , or いく. This was briefly examined previously in our お～になる grammar point. おいでになる and いらっしゃる are almost completely interchangable."

However, depending on the type of word used, conjugation rules will differ slightly. For い-Adjectives , they are simply attached to the front of the noun in their standard (dictionary) form. Caution When identifying what is an い-Adjective , and what is not, remember that an い-Adjective will always have the い outside of any kanji that are in the word. However, the reverse situation with な-Adjectives always having the い in the kanji is not true 100% of the time. 面白 い - The い is outside of the kanji, so 'interesting' is almost definitely an い-Adjective . 綺麗 - The い is inside of the kanji, so 'clean' is definitely not an い-Adjective . One example of an exception as mentioned above is 嫌 い. Despite the い being outside of the kanji, 'hate' is actually a な-Adjective . Don't worry though, less than 1% of any adjective that has い on the outside of the kanji will actually be a な-Adjective !"

For the ませんでした (polite) form, rather than the final kana changing to the あ sound kana from the same column, it will change to the い sound kana from the same column. The negative past form is used to convey that something 'did not happen', or 'was not'. A semi-polite form may also be used. This is constructed by using なかった , and then simply adding です . This form is not grammatically correct, but is so common that most sources (and native speakers) would consider it correct. ある is an exception to the regular conjugation rules of う-Verbs . The casual past-negative is not あらなかった, but simply なかった . However, the polite past-negative form conjugates in the same way as would be expected for う-Verbs. ありませんでした ."

This structure stems from the common use of the noun お 負 け which indicates a 'discount' or 'freebie' that is added in addition to the base of (A). Despite お 負 け itself primarily being used for positive things お 負 けに may convey 'in addition', 'on top of that', or 'what's more' regardless of whether the original topic is a good thing or not. However, (A) and (B) will always either be both good things, or both bad things, never a mixture of both. Being a combination of お 負 け and に, this phrase will appear either at the beginning of a new sentence, or at the beginning of a second clause of a 2-part sentence. Fun-fact An important distinction between phrases like それに and お 負 けに is that お 負 けに keeps its original meaning of (B) being some kind of 'bonus'. What this means is that whatever the speaker is trying to convey, (A) by itself is enough to meet some specific qualifications, and (B) is just adding 'insult to injury', or 'icing on the cake', depending on whether it is a good or a bad thing."

                        "content": "お〜する comes from a form of polite speech in Japanese called humble speech . This type of speech is used to refer to the speaker and their actions. This is opposed to honorific language , which refers exclusively to the listener and their actions. お〜する is almost exactly the same as お～になる , as in it simply means する . お〜する is regularly used with words of Japanese origin, while ご～する will be used with words of Chinese origin. The する in this compound will attach directly to the ます stem of almost any verb. Caution While the する in this structure will attach directly to the ます stem of verbs, this does not mean that verbs that are already する verbs will become しする. In the case of する verbs, simply change the prefix to ご. In rare cases, お may be used instead of ご, when attached to words of Chinese origin. There is no specific rule for this, and they must be memorized on a case by case basis. Thankfully, the words of Chinese origin that use お instead of ご are extremely common verbs. This means that you will be exposed to almost all of them very quickly. All others may be assumed to use ご. Fun Fact In the same way that お～になる is a more common variation of なさる (both honorific language ), お〜する is a more common variation of いたす (both humble speech )."

                        "content": "Being an unofficial helper verb, かけ is what is known as a 造語 (neologism), and carries one specific meaning when used in conjunction with other words. This is  similar to 向 け . かけ comes from the verb 掛 ける 'to suspend', and may be attached to the conjunctive form or other verbs, in order to convey that they are 'unfinished'. Usually this translates as 'half (A)', 'about to (A)', or 'not yet finished (A)'. かけ behaves like a noun, so may be followed by the case marking particle の when attached directly to another noun, or by だ when at the end of a sentence. Occasionally, the verb 掛 ける itself may be used instead of the noun form, かけ . Fun Fact As the literal meaning of 掛 ける is 'to suspend', it expresses that something is stuck somewhere in the process of happening. This is similar to taking a photo of someone that is jumping. In the photo it will look like they are 'suspended', but that is only because one particular moment has been captured, somewhere between the start and the finish. かけ conveys exactly the same meaning, and therefore may be interpreted differently, depending on the verb it is paired with. With verbs that express a momentary action (something that cannot be 'half' done), かけ will convey that the action was 'on the verge of' happening. However, with verbs that are ongoing actions, かけ will simply imply that they are 'in the process' of being done."

Fun-fact As 兼 ねる means 'to spread across', this expression can be thought of as similar to 'to be a stretch' in English.

Caution からする tends to be used most frequently in regard to money, while からの will be used when referring to people and other general amounts.

(B) may just be considered as something done while doing (A), or as being done specifically because (A) is a good opportunity to do it. This structure may be used either with or without kanji, so it will be important to remember both. Fun-fact 掛 ける is one of the more difficult verbs in Japanese, as it does not have an exact counterpart in English. However, in most cases it just means to lay, extend, or place something across either a physical or metaphorical surface or span. In this way, it may help to remember (A) as the span from which (B) will occur."

When (A) is a noun, it will almost always be a noun that signifies some sort of physical movement. Unlike ながら, がてら focuses more on (A) being a good opportunity which can be utilized or taken advantage of in order to do (B). Fun Fact がてら is a vocal change of がてり, which originally comes from an abbreviation of the conjunctive form of 糅 つ, かて 'to mix together', and あり. So かてあり was abbreviated to かてり, which then went through sound changes to がてり and がてら . However, the 'being mixed together' meaning is still kept in the modern day nuance of this grammar point."

                        "content": "がる is a う-Verb that is primarily used as a suffix in Japanese. When used in this way, it means 'to act like (A)', or 'to show signs of being (A)', where (A) is the word that it is attached to. To use がる , you will need to link it to the stem form of an い-Adjective (simply remove the い), or to the stem form of a な-Adjective (do not include the な). がる is a verb which means 'to give the impression of (A)', or 'to act like (A)'. This is very important in Japanese, as you would not usually say how somebody else feels, unless they told you directly and you are simply repeating what you heard (in which case you would use the quotation particle と ). When you want to express the way you 'think' that someone else feels, but don't have any direct information about it, that is when がる would be natural to use. For example, if you see someone shivering in the cold, you would say something like the following. The main difference between がる , and がっている , is that がる will be used when a person usually/always acts a certain way, whereas がっている is more about the way someone/something is acting in any specific moment. Caution がる may also be used to describe yourself (in the third person). This is when you want to express the way you think that you act/are acting, or a way you assume other people view your behavior. Fun Fact The use of がっている to express an 'in the moment' way that someone is acting, is slowly becoming less and less common in modern Japanese. Regularly, そう will be used instead, to express that someone (or something) 'seems' a certain way."

This means that it marks someone or something that is performing an action, or it identifies someone or something as having a specific feature (this is usually a feature that the listener is not aware of). In both of these sentences, が puts focus on the thing performing an action/existing in some way (as opposed to any other thing). Because of this, が is usually said to highlight what comes before it, while は highlights what comes after it. が always shows the 'target' of a statement, when other targets also exist. This is why が is used to describe situations that are happening either 'in the moment', or 'individually of other things'. Because the group in this sentence is only one group out of many possible 'groups of people' that could be described, が will be used. Caution が is not usually used to describe something about yourself, unless you are intentionally describing yourself compared to other people. If you want to talk about yourself 'in general terms', は will sound more natural (there are exceptions)."

Let's look at verbs first. With verbs, きり is primarily used to show that (A) occurring was all that was required for (B). Usually, this results in some permanent consequence, or permanent change of opinion. In almost every situation, (A) is something that has only happened once, and きり can be interpreted as 'ever since'. When it comes to the use of きり with nouns or counters, it will express that something is happening with (A) as the limit 'nothing more, nothing less'. In other words, (A) is all that will be included in some particular situation/action. Caution きり may also be seen as っきり or キリ . There is no specific change in nuance, but っきり is the most common casual form."

In all of these cases, the addition of げ creates a new な-Adjective meaning '(A) seeming'. Due to this, げ may then be followed by either な or に, depending on whether it is altering a verb or a noun later in the sentence. げ is more subjective (based on the speaker's opinion) than そう, and is considered to be very low confidence. This may be considered a byproduct of the original 気 , meaning of 'attention', referring to the way that the speaker 'senses (A)', regardless of what is actually true for (A) on the inside."

When making assumptions, ことだから will often be seen following verbs in their dictionary forms, or nouns followed by の. Alternatively, ことだから may appear following verbs in any of their standard forms when the situation of (A) is considered as a good opportunity to also do (B), according to the speaker. Lastly, ことだから may simply imply (strongly) that (A) is the reason for (B). In these cases, either verbs in their standard forms or nouns followed by の may precede ことだから . Despite having these three slightly different nuances, the speaker's intended meaning will usually be clear in the (B) part of the sentence.

The first contrastive use of ことなく illustrates that (A) is something negative, to which (B) should be done as a preventative measure, or was able to be done while avoiding (A). The second use of ことなく highlights when (A) is something that was or would be wished for, but unfortunately (B) happened without it being realized.

This expression can be translated as 'to become (A)', but has the nuance that someone/thing caused (A) to become that way. Due to this, it may also be translated as 'it has been decided that (A)', or 'it will end up being (A)'. ことになる is primarily used with verbs and い-Adjectives in their attributive form . It may also be used with な-Adjectives followed by な. The 'it has been decided that (A)' meaning only applies to verbs, as only verbs will be enacted by someone/thing. Fun Fact This structure is a good example of why なる is often viewed as the intransitive form of する . する conveys that someone is performing an action (transitive), while なる implies that something is the result of an action (intransitive). This is why the (A)  phrase in ことになる is usually determined to have been decided/performed by someone else, while still focusing on exactly 'what' (A) became."

In English, this is usually interpreted as '(A) is true, but (B), or 'although (A), (B)'. When this grammar structure is used, the same word will be repeated before both ことは and が (or けど). Due to this, the literal translation is similar to 'that which is (A) is (A), but (B)'. This simply emphasizes that the speaker recognizes (A) as being true, but would like to express information that is contrary to that. ことは～が can appear with any type of word, but だ will need to be used following nouns before が, while な, である, だった or ではない tends to follow な-Adjectives. In most cases, ことは～が expresses that the base fact of (A) is true, but the speaker has some sort of opinion or impression that is in opposition to that fact."

However, ござる is regularly used in dramas, manga, and other forms of media (especially historical dramas). Fun Fact 御座 る literally means 'to be', and it does not matter whether the object that is being described is animate (would usually use いる), or inanimate (would usually use ある). However, いらっしゃる 'to be' is preferred when referring to other people, as honorific language is more respectful than polite speech . Due to this, ございます will often be used in reference to people, in place of であります (the polite form of である ). Notice that で is used in these examples. でございます itself is considered its own grammatical structure, that we will examine in a separate grammar point."

It is often translated as 'even'. さえ has three primary meanings, which are as follows: Analogical Reasoning: 類推 - Analogy, (A) is an outstanding example of something. Limit: 限定 - Limit, (A) is all that is needed for something. Addition: 添加 - (A) compounds something that is pre-existing. さえ is regularly paired with other particles and is often followed by verbs in negative form, with the overall meaning usually being determined by what part (B) of the sentence is conveying. Let's look at a few examples. In each of these cases, we can see how さえ is showing that (A) is an extreme example of something. Fun Fact は, も, でも, and さえ are all adverbial particles that can be thought of as having a relationship toward, and away from what is 'expected' in any given situation. This relationship can be seen here: (A) は - (A) is completely expected, there is nothing unusual. (A) も - (A) will be included as part of what is expected, but can be unusual. (A) でも - (A) may or may not be included as part of what is expected, and can be unusual. (A) さえ - (A) is separated completely from what is expected, and is unusual. Due to this unexpected and unusual situation that さえ always presents, it is regularly translated as 'let alone (A)', or 'not to mention (A)'."

This use is an extension of the base meaning that the kanji 更 has in indicating that something is 'approaching change'. Because of this, the expression used following 更 に will always be something that is either further along than the initial statement either in regard to time, quantity, or volume. Taking this into consideration, 'in addition to (A)' may also be used as a fairly standard translation. As さらに is used adverbially, it often appears at the beginning of part (B) of a sentence, after the 'base' information has already been indicated. Fun-fact The meaning of 更 as 'approaching change' merely indicates that something has already reached 'fullness', and anything more than that will cause a fundamental change in the state of (A). Due to this, さらに primarily indicates things where (A) is considered 'complete' or 'enough' in and of itself, and what happens in (B) pushes that thing beyond a certain threshold. This may be either positive or negative depending on the sentence."

When this happens, it transforms the target adjective into a noun that illustrates the 'amount' of that particular adjective. This commonly translates as '-ness' in English (sweetness, tallness, spiciness, etc), but is referred to as degree in Japanese. Fun Fact It is thought that this suffix originally stemmed from the kanji 差 (meaning 'distinction'), and was used for highlighting things that were distinctive features of something. In this way, さ is also sometimes used after the dictionary form of verbs, to highlight a distinct point in time that something happens. However, this use of the suffix is far less common in modern Japanese, and is known as ' poetic language '. It was primarily used during Japan's 'middle ages', which spanned from (around) 1100, until close to the end of the 1500's."

This structure may be translated as 'to have no choice but (A)', or 'there is only (A)'. しかない regularly emphasizes the point that nothing apart from (A) is possible. To use しかない , simply attach it directly to the non-past form of whichever verb you would like to highlight as being the 'only' possible action. Unlike だけ, which implies that one particular option was chosen (out of several), しか always insinuates that (A) is the only option, and therefore will sound much stronger than だけ. Also, as only one option exists, it will often be assumed by the listener that some particular circumstances resulted in (A) being all that can be done. Fun Fact Occasionally, しかない may be used in manga, anime, or other forms of media that use casual language. In these cases, it is not uncommon to see しか abbreviated to っきゃ, resulting in っきゃない. However, this is not a common abbreviation in daily language."

However, the last し may be replaced with から or ので , before the 'result' is stated. Using し will indicate that each 'reason' being listed is of equal weight/importance.

The other primary verb being 来 る . する means to do something, or to make something a certain way. する will almost always have the particle を attached to the thing that is being done (depending on the form of the verb). The reason that する verbs are called さ-column irregular conjugation verbs in Japanese is because the る in する does not conjugate, but is dropped. This will leave す to be the part that conjugates. Because of this, する has qualities of both る-Verbs (the る being dropped), and う-Verbs (the remaining す changing, depending on the conjugation). Here are some examples of how する changes. （さ）せる , （し）ます , （す）る , （せ）よ . We will learn more about each of these conjugations of する , and their individual meanings at a later stage. For now, let's take a look at the polite します conjugation. In a broader sense, する can be thought of as meaning 'to do something that has an external effect'."

This is a formal expression that literally means ‘I cannot leave it as it is with (A) undone’, and therefore indicates strong will to complete the action that is reflected in the standard translations.

Caution Due to this grammar expression showing strong will to not give up until (A) is done, it will often be used with causative verbs in (A).

Because of this, common translations of せい are 'fault', 'due to', or 'because of'. As せい is a noun, it may be used after the attributive form of any other word. The case marking particle で will also regularly be seen after せい, especially when conveying the (B) result that occurred 'with' or 'by means of' those 'doings'. Fun Fact The 'doings' that 所為 represents is similar to the negative 'doings' that is used in English to place blame. This can be seen in phrases such as 'it was the weather's doings', or 'ah, so the missing cookies were your doings!'"

Occasionally, そうにもない may also appear, and has the strongest nuance of being unlikely to happen amongst そうにない , そうもない , and そうにもない . Note that the only difference between these three structures is the addition, subtraction, or combination of the に and も particles.

To use this structure, attach たい to the ます stem form of any verb, then replace the い in たい with がる . Caution たがる is in contrast to てほしい which means 'to want someone to do (A)'. These differences will need to be practiced, and memorized. This is also in contrast to the い-Adjective 欲 しい 'to want (A)'. To describe that someone seems like they want something (rather than that they want to 'do' something), がる will be paired with this adjective."

The primary nuance with たちまち compared to other similar structures is that たちまち indicates that something happened spontaneously, and was not able to be controlled. In many cases, たちまち will indicate something entering a new, ongoing state, or something being completed. たちまち will often appear directly before the verb phrase that it is describing as being the new state. Fun-fact たちまち originally comes from the kanji structure 忽 ち , with the kanji itself meaning 'without thought'. This nuance is kept with たちまち , as all actions associated with the word indicate a lack of planning or thought before happening. Despite this, the kanji itself is rarely used in modern writing."

This expression is quite direct, and can imply that there may be some sort of negative consequence if (A) is not done. In that respect, this phrase could also be translated as 'It would be better if you did (A)'. たほうがいい may also be used with the base (dictionary) form of a verb, but will sound more like a general opinion in those cases, rather than giving advice.

However, it is classified as a non-independent word in Japanese, and must always be connected to another word which illustrates the 'sake' that ため is highlighting. The case marking particle に will often be added after ため , to show that (A) is a goal that something will be done to reach. Due to this, ために can be translated as 'for the sake of (A)', or 'in order to (A)'. To use ために , attach it to the end of verb in its non-past form, or a noun follow by の. Fun Fact Despite mainly being used to highlight goals, or things dictating an action, ため is also sometimes used to highlight events that have already taken place, and their results. Due to this, a more accurate translation of ため (in all of its uses) is 'in light of (A)'. This simply highlights that (A) is the primary or major event/thing that resulted in (B), or will result in (B). When ため highlights past events, it is often translated simply as 'due to', or 'because of'."

(B) will always be something negative that is thought to inevitably occur once the action of (A) happens. These expressions may be translated as 'once (A), (B)', 'now that (A), (B)', or 'as soon as (A), (B)'. Both たら and が are being used as conjunction particles . たら carries its usual meaning of 'if' or 'when', while が has the meaning of 'however', or 'but'. This means that たが 最後 means '(A), but it will end up as (B)', while たら 最後 means 'when (A), in will end up as (B)'. Although this nuance is slightly different, they are used completely interchangeably. Because 最後 is primarily seen before the comma in these types of sentences, it can be easy to think that it is connected to the が or たら. However, it is actually more correctly connected logically to the (B) half of the sentence, and states that the 'final state' will end up being that way. Caution Occasionally, the (B) phrase will be omitted from these sentences when the negative result is obvious."

Due to this, たる will not be used when simply stating that '(B) is (A)'.

This expression is often used in cases where the overall situation is negative, but it is still better than the alternative. This structure is a combination of the particle だけ 'only', and the な-Adjective 増 し, meaning 'better', or 'preferable'. Originally, まし is just the conjunctive form of 増 す, an う-Verb meaning to grow or increase (like 増 える). Due to this, the literal meaning is 'even just (A) is a plus, compared to what could have occured'. だけましだ will be used primarily after verbs, い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives followed by な. In the vast majority of cases, まし will simply be written in hiragana, or even katakana as マシ. The katakana version often further emphasizes that one should be grateful for (A). Caution - Although not as common, だけまだましだ may also be seen. As can be seen by the addition of まだ 'still', this form merely emphasized the point even further."

Caution だ should never be attached to the end of い-Adjectives . In these cases, it is considered more correct to attach a polite equivalent, like です .

This structure is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the conjunction particle たら 'when', or 'if', and the い-Adjective ない. It may be used in either positive or negative contexts. といったらない , or the shortened form ったらない may appear after adjectives or nouns in their standard form s. The ない in this grammar pattern is commonly thought to be an abbreviation of ありはしない, or ありゃしない, the conjunctive form of the う-Verb ある combined with the case marking particle は, and the negated form of する, しない. In this way, a more literal meaning can be thought of as 'if one were to say (A), it's not possible'. Caution As this expression highlights an extreme amount, い-Adjectives will often be used with the さ suffix added, specifically to indicate amount."

This use is called 引用 in Japanese, which basically translates to 'reference', or 'citation'. って is almost exclusively used after direct quotations, and will be followed by a verb indicating what type of communication was used. 言 った, 思 った, 聞 いた, for example. Just like with と , the verb that comes after って is frequently omitted. This is even more true for って , as many things are omitted in casual language. Caution Although often heard, due to って being very casual, it can be considered unnatural to use in sentences that also use the です or ます polite structures. However, if the conversation is formal but friendly (like between a senpai and a kouhai), most people would consider it normal."

Fun Fact Although 'accidentally' is the most common meaning of つい , it actually may be used to convey three different nuances. These are as follows: はからず - Something that is uncalculated. 思 わず - Something that is not thought about. 距離 が わずかなさま - A small gap/interval. In each of these meanings, つい keeps a sense of time being the most important factor. Due to this, つい will give the impression that whatever resulted in the 'accidental' action, will be something that happened momentarily. This is very close to the meaning of 'lapse' in English. 'a lapse in time', 'a lapse in judgment', 'a lapse in forethought'."

Additionally, it is also quite common to see the same verb being repeated in both places. When this happens, the (A) verb will be in the standard form , while the (B) verb will be in the passive form. This just translates as 'to do (A) and to have (A) done to oneself'. Caution This grammar pattern is only used with a limited set of words in modern Japanese. Here is a list of some standard combinations. 行 きつ 戻 りつ - To go back and forth. 浮 きつ 沈 みつ - To surface and submerge (to bob). 見 えつ 隠 れつ - To go in and our of sight. とつおいつ (from 取 りつ 置 きつ) - To waver between. 矯 めつ 眇 めつ - To take a good look. 組 んず 解 れつ - To intertwine and release (to grapple). 抜 きつ 抜 かれつ - To pull away and be pulled away from (to be neck and neck). 持 ちつ 持 たれつ - To have and to be held (to give and take). 押 しつ 押 されつ - To press and be pressed. 追 いつ 追 われつ - To overtake and be overtaken. 差 しつ 差 されつ - To pour and be poured (to take turns exchanging drinks)."

Generally, it is translated in a similar way as てもらえませんか 'won't you (A)', or 'could you please (A)'. This construction and いただく itself can regularly be seen as 頂 く, its kanji form. Due to this kanji literally meaning 'to be topped with', it is just acknowledging that the person that is doing the action for you (or someone in your group), is doing so from 'above' (sounds more respectful). Here we can see how the 'to be topped/capped with' meaning is used in a standard sentence."

In this way, ておく can be thought of as meaning 'to do (A) and leave it (until later)'. When using ておく , the 'future event' that the (A) action is being done for may be something that is coming soon, or may be something that the speaker doesn't want to ever come. Due to this, ておく is also regularly used when the speaker is doing something specifically to prevent another thing from happening. Caution ておく is sometimes contracted to とく (or どく in verbs where て would usually be said as で ). Although this is not excessively common in conversation, it is very common in drama, manga, and similar media."

It is usually translated as 'please try to (A)', where (A) is the verb that ご 覧 is connected to, through the use of the conjunction particle て. However, despite being translated as 'please try to (A)', the literal meaning of 覧 is 'to look', or 'to peruse' (to look at one's own leisure, without needing to rush). Due to this, てごらん can be thought of as being quite similar to てみる 'to try', but with the added emphasis of 'try as you like, when it suits you'. Caution As ご 覧 is honorific language , it cannot be used to refer to your own actions, or things that you will 'try'. It will only ever be used to make suggestions to other people about what they should try. Caution Sometimes ごらん and なさい will be paired together. This slightly increases the strength of the suggestion, and may be perceived as a very light command. Because of this, ごらんなさい is primarily used by superiors/elders, when requesting that a subordinate/younger person try something."

This structure is almost exclusively seen with verbs, but may occasionally be seen with い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns as well. The verb that てはいられない is connected to is often considered to be something that cannot continue on due to either some time-based or feeling-based limitation. In this way, it regularly has the nuance of '(A) cannot continue due to (B)', with the reason of (B) mentioned in another part of the sentence. When appearing with い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns, the nuance will change slightly, and simply reflects the meaning of いられない itself in conveying that (A) 'cannot be', or is 'impossible' in some way. As always, ては will be replaced by では in the case of nouns and な-Adjectives."

This grammar pattern may also be used for highlighting negative sentences, and will translate similarly to 'even if not (A)', or 'even though not (A)' in these cases. Fun Fact でも (the form after nouns and な-Adjectives ) is often considered to be an adverbial particle itself, and there is often debate amongst native speakers as to whether でも is actually a word, or simply a standard grouping of で , the case marking particle and も , the adverbial particle .

Both structures are usually translated as 'even if (A), (B)', or 'no matter if (A), (B)'. Despite this, the more literal meaning of each is closer to 'so it's (A), (B) still won't be affected'. This just emphasizes the fact that (A) is of no relation to the result, like saying 'so what if it is' in English. When used consecutively, であれ shows that regardless of whether something is (A) or (B), the result of (C), will not change. Both であれ and であろうと will primarily attach to nouns in sentences that express some kind of question or assumption through words like どんな or たとえ. Caution Although ～であれ～であれ implies 'no matter whether it is (A) or (B)', both (A) and (B) in these types of sentences usually fall under the same category, as (C) needs to be something that links them logically. For example (A) may be 'a plane', and (B) may be 'a submarine', while (C) will be describing something about them both being vehicles."

(A) is often some special circumstance or condition that leads to the conclusion or assumption of (B), were (A) to be accurate. As this expression is emphatic, (B) will usually indicate something that must be done, or can't be avoided with structures like しかない, なければならない, ざるを得ない, etc. Fun Fact とあれば tends to appear with のため before it quite often.

                        "content": "One of the ways to perform nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun) in Japanese is through the use of the expression ということ . This grammar point is a combination of と (the particle), 言 う (the verb), and こと (the noun). Together, the literal translation is close to 'that (A) is said to be'. However, in reality, it sounds far less formal than this. To use ということ , attach it to the end of any phrase (without です , or ます). In most cases it will be written using hiragana. In conversation, という is regularly shortened to simply って . This form will be heard/seen much more frequently in conversation/manga and similar things. ということ is also frequently used when clarifying what someone else has said. In these cases, it translates very similarly to 'you mean that (A)?', or 'you mean to say that (A)?' Caution Although the kanji 言 う and 事 may be used in this expression, the most common form does not use any kanji at all. This is a regular occurance in Japanese, as many set grammatical structures will not use kanji, simply because it makes the pattern easier to identify."

The noun 点 'point' can be thought of as directly indicating the aspect of (A) that is being focused on. Literally, the meaning is 'if considered from the aspect of (A), (B)'.

Fun-fact Although a combination of the quotation particle と and the う-Verb 言 う 'to say', という is mostly written in hiragana and considered to be a set phrase which simply indicates that the contents of the phrase preceding it requires explaining in some way."

Coming from the kanji 到頭 , this structure literally means 到 (to arrive at), 頭 (the head of/crux of) something. Due to this, 'finally', and 'after all' are the two most common translations of とうとう . Like many other adverbs in Japanese, とうとう is often used at the beginning of a phrase/sentence. While とうとう is written in hiragana the majority of the time, knowing the kanji will help when trying to remember the expression's nuance. That nuance is that something has 'ended', usually after some sort of long journey/effort. This adverb may be used to express either positive or negative outcomes, as it focuses more on the time required to achieve the result, rather than the result being good or bad. Caution とうとう is not used in situations where you expect something to happen/start, but there has not actually been a period of time in which some sort of effort was made to achieve a result. A good example of this is the changing of seasons. You might want to say 'finally, it's summer!', but this is not something that anyone has done anything to achieve. Rather, it came naturally. In these cases, いよいよ will be used, and has the nuance of 'finally', or 'at last' (in relation to something starting/happening)."

As the name suggests, these particles are used for listing groups of items that share similarities. とか can be used after verbs, or nouns, to express 'among other things, (A)'. When multiple things are listed, the last item in the list can (and often does) have とか omitted. Caution とか is used to list items in a non-exhaustive way. What this means is that the listener will assume that there are other items in the list, apart from what is stated directly. The speaker is just providing a few examples of a (potentially much larger) category. Fun Fact As we have seen, とか may be used with verb phrases. This is in contrast to や , a similar grammar point that can only be used for listing nouns."

This is not to be confused with the alternative translation of ときたら which is ‘that damned (A)’ when used for criticism. ときたら will attach to the end of a phrase marking what the conversation is ‘concerning’, before that topic will then be explained further. In other words, (A) will present the topic, while (B) will indicate the speaker’s first instinctive thoughts about that topic. For the speaker, (A) is usually something that strongly makes them think of (B). However, it may just be that the relationship between (A) and (B) is a thing that the speaker is implying as obvious, or that goes without saying.

Conceptually, it is similar to にする , which means 'to decide on (A)'. However, due to する being in the passive form in this construction, it is closer to 'to be decided on', and expresses the general opinions/thoughts of large groups of people. The と in this expression is a case marking particle , and expresses the result nuance of this particle. Caution The main difference between と as a case marking particle and と as a conjunction particle is that the case-marking particle will always link a single word/phrase to one specific word/result. The conjunction particle on the other hand, will often be followed by a 読点 (Japanese comma), as it is separating two distinct thoughts within the sentence, rather than just a simple 'result'."

Despite being a combination of several individual parts, として is often considered to be a 副助詞 (adverbial particle) by itself, meaning that it will most often be seen connected directly to nouns. As として works in the same way as a 副助詞 , it may be connected directly to a second noun to express that (B) is something functioning as (A). Fun Fact This result use of と regularly appears when one particular aspect of something is being highlighted (while other aspects still exist). This simply means that nothing apart from (A) is being considered when expressing (B)."

It will be translated as 'unconsciously (A) when (B)', or 'without paying attention to (A), (B)'. This pattern is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the adverbial particle も, and the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective ない. It will be seen after the dictionary form of verbs, and can be thought of as literally meaning something similar to 'even while not intending to (B), while (A), (B)'. ともなしに is similar, but pairs the noun なし 'without' with に, instead of using the conjugative form of ない. ともなく and ともなしに will often be seen in sentences that use たら. This puts emphasis on the specific time that something happened while performing another action absentmindedly. Despite translating this way, the action that precedes ともなく itself will be intentional, but the thing that comes about as a result of performing that action will not be what the doer was aiming to achieve."

The whole structure itself is usually interpreted simply as 'it is meaningless to (A)', 'there's nothing one can do about (A)', or nothing will come of (A)'. どうにも will primarily be seen either at the start or end of sentences, after or before going on to explain a situation which seems impossible due to some specific reason. This grammar pattern emphasizes the speaker's feelings of resignation, frustration, or regret in relation to something that is out of their control. Due to this, it often highlights the actions of someone other than the speaker. Occasionally, どうにも is further emphasized by the addition of こうにも."

(B) is most frequently いけない 'cannot go', which makes ないといけない a double negative phrase, which translates to 'must do (A)', or 'have to do (A)'. いけない may be replaced with だめ, to make the phrase more casual, but ならない is generally not used with ないと . ないといけない is regularly abbreviated to ないと , but has exactly the same meaning in these cases. Caution As と has the 'and' nuance, it gives ないと a level of strength that is not seen in similar phrases like なければいけない , or なくてはいけない . Because of this, ないと is often used to highlight things which absolutely 'must' be done (obeying the law, adhering to customs, using common sense, etc.)."

To use なかなか (or 中々 in its kanji form), なかなか will be put at the beginning of a phrase (or directly before the negative verb), before further describing the situation.

However, this is where the similarities end. なくてはいけない is an example of a double negative in Japanese, and actually has the meaning '(A) must be done', or 'must do (A)'. While this grammar point is usually translated as 'must do', the literal translation is 'must not, not do (A)'. This double 'not' is where many learners have difficulties. いけない simply means 'cannot go', and comes from the negative potential form of 行 く. To use this structure, simply create the negative form of a verb, and then convert ない to なく (the conjunctive form of an い-Adjective ), followed by て . After this, は is added, and then finally いけない . いけない is considered to be the most common structure used with the 'must', and 'must not' grammar points, and is natural in both speech, and written Japanese. Alternatively, ならない may be used in formal speech, but is much better suited to writing. だめ is also acceptable, but much more casual than either いけない or ならない . Caution The ては in なくては is often converted to ちゃ, as this is easier to say. なくちゃ may then be followed by いけない , or いけない may be omitted, without changing the meaning. These casual structures are very similar to words like 'gotta' in English."

This results in the same 'and' meaning as the standard て form, but with the negative meaning of ない. なくて is often used when the phrase that comes before it is being highlighted as an example/reason for a specific result. In these situations, the translation is usually 'because not (A), (B)', or 'because I didn't (A), (B)'. When なくて is used in this way, it is often followed by the speaker's feelings (in the form of an adjective), verbs in the potential form, or something that is generally beyond the control of the speaker. It is due to this fact that the result is 'beyond control' that the translation becomes 'because'. Some examples of words that express things beyond the control of the speaker are 困 る (to be troubled), 嬉 しい (to be happy), 疲 れている (to feel weary), 心配 (to feel anxiety/worry), 安心 (to feel relief)."

Due to this, なさい is most frequently used toward peers, or people of lower status, like children. To use なさい , simply connect it to the ます stem of any verb. なさい may be shortened further to な, which becomes an even more casual form that is used most frequently toward peers. Caution Be careful not to get confused between な (the particle), and な (the shortened form of なさい ). These can seem very similar, but な (meaning don't) will always be used with the dictionary form of a verb, while な (meaning please do) will always be used with the ます stem of a verb."

In this way, it is regularly translated as 'such as', 'things like', or 'and so on'. など may be used after nouns, to describe that (A) is being presented as an example from within a group. Alternatively, など can be followed by の (B), to show that (A) is only one type of thing from the broader category, (B). など is regularly seen in its kanji form, 等 . This kanji itself has a similar meaning to 'etc' in English. Fun Fact The kanji for 等 is also used in the pluralizing suffix, ら . Due to this, we can see that this kanji is regularly utilized to highlight something that exists as part of a larger group. In the first sentence, など presents (A) as being part of a larger group of similar things. This is exactly the same thing that happens in the second sentence with ら . Fun Fact など is also sometimes written as なんか , and has an interchangeable meaning in many situations. However, なんか will never use the kanji form of 等 ."

It is often translated as ‘I don’t know about (A), but (B)’, or ‘maybe (A), but (B). This phrase is formal, and usually used to emphasize that, regardless of (A), (B) fits a specific description. ならいざ 知 らず will follow verbs in their standard forms . Additionally, it may follow either な-Adjectives or nouns that have had their terminal だ replaced with なら. Just like the literal translation of ‘if it’s (A), well then I don’t know’, this structure emphasizes that (A) may or may not be the case, but (B) is definite. However, there is no direct use of ‘but’ in Japanese. This shows that the ‘but’ comes from the simple contrast of (A) being unknown while (B) is known. ならいざ 知 らず may also be seen following other structures such as い-Adjectives when they have been nominalized with の. This の pattern is also used with verbs, but it is less common than simply attaching ならいざしらず to one of the standard verb forms. Fun Fact In many cases, (A) is an extreme example used to show that (B) is the opposite of that, and is therefore either surprising or irritating. Caution Occasionally は will be used instead of なら. However, the meaning of the overall phrase will remain the same."

This use can be translated as 'for (A) do to (C) in the way of (B)'. Or more simply, 'to do its best in its own way', or 'to do as much as one can'.

Either of the case marking particle s に or の will come after なり, depending on whether なり is linked directly to a noun, or is being used adverbially. なりに and なりの may follow almost any word in its plain form , with the word it follows being the group or quality that is being represented. This use of なり is considered a neologism, which is a pre-existing word that has been adapted to have a new meaning or nuance. When used this way, なり will almost always express that (A) is not doing something adequately or as desired, but is doing the best it can based on the 'pattern' or 'mold' that it comes from."

Literally, the meaning is much closer to 'what + counter + I wonder?', as it shows the speaker's uncertainty about the number. In addition to なん; いく, from the kanji 幾 (how many/much) may be used as part of this construction. While both are fairly common, 幾 is more common as part of set expressions, like 幾 ら (how much) and 幾 つ (how many/old), while なん is more common for counting specific things, like people. Both 何 and 幾 are regularly seen in plain hiragana and their kanji forms, so it is worth remembering both. Caution Despite having the same kanji as 何 , なん will almost always be used to count things, while なに will be used to identify things."

It is a combination of the case marking particle に, and the ている continuous form of 懸 かる 'to depend'. Although にかかっている may attach to nouns, it is also frequently seen following set structures such as かどうか 'whether or not', and か 否 か 'yes or no'. The に in にかかっている may sometimes be replaced with the adverb 如何 に 'how', 'in what way', or 'to what extent. In these situations, the meaning stays relatively the same, but will extend to 'depending on the way in which (A)', or 'depending on to what extent (A)'. Fun Fact 懸 かる is from the same family of verbs as 掛 かる, 架 かる, and 罹 る. These all have a similar meaning, but with a slightly different nuance. Japanese has many verbs like this that have the same reading, but with a nuance that changes based on the kanji. Due to kanji not always being used for many of these, it will be important to be able to recognize which nuance is being used in any given situation."

                        "content": "Coming from the る - Verb 掛 ける 'to suspend', にかけて conveys that something is happening 'over a period of time', 'from (A) until (B)', or 'all through (A)'. This grammar structure is a combination of the case marking particle に , and 掛 ける combined with the conjunction particle て. Literally, the meaning can be thought of as follows: に - Marks (A) as the location/state. 掛 けて - States that something is 'suspended' (in an ongoing process) in that location/state. The 'something' that is an ongoing process will usually be indicated by a (B) part of the sentence. This expression will primarily be used with nouns. にかけて is primarily used in written language, although it appears quite often in the news as well, indicating that some weather pattern is expected to continue for a set period of time. Caution Occasionally, the adverbial particle は is used after にかけて. This transforms the meaning of 'all through (A)', to something similar to 'limited to within (A)'. Any (B) phrase in these types of sentences will be contrasting (B) with (A), rather than saying (B) is occurring within (A). As we can see by these examples, this is an extension of the standard use of は, which shows that everything before it is a 'set state'. Therefore '(A) は (B)', means that 'only (A) defines (A), (B) is a separate entity/discussion'."

Caution Like with 幸 いにして and 不幸 にして , にして tends to be used with a fairly limited set of words when having the meaning of 'both (A) and (B)'. Due to this, it is best to only use patterns that you have come across before. Fun Fact The tense at the end of にして sentences often changes the way that it will be understood, but it is important to remember that all にして structures simply put emphasis on (A) as being what allowed (B), led to (B), or exists in precedence to (B)."

Just like the にする grammar point that is used for highlighting decisions, this にする construction implies that the speaker has a high level of control over the action. Basically, this changes the adjective into an adverb, and then uses する to show that the adjective itself is the thing that is being done. Fun Fact にする is one of four regularly repeating grammar patterns in Japanese that highlight the level of control that the speaker has over the action/result of an action. From highest to lowest level of control, these are as follows: にする - High level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action themselves. になる - High level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action themselves, but there is no external target. とする - Medium level of control, the speaker/subject can perform this action, but some outside factors may need to be considered (difficulty, other people, time, etc.). となる - Low level of control, the speaker/subject has almost no control over these actions, and something that came about purely due to external factors is being discussed."

This meaning is usually in regard to assuming a new position, such as a new job. However, the particular meaning conveyed here will be closer to 'due to (A), (B)', 'on account of (A), (B)', or 'for each (A), (B)'. につき will follow nouns directly, before the (B) part of the sentence describes what is happening 'due to' or 'on account of (A)'. This grammar point is quite formal, so it is often seen in formal documents, announcements, and notifications. Regardless of the several common English translations, the base meaning of 'to affix to (A)' is kept in all of the uses of につき , as it simply implies that (B) is in answer to, exists in a way that is directly linked to, suitable for, or caused by (A)."

This is a combination of the case marking particle に, the う - Verb, 基 づく 'to originate from', and the conjunction particle て. This expression regularly highlights some kind of judgement/conclusion that the speaker has made, using (A) as their base. To use に 基 づいて , put the noun (or noun phrase) that you would like to identify as a 'basis' before に 基 づいて , and then express your judgment/conclusion in part (B) of the sentence. Alternatively, the past form of 基 づく may be used when connected directly to a second noun. (A) に 基 づいた (B) directly expresses that (B) is based on (A). Fun Fact The kanji 基 is fairly accurately translated as 'foundation', and is regularly used to highlight things that 'stem' from something. Due to this, に 基 づいて may also be used to identify things that are 'produced from (A)', 'created from (A)', or 'invented based on (A)'."

This 'went to' implies the 'attempt' or 'will' on behalf of the speaker. Caution As opposed to the similar に～ない grammar point that pairs with verbs in dictionary form , ようにも～ない tends to refer more to physical reasons for why something cannot be done. に～ない on the other hand is often used to illustrate mental limitations."

Both the kanji form and the plain hiragana form are quite common, so it will be helpful to remember both. As (A) is generally considered to be something that has some kind of foundation.

This expression regularly appears after names/pronouns, but may also be used with regular nouns. にとって is often translated as 'to (A)', 'for (A)', or 'concerning (A)'. However, it is used in almost exactly the same way as から 見 て 'from the perspective of (A)'. To use にとって, simply attach it to the end of a noun (or noun phrase) that you would like to express a certain viewpoint, judgment, or opinion from. Fun Fact にとって comes from the verb 取 る 'to take'. In this way, it literally means 'to take up (A)', where (A) is the location (standpoint) being highlighted with the case marking particle に. Broadly, にとって has two main uses, these are as follows: の 身 として - From (A)'s standpoint. (When used about people) の 立場 から 見 て - When looking at it from (A). (When used about things)"

Although this feeling of 'opposition' may be negative, in most circumstances, it just means 'toward' in the sense of targeting something. に 対 する will be followed directly by a second noun, while に 対 して creates a pause in the sentence, before (B) will be explained in the second half of that sentence. Fun Fact Compared to に 関 して (another structure used to show how things 'relate' to each other), に 対 して focuses on (A) and (B) equally, explaining how those things interact, compare, or contrast each other. Caution As に 対 して strongly contrasts (A) and (B), this grammar structure will often be used to express differences between two things. This is very similar to 'whereas' in English."

These translations are usually 'in', 'at', 'to', 'for', or 'on'. Let's look at an example of each meaning. While these examples may seem quite confusing at first, it will be easier to think of に as always having one 'basic' meaning. That meaning is to be the 'end-point' of an action. This means that whatever action is being described, can only be considered complete/able to be completed once you're at/while you're at the location/time described in the sentence. Verbs like 住 む (to live/dwell) often confuse learners, as they use に instead of で . This is also due to the fact that 住 む is a verb that can only be 'completed' at the destination. (You can only complete the act of living/dwelling in the place that you live, so to speak)."

This particular expression is used with the plain (dictionary) form of verbs only. In these examples, we can see that there is no difference between Ichidan verbs and Godan   verbs. Both will appear in their plain form. In this expression, のが is performing the same function as in the regular のは・のが construction. This function is nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun). However, のは cannot be used with this phrase, as が is always required with adjectives. Caution If you want to express that you were good at something (in the past), the verb will still remain in the plain form, but 上手 will change to the past tense. Caution This grammar point can sound a little bit arrogant if you are referring to your own skills, so the word 得意 may also be used if you want to sound a bit more humble."

Common translations include 'I think it's (A), isn't it?', and 'it might be that (A)'. However, being that this is just a combination of の, ではない 'isn't', だろう 'probably', and か, the literal meaning is simply 'is it probably not that it's (A)'. Just like in English, the elongation of the phrase and not saying anything with certainty makes it sound more modest. のではないだろうか may be seen following verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns when preceded with な. Additionally, でしょう may replace だろう. This phrase can also be used when seeking agreement from the listener, or when mildly trying to persuade them that your way of thinking may be correct."

This construction will be seen following verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns that are followed by な. As can be seen in several of the above examples, も may replace は, with only a slight change in nuance (も will place extra emphasis on the obviousness of the remark, according to the speaker). Compared to て 当然 だ , のは 当然 だ is slightly stronger, and separates the previous statement from what the speaker considers 'natural'. This is equivalent to the difference between 'being happy is natural' (slightly weaker), and 'it's natural that one would be happy' (slightly stronger) in English."

In the first sentence, we can see that の is showing ownership, however in the second sentence, it is simply showing a relationship between (A) and (B). の is also often used in the same way as が , to highlight the subject of a statement. Our lesson for が will be covered separately. Both of these examples are slightly advanced and use adjectives, but don't worry, we will be covering them next! Caution の is usually used after nouns, but can also be used after other types of words, specifically when it is transforming them into a noun-like phrase. This is called nominalization in English.

After this, the (B) part of the sentence will describe some other factor that is worth mentioning. はもちろん will be used directly after noun (A), before the sentence will go on to discuss noun (B). This construction can be translated as 'not only (A), but (B)', 'not to mention (A), (B)', and other similar English expressions. In many cases, despite (A) being the obvious factor, (B) is being highlighted as sharing similar qualities to (A). This means that in はもちろん sentences, も will almost always be seen after (B).

However, が primarily marks single actions or statements. We will explore this distinction in more detail when covering が . In many sentences (especially short ones), either は or が would be considered perfectly natural. This depends on whether someone is simply stating something ( は ), or highlighting it especially ( が ). In the first sentence, は broadly describes what the sentence is about (curry). In the second sentence, は again describes the whole sentence being about 'me', but が highlights one specific piece of information (wine being the thing that is hated). Caution は cannot be used to describe things that you are seeing or experiencing 'in the moment' (right now). This is due to 'in the moment' events being considered part of a larger experience (your whole day for example). Caution は has 2 main functions. The first marks the topic of the sentence, the second is used for contrast or making comparisons. Although there are no 'strict' rules for this, when は is used toward (or after) the middle of a sentence, it will usually have the nuance of contrast. In the second sentence, は will give the listener the impression that there is a comparison being made."

It is a る-Verb, and may be translated as '(A) looking', '(A) seeming', or 'behaving like (A)'. びる is quite formal, and will follow a limited set of expressions. びる will appear after nouns, or occasionally the stem form of い-Adjectives. びる indicates that, according to the speaker, something 'gives off the sense of (A)', and is based on visual information. As it is a descriptive verb, びる will change to びた when linked directly to a second noun. Fun Fact Both びる and めく can be thought of as similar to さ, the structure that pairs with adjectives to create new nouns indicating an extent. This is due to the fact that when びる or めく attach to a word, they turn that word itself into a verb that expresses 'having the feeling of (A)', or 'having gained the feeling of (A)' when used in past tense."

It implies some sort of moral obligation, or that (A) is the only reasonable course of action. This comes from the kanji 可 き, which carries the meaning of being something 'permissible' (indicating that any other action would not be acceptable). べき will be paired with the plain (non-past) form of a verb, before being followed by either だ , or another noun. べき is also sometimes translated as 'must do (A)', or 'should do (A)' but it is important to remember that it will always have the nuance of being the only 'permissible' choice, and is therefore very strong. Caution It is important to note that the verb appearing with べき cannot be in past tense, and you will need to use だった or でした after べき , if you would like to say that something 'ought to have been done' in the past. Fun Fact In modern Japanese, there are only 18 auxiliary verbs , of which べき is not one. べし (the standard form) is considered to be a classical auxiliary verb . Due to this, べき (and べし) are often referred to as classical auxiliary verbs . Fun Fact The combination of する and べき is a rare grammatical exception in Japanese, in which two forms are both considered equally correct. Due to this, either するべき, or すべき may be used."

Basically, 他 by itself just means 'another', or 'other'. に highlights 他 'another thing' as being the target of what comes next in any particular sentence. The possibilities are as follows: 他 に - Another thing. 他 に （ も ） - Even another thing (sounds less certain). 他 に （ は ） - Was there another thing (focuses on something pre-existing, which someone may have forgotten). 他 の + Noun - Another 'specific thing'. 他 に （ は ） may be used in either positive or negative sentences, but it tends to appear in negative sentences more often. Caution Because 他 に （ も ） focuses on the 'addition' of another thing, it cannot be used in negative sentences (with the exception of questions). The reason this is acceptable in questions, but not statements, is due to the 'isn't it?' meaning that negative questions can have in Japanese (just like English). It is the equivalent of the following: この 他 にも ない - In addition to this, there is also nothing (sounds strange in English!) その 他 にも ないか - In addition to that, is there nothing else?

Because よう (from the kanji 様 ) usually expresses the 'manner' in which something is existing/happening, this phrase literally highlights that something occurs 'in the manner of every (A)', and is therefore up to the interpretation of the listener as to whether the speaker means 'every', or 'almost every'. Caution Although みたいに and のように are regularly interchangeable, that is not the case with まい～のように . This is because みたいだ is originally an abbreviation of the more formal phrase を 見た ような , and therefore can sound unnatural when used to describe things that cannot be seen, like time."

In modern Japanese, まさか is thought of as a single adverb meaning 'it can't be true', 'no way', or 'don't tell me'. As it is treated primarily as an adverb, まさか will most often appear at the beginning of a sentence, before some statement about what the speaker is shocked/surprised about. Fun Fact まさ comes from 正 , meaning 'precise' or 'actual'. However, this noun is very rarely used in modern Japanese. まさに is an adverb used to mean 'precisely', while まさか is another adverb used to mean 'no way!'. However, the literal meaning of まさか is closer to 'is it true?', or 'is it actually?', due to か's role in creating questions."

The kanji 益 simply means 'gain'. Fun Fact Despite sometimes being seen as 益々 , this expression originally comes from the stacking of 増 す, an う - Verb meaning 'to increase'. Due to this, ますます is most often used to highlight verbs that indicate some sort of change, or with adjectives that can increase in intensity. Caution ますます is sometimes translated as 'less and less', but this situation is still actually considered as 'increasing' (increasingly negative)."

Although using まで as 'even' may seem different to 'until', they are essentially the same thing in Japanese. This is because まで always means '(A) まで , (B)', where (A) is the 'limitation/extent', and (B) is the 'noteworthy factor'. This 'noteworthy factor' will usually be a descriptive word/phrase, such as a verb, adjective, or explanation. Fun Fact The も particle is sometimes grouped together with まで , when the meaning is 'even'. This just adds emphasis to the fact that the event is somewhat surprising, or that the result is satisfying."

In each of these cases, it will carry the meaning of 'like (A)', or 'resembling (A)'. The difference between みたい describing a verb or a noun can be identified by whether it is followed by な (describes a noun), or に (describes a verb). Let's take a look at some examples. This difference is important to know, as (B), the thing that みたい is describing, does not always come directly after みたい . In the second example sentence, we can see that 泳 ぐ (the verb that に is linked to), does not actually come until later in the sentence. This is quite a regular occurrence, especially in longer passages. Caution Despite みたい meaning 'to resemble', and being based on (usually) visual stimulus, it should not be confused with 見 たい 'to want to see'. This is a common mistake that learners make, as みたい itself does not have a kanji form."

This is due to its meaning of 'to show signs of (A)', or 'to have the appearance of (A)'. It will be attached to nouns that the speaker experiences to be the case. As めく itself is a verb, it may appear in several different conjugation forms depending on how it is describing the rest of the sentence. When connected directly to a second noun, the past-tense form めいた is most common. This 'that the speaker experiences to be the case' part is important, as めく will almost always highlight the speaker's own personal feelings in regard to (A), and how they perceive it. The thing being described as (A) will usually not actually be (A), and the speaker is often aware of this fact. Caution めく is mostly used with set nouns, so it is best to only use it with expressions that you have already heard. Some examples are 謎 めく 'to appear to be a riddle', 皮肉 めく 'to appear to be sarcastic', 言 い 訳 めく 'to appear to be an excuse', 作 り 物 めく 'to appear to be fictitious', and seasons of the year."

This expression is a combination of the adverbial particle も, the pre-noun adjectival さる 'particular', or 'certain', the noun 事 'thing', and the conjunction particle ながら 'while'. Due to this, the more literal translation is simply 'while (A) is also of particular merit, (B)'. This literal translation will be helpful to remember, as もさることながら will always present (A) as important, but (B) as even more important than that. もさることながら will be attached to the end of nouns and noun phrases. As (B) is being emphasized in sentences that use this grammar structure, it is common to see other expressions of emphasis combined with もさることながら . Some examples include さらに 'additionally', なにより 'more than anything', and 以上 'above that'."

Due to もっとも offering clarification about something, the (B) phrase will often end with が, けど, けれども , and other similar expressions. When もっとも is used, the speaker is agreeing that (A) is true, but not the whole picture. As a noun itself, 尤 も can be described as 道理に 適 う, which means 'to stand to reason'. This nuance is kept, and may also be used as an accurate translation for もっとも as a conjunction."

This just means a noun that is used in a similar way to 'thing' in English. もの regularly refers to things that do not have their own name, or are difficult to name due to their complexity. When もの is combined with the auxiliary verb だ , it implies that the previously mentioned (A) is something that 'is what it is'. This is often used in relation to customs, conventions, common sense, or to highlight results that would naturally be expected in any given situation. To use ものだ, attach it to the end of the attributive form of any word/word that ends a phrase that you would like to highlight as being an obvious piece of information. ものだ as 'supposed to', or 'the way it is' can also be used to negate a phrase, and say that it is 'something that isn't expected', or 'shouldn't be the case'. To do this, だ will be replaced with ではない, or じゃない. Caution もの may sometimes be abbreviated as もん. This is far more common in spoken language, and can make the statement sound a bit more casual overall."

In the second sentence we can see that the recipient has been omitted, while in the third example, the giver was omitted. This is a regular occurrence when using もらう , as the receiver is usually obvious, or the 'giver' may not be important to the overall meaning of the sentence. In this example, the thing that was given is the focus, while the speaker does not consider the 'giver' something that needs to be mentioned.

This included things such as 'namely', 'immediately', 'in a moment', and others. All of these meanings simply hinted at the fact that the expression following やがて was already expected or known."

This may be interpreted as 'because of (A)', 'due to (A)', or 'the reason is (A)'. However, 'consequently to (A)', or 'as a consequence of (A)' are also completely acceptable translations that may help to differentiate ゆえに from less formal structures. As ゆえ itself is a noun, regular grammar rules such as being preceded by の will need to be followed if directly following another noun. In other cases, ゆえに will simply attach to the standard form of words. ゆえに may also appear at the beginning of new sentences. When this happens, it expresses 'as a result of (A)', where (A) is the entire previous sentence. The に will need to be replaced with の when ゆえ is being connected to another noun and therefore modifying it. Caution Just like 'as a consequence of' in English, ゆえに tends to be used far more frequently in regard to negative reasons than positive ones."

This is a combination of either of the auxiliary verbs う or よう, ではない, and the sentence-ending particle, か. う and よう primarily express will or intent like 'shall' in English. Due to the negation following them, the literal translation will be similar to 'shall we not do (A)?'. For ease of translation, this structure can be remembered as simply 'let's do (A)', or 'why don't we do (A)'. As with all structures that use う or よう, ようではないか will be attached to the end of a verb indicating the action which is being suggested. Alternatively, the abbreviated form of じゃない may be used in place of ではない. Despite this, ようではないか is primarily a formal grammar structure, so will most often use the unabbreviated version, or even more polite ようではありませんか construction. Fun-fact Occasionally, this grammar structure may be seen preceded by もらう. In these cases, it is usually challenging the listener to do something. This can be interpreted as 'why don't I have you do (A) then'."

This grammar point is usually translated as 'to do (A) in such a way that will enable (B)', or 'in order to allow (B)'. To use ように in this way, simply add it to the non-past form of any verb in its negative, potential , or standard conjugation. As mentioned in our lesson about potential verbs, する does not actually have a potential form, and therefore できる will be used instead."

When preceded by a verb in its dictionary form, it just conveys that 'there is no choice but (A)', or that '(A) cannot be helped'. Occasionally the が will be dropped, between 仕方 and ない. Keeping almost exactly the same style of translation is a similar pattern, より 他 にない . The only actual difference is that this structure expresses that there is no 'other' alternative, rather than being no 'method'. The noun 他 'other' and に will simply replace 仕方 'method' and が. As with 仕方 が, the に will often be dropped in 他 に. Both よりしかたがない and よりほかにない have a tendency to express some particular evaluation of (A) that cannot be helped or denied, or simply that 'given the situation, (A) cannot be avoided'."

Like most sentence ending particles, it is simply added to the end of almost any sentence. Despite the standard use of よ being to convey new information, it is also very regularly paired with ね , to convey the meaning of 'right?!'. This more literally means something closer to 'I think (A), and I bet you think (A) too!'. Caution Did you notice that there is a だ after the noun, but not the い-Adjective ? This is not a unique rule for よ , but just one of the regular conjugation rules introduced in the lessons for い-Adjectives and な-Adjectives . It is also acceptable to use です よ after either type of adjective (or noun)."

This structure will be used directly after the non-past form of verbs, in order to highlight them as being either highly undesirable, or highly unattainable. Although わけにはいかない primarily highlights things that are undesirable, it may also highlight something that is desirable, but impossible for some reason. This will depend largely on the speaker's tone of voice, and context of the conversation. In these types of sentences, the expression is quite similar to the 'I guess it's just not meant to be so' nuance that can be conveyed in English, highlighting regret."

                        "content": "わ is an adverbial particle that is commonly used in cases of stress of emphasis in Japanese. When appearing after the dictionary form of a verb that is being repeated, it highlights a large amount, something happening successively, or more and more. It will often be translated as 'more and more (A)', '(A) keeps on happening', or 'so much (A)'. わ～わ may be used either positively or negatively. To use this structure, simply place わ after the verb, and then repeat the same verb with a second わ . わ～わ primarily emphasizes the speaker's surprise in regard to the amount or extent of (A). This structure is predominantly used by men, but it may also sometimes be used by women. However, there are several different variations of わ depending on where they appear in sentences, each of which have gender usage tendencies that will need to be learned. In many cases where a する verb is being used with わ～わ , the second instance of the action will be omitted, with する appearing by itself. For example, instead of 勉強 する わ 勉強 する わ , 勉強 する わ する わ would be used. Fun Fact わ is simply an emphatic version of the usual は adverbial particle , and originates from は being changed to わ . Due to this, the literal meaning can be thought of as a stronger version of the standard 'as for (A)' meaning of は. This would come across something like 'as for (A), it did (A)', with the repetition itself adding to the emphasis."

                        "content": "When used with time related expressions, the structure をもって is often translated as 'as of (A)', or 'effective from (A)'. This grammar pattern is a construction of the adverbial particle を, and もって 'by means of'. をもって will be used after nouns that indicate a time, or an event that happens at a specific time. As is frequently seen in polite speech or in official notifications, をもって may sometimes be read as をもちまして . Alternatively, the small っ (called a 促音 ) may occasionally be dropped. This results in をもて. Caution Although 'effective from' can have the nuance of 'starting' in English, をもって primarily focuses on something ending, or what has happened up until the end date specified. Due to this, it will not be used to indicate that something is starting from a date that had nothing significant happen before it. Fun Fact Coming from the kanji 以 て, and specifically meaning 'by means of', もって originally derives its nuance from 持 って, 'to hold', or 'to have'. In this way, it may help to remember もって as working in a similar way to 'having (A)', or 'having reached (A)' in English."

The case marking particle に just marks '(A) を 中心 に ' as the target that is being focused on. Due to 中心 itself marking a 'central point', it may also be used just to express the middle of something, rather than something that is being concentrated or focused on. By adding する in either its dictionary or past forms, を 中心 にする or を 中心 にした may appear before another noun. This will highlight the noun that comes after as being the overall thing through which the 'focus on (A)' is taking place. Additionally, the case-marking particle と may sometimes replace に.

This is often translated as 'to (A) at the same time as (B)', 'to double as (A)', or 'to (A) also partly for the purpose of (B)'. を 兼 ねて often highlights (B) as the primary goal, where (A) is something that acts to support it, makes sense to be done together, or just gives the speaker a good excuse to do (B). In order to remember that (A) is actually the secondary goal in this structure, using the literal translation of 'while extending across to (A), (B)' may help. In the case of multiple goals existing, the case-marking particle と will be used for listing of nouns."

This grammar point can be translated as 'concerning (A)', 'in regard to (A)', or 'about (A)'. However, following the most natural translation, we can see that 'to go around the topic of (A)', or 'encompassing (A)' are also acceptable. Caution In addition to being quite formal, を 巡 って keeps the 'around the topic of (A)' nuance that comes from the stem verb. This means that rather than expressing one opinion, it takes into consideration many different viewpoints, and is frequently used when there is a disagreement or dispute about (A). Because of this, it can sound quite unnatural to use を 巡 って if the topic of (A) is simply a personal opinion."

Either の or に will usually come after んがため , depending on whether it is followed directly by a noun, or a statement linking to a verb. The meaning of む is kept in ん, as this grammar structure will imply the speaker's will to achieve the goal of (A). As む expresses intent, the verb that ん is attached to must be something that can be controlled by the speaker. Caution Like most classical structures that interact with する, the more old-fashioned せ will be used as the base, rather than し."

It is thought to be a combination of ん, an abbreviation of む, the classical auxiliary verb used to show intent or strong will in the same way as う and よう, and the adverbial particle ばかり, exhibiting that something is 'basically exactly as described'. As a result, んばかり simply indicates the volitional form of (A) as appearing to be about to happen. んばかりに will appear linked to the indeterminate form of verbs (ない stem), and then followed by a statement that is being modified by the に. If んばかり will modify a noun instead, の will replace に. Caution When attached to the indeterminate form of verbs, there is some contention among linguists whether ん is an abbreviation of む, the classical way of expressing う or よう, or whether it is an abbreviation of ぬ, the classical way of expressing ない. Due to being unable to accurately determine what the actual origin is, it would be advisable to choose whichever variation helps to remember the nuance of the grammar point on a case-by-case basis."

Although 上 げる and 上 がる show that something has been done 'to the limit', the nuance is usually 'to do (A) to the point of completion', or 'to do (A) through to the end'. Therefore, the 'limit' that is being highlighted is usually a natural ending, and not due to running out of some kind of resource. Let's have a look at some examples. 上 げる and 上 がる are most commonly used when some kind of effect or product is produced as a result of the (A) action. In these cases, the literal meaning of 'to (A) up' is very similar to 'to finish up (A)' in English. Caution 仕上 がる is a very common expression that is used for many things. Usually it conveys that something has been completed after some involved or time consuming process."

As with many other grammar points, the particle is often dropped, leaving 以上 by itself. Due to である 以上 は often presenting something which is being acted upon, the (B) part of sentences that include this grammar structure will frequently include the resolutions or intentions of the speaker, and can be thought of as either obvious or necessary once considering (A). This usually appears in the form of べきだ, つもりだ, はずだ, たい, ほうがいい, and similar patterns. Fun-fact Despite the standard translations, the literal meaning of 'above and beyond (A), (B)' is also a good way to remember this grammar pattern, as it basically highlights that anything 'past', 'beyond', or 'above' (A) is what needs to be considered."

As an adverb, 僅 か will appear as 僅 かに .

Let's look at some examples. Unlike 切 る , which usually attaches to verbs to show that something was done to the point of running out, 切 れない often implies the exact opposite. This means that the (A) verb cannot be completed specifically because there is too much/many of something in order to finish it. 切 れない may also imply that something cannot be done 'to the point of satisfaction'. In this case, the feeling of dissatisfaction is what the speaker considers too much to overcome."

Although this kanji is used to mark 'each', it is very rarely used to mark units of time. The most common/natural usage of 各 is for identifying things that are part of a sequence. For example: Each/Every stop, on a train line that has many stops. Each/Every page, in a book that has many pages. Each/Every floor, in a building that has many floors. Each/Every house, in a street of many houses. Fun Fact This kanji is used in another word, 各々 , which also means 'each', but is primarily used for identifying people."

In almost all circumstances, it can be translated directly as 'depending on', and will be followed by either the auxiliary verb だ at the end of sentences, or the conjunctive form of だ, で, when used in the middle of a sentence. いかん will follow nouns, and may or may not be preceded by の. Occasionally, いかん will be followed by によって. This may seem like repetition for no particular reason, but in most cases it will just strengthen the original meaning of 'depending on', and can be literally translated as 'depending on what way (A) is oriented, (B)'. いかん itself is used in a very similar way to 次第 'upon (A)', or 'depending on (A)', and more often than not implies that the degree of (A) will be the factor that determines the overall result. Due to this, it will often be followed by subclauses that use verbs of decision making such as 決 まる. Fun Fact いかん , like いかに, is simply another word that has the same meaning as どう 'how', and even shares the same kanji structure of 如何 , 如何 . It is also quite common to see the structure かどうであるによって 'depending on in what way' used as an explanation for the meaning of いかん in various dictionaries and other teaching resources. Due to this, it may be beneficial to simply consider いかん as a less common version of どう, or かどうである."

This similarity can be seen in the following: (A) 当 たり (B) - Regarding (A), (B) equates to it. (A) に 対 して (B) - Regarding (A), (B) equates to it."

However, 必 ずしも is an expression that is only used in negative sentences, so is commonly translated as 'not always (A)', 'not entirely (A)', or 'not necessarily (A)'.

It is an expression that is primarily used as a formal, positive alternative for 時 に, but there are times that it may indicate something negative. 折 に may be seen after any structure that could connect to a noun, but will primarily appear after verbs in their standard forms , or nouns followed by の. Additionally, 折 に may occasionally appear as 折 には, but the additional は if often omitted. In most cases, 折 に will be used to indicate things that happen 'from time to time', rather than one off events. Caution 折 に appears in several common expressions that each have a slightly different meaning. 折 に 触 れて - On the occasion of (A), always (B). 折 があれば -  If there is the chance of (A), (B). 折 を 見 て - When the conditions are good for (A). 折 も 折 - At the exact moment of (A)."

In this lesson, we will look at the meaning associated with the conjunctive form of standard verbs, and the stem of する verbs. Although it is a noun, 次第 may also be classified simply as a suffix in many cases. Basically, 次第 means 'next in sequence after (A)', and is often translated to 'as soon as (A)'. Fun Fact One of the most important things to keep in mind with 次第 , is that the literal meaning in almost every situation is 'determining sequence'. This is unlike any standard phrase in English, but simply expresses that (A) is what will govern (B). Let's look at how this translates with different word types. Verb 次第 - Verb determines the sequence of (B). Since a verb is not capable of making a choice, (A) simply 'happening' will result in (B). Living noun 次第 - Noun determines the sequence of (B). Since living things can make choices, (B) will depend on (A). Inanimate/abstract noun 次第 - Noun determines the sequence of (B). Since inanimate/abstract things cannot make choices, (A) will determine (B)'s course of action. (B) will usually involve some kind of decision."

To use 点 , attach it to the attributive form of another word, a noun followed by の, or a phrase followed by という. In many cases, 点 will be followed by the case marking particle で, but other particles may be used depending whether 点 is being conveyed as a subject, object, destination, or something being utilized. Sometimes, で (as 'with' or 'at') may be replaced with expressions such as について 'in relation to (A)', or からいうと 'speaking from (A)'. So long as the grammar structure that accompanies 点 is also used to highlight something specific (and can be paired with a noun), it will sound natural."

                        "content": "的 is a 接語尾 (suffix) in Japanese that has two primary uses. The first use is very similar to 'as' or 'for' in English, and means 'considering/within the category of (A), (B)'. The second use primarily relates to people, and will be covered later. As a single word, 的 is often likened to adjective endings such as '~ly', '~like', and '~al'. To use 的 , attach it to the end of a noun that you want to express as being the focus point of either a verb or a noun that will come later in the sentence. When describing a noun, 的 will be followed by な (meaning that it becomes a な-Adjective ). When describing a verb, it will be followed by に (making it an adverb). Fun Fact The second common use of 的 is specifically with the names of people, and highlights that (B) is something that is being considered in regard to (A). (A) being the person mentioned. This may be used either positively or negatively. In English, this is similar to 'that's so (A)', or 'just what you'd expect of (A)'. Fun Fact The easiest way to understand and use 的 correctly almost all the time, is by knowing another common suffix , 圏 . Let's look at how these suffixes compare: 圏 - Occurring in the sphere of (A), (B). (B) only happens inside of (A). 的 - Speaking in the sphere of (A), (B). (B) can only be said within the sphere of (A). As we can see here, when you want to convey something that can be said from a specific standpoint, 的 will be a logical choice."

Alternatively, に can be replaced by other case marking particle such as と or の.

However, they are almost always used in somewhat hypothetical sentences, and translate much closer to 'one can only but (B)'. This nuance indicates a sense of resignation, or understanding on the part of the speaker that they personally have no options beyond (B). This grammar pattern will be used following verbs in their dictionary form , and will often come at the end of a sentence that uses なら in the first clause. In this way, it will mean 'if (A), then (B) is all that can be done'. (A) will almost always be a negative situation. Examining the standard meaning of the particle まで as signifying an extent, it can be seen that this meaning is kept in までだ, with the speaker expressing that (B) is the extent of what is possible given the negative circumstances brought about by (A)."

The noun specified by の 内 may represent a range or a limit, and is not limited to appearing with numbers. Like の 中 , it may also appear followed by から in place of で. のうち is far less common than のなか when specifying 'amongst', due to this, のなか will be the preferred (more natural) option in speech.

This is quite emphatic, and has a literal meaning similar to 'say it does (A) or say it doesn't (A), it will still be (B)'. As a reminder, the positive auxiliary verbs of volition are either う or よう, depending on what they are being connected to, while the negative auxiliary verb of volition is まい. Either the case marking particle が or と will appear after both the positive and the negative, with が being slightly more common. While this structure is primarily seen after verbs, it is important to remember that other auxiliary verbs such as だ can be conjugated in the same way, as can い-Adjectives with the less common かろう structure. This means that both nouns, な-Adjectives and い-Adjectives can also appear using a similar grammar pattern. However, because the negative volitional まい cannot pair with these structures, an antonym will usually appear with them instead, with both words using the う or よう positive volitional. Based primarily on the use of volitionals, this grammar pattern will often indicate the speaker's strong will or opinion that will not change regardless of (A)."

Building on from the adjective +て, noun + で grammar point, instead of linking adjectives, adjective + て + (B) is used for linking an adjective to an entire phrase. With this construction, the phrase is simply added after て (with い-Adjectives ), or で (with nouns and な-Adjectives ), without any extra consideration for the phrase following it (this means that the (B) phrase will behave as if it was its own sentence). As with adjective +て, noun + で , it should be noted that て and で are different structures here. て is the same conjunction particle that is used with verbs (meaning that い-Adjectives are similar to verbs), while で is actually a form of だ that is used for conjugation. It is the same で as the one that is used in the formal version of だ , である . Which we will learn later. Caution Like other て forms ( ている 1 , ている 2 , and ている 3 ), the て (or で ) form of other words can have several possible meanings. These meanings are as follows. Linking - Like 'and' in English. Reasons - Like 'with (A)', or 'because of (A)' in English. Manner - Like 'to do (B) in an (A) way' in English. Caution As with all other conjugations of いい , remember that it will be よくて, and not いくて."

                        "content": "In order to express that someone was 'made to do', or 'let do' something, the auxiliary verbs せる and させる will be used. The meaning that せる and させる will convey (when attached to a verb) is called 使役 (causative, employment, or using) in Japanese. A common misconception is that せる and させる are standard conjugations of each verb. However, these auxiliary verbs should be thought of as having their own meaning, in a similar way to how たい , ない, だ , です , and other auxiliaries each have their own meanings. In order to use these grammar structures, remove the る from る-Verbs , and then add させる . For う-Verbs , change the last kana to the あ sound kana from within the same column (except for う, which becomes わ), and then add せる (る becomes ら, む becomes ま, く becomes か, etc.). As usual, する and 来 る have special conjugation rules. する will be replaced completely by させる (in a similar way to how できる completely replaces する in the ' potential ' form). 来 る will become 来 させる . Caution With causative, either に , or を can mark the doer of the action that せる, or させる is linked to (not が). This is because the actual 'doer' of the action is considered to be the person that is making/letting someone perform that action. に will usually imply that someone was 'let' do something, while を implies 'make'. Fun Fact Because the actual 'doer' in causative verb sentences will be marked with が (as is always the case), the literal translation of せる and させる is closer to the following: (A) が (B) に 楽しま せる - For (A) to cause fun 'in' (B). (A) が (B) を 楽しま せる - For (A) to cause fun 'through' (B). It is these standard meanings of the particles に (a location) and を (a target) that will create the 'let', or 'make' nuance when using せる , or させる ."

To use this construction, the number that you want to express as being 'all that exists' will go before しか , then しか will be followed by a verb in its ない, or ありません form. Fun Fact The main difference between しか and だけ , is that だけ suggests that (A) was 'chosen' from among a group where several other choices exist. しか on the other hand, implies that there are no other choices, and (A) is the only possibility/thing that exists."

Sentence Ending Particle: 終助詞 - Highlights doubts and questions ' 疑問 や 質問 '. This is a direct question. In the case of the adverbial particle か and 'uncertain things', this will almost always be followed by a word that is seeking information about the uncertain thing. As can be seen in these examples, sometimes the adverbial particle will appear by itself, and sometimes it will appear together with the sentence ending particle in the same sentence. However, due to the 'uncertainty' being displayed by the adverbial particle, the question marker at the end of the sentence is not required. Caution This か should not be preceded by だ (or です ), this is why words like どこか and 誰 か are not どこ だか and 誰 だか."

                        "content": "In Japanese, there are several ways to express that something 'passively' happens. All of these are done with the auxiliary verbs れる and られる . Japanese verbs in the passive form behave in a slightly different way than they do in English, so we will examine this difference more closely later. For now, let's focus on れる , られる , and さ れる (the form used with する verbs). Passivity in Japanese means that the person (or thing) that is the target of the action will be the subject of the sentence, rather than the person that is 'doing' whatever verb is being used. You can conjugate any Japanese verb into the passive form in the following way. For う-Verbs (godan verbs), simply replace the last kana with the equivalent あ sound kana from the same row (す becomes さ, つ becomes た, ぶ becomes ば, う becomes わ, like with ない, and so on), then add れる , or られる . For る-Verbs (ichidan verbs), just replace the る with られる . する and くる behave slightly differently than most other verbs. For する , it will become さ れる , while くる will become こ られる . As can be seen in these examples, the 'doer' of the verb will be marked with に , but から can also be used in cases where there is no physical contact with the subject. Caution られる can be used in several different situations. These are listed below. Passive: 受 け 身 - Something happens to the subject as a result of an external force (sometimes sounds negative). Possible: 可能 - There is the possibility for something to be done. Spontaneous: 自発 - Something happens by itself, or 'without instigation'. Respectful: 尊敬 - You are respecting someone by making them the subject of the sentence, despite someone else actually performing the verb. Fun Fact In Japanese, passivity focuses on the lack of control of the subject of the sentence. Due to this, the subject will sometimes be called the なる人, while the doer of the verb is called the する 人. Traditionally, many textbooks use the term ' passive ', simply because there is no equivalent verb type in English ( passive is the closest). However, we would like to introduce the term 'displacement verb'. This just means that the subject of the sentence is being described in a similar way to what happens in keigo (polite speech). Caution But wait, what about れる with る-Verbs ! Well, in Japanese, ら removal words 'ラ 抜 き 言葉 ' are very common. These are words that are able to use れる , instead of られる . The original meaning of both of these auxiliary verbs is exactly the same, but there are cases where ら may not be removed. The standard rules are as follows. ら may be removed - る-Verbs and くる , when the meaning is 'possible'. ら may not be removed - る-Verbs and くる , when the meaning is 'passive', 'spontaneous', or 'respectful'. In both of these sentences, the meaning is exactly the same. However, ラ 抜 き may only be used when られる is being used to highlight ' possibility '."

Phrases that use this particular (A) て (B) nuance of the て-form primarily express something that is beyond the control of the speaker in the (B) statement. To use this grammar construction, pair the て-form of a verb or い-Adjective with the (B) phrase. In the case of nouns and な-Adjectives , で (the particle) will be used instead. Fun Fact The 'because' nuance of て (or で ) in this grammar construction is primarily influenced by the (B) phrase being something that is uncontrollable, rather than being a different meaning of the particles て , or で themselves. Literally the meaning is closer to the following: (A) て 困 る - Being troubled cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て 嬉 しい - Being happy cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て 大変 - Having a problem cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て びっくり - Being surprised cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て 疲 れている - Being worn-out cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. (A) て 心配 - Feeling anxiety cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it. Many other words, such as the ones listed above will cause て (or で ) to have a similar nuance. てすみません also uses this meaning of て , as すみません is a feeling that the speaker cannot control, relating to the situation being left unfinished."

When it is partnered with a verb, it has special conjugation rules, depending on whether it is being added to a る-Verb or a う-Verb . In the case of う-Verbs , it also depends on what the preceding kana is. The most common translation in any situation is just 'and' or 'then', due to (B) being highlighted as something that happens/happened after (A). In these examples, we can see that て basically means '(A) て (B)' = '(A) happened, then (B)'. However, this is only when it is linked to another verb. Sometimes the て form appears as で . This is a change that happened throughout the course of history, in order to make sentences flow more smoothly. Despite this, there is no difference in meaning between て and で as a vocal change. The easiest way to identify whether to use て or で is by looking at the preceding kana. If the plain (dictionary) form of the verb finishes in ぐ, ぬ, ぶ, or む, then で will be used. る-Verbs never use で . Caution There are several irregular verbs when it comes to て form conjugation. Let's look at an example of each one. Apart from these 5 verbs, the rules for て form conjugation are 100% consistent."

As these structures are in the passive, the literal translation is close to 'to do (B) in the state that (A) was done to me'. The (B) part will come directly after ままに and simply states how someone is going to react in compliance with (A). The conjunction particle が may appear between られる and ままに, but this is not common in modern Japanese. Although it does carry the meaning of 'but', the focus is more on expressing that the (A) is not being resisted or argued with when doing (B).

In these cases, the translation becomes 'to have tried to do (A), but (B)', 'was about to (A), but (B), or 'was on the verge of (A), but (B)'. う and よう mark volition (the express intent to do something), while とする adds the nuance that the express intent has been decided, and all that remains is to 'do' the action. Due to this, when something interrupts a ようとする verb, it strongly suggests that (B) is/was highly unanticipated."
