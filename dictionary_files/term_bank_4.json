The place that あそこ will be used to identify is somewhere that is separated from both the speaker and the listener. This translates roughly to 'that place over there' in English. あそこ can be used to identify both physical locations, and emotional ones. In the same way that あれ can be used to point back to something that was mentioned previously, あそこ can be used to point back to a place that was mentioned previously. However, unlike それ or そこ , あれ and あそこ will only be used this way when both the speaker and listener have intimate knowledge of the topic. Caution あそこ should not be confused with あっち, a similar word which is also sometimes translated as 'over there'. あっち focuses more on the direction that one is/is going, while あそこ focuses purely on 'that place'."

Often, あまりに is translated simply as 'so much (A) that (B)', or 'way too much (A)'. In the last example, we can see that あまり will be followed by の when linked to a noun. Occasionally, にも will be used instead of に . This just emphasizes the 'excess' of (A) further. As the literal meaning of あまりに is quite close to 'excessively', it may be easier to remember this translation, rather than 'so much (A) that (B)'. Usually, 'it is excessively (A), so (B)' will cover most possible nuances. Caution あんまり is a colloquial variant of あまり that is often said, but should be avoided in any form of formal/official writing."

However, unlike どんな (which is an abbreviation of どのような), いくら is a noun that comes from the kanji 幾 ら, meaning 'how much'. When partnered with ても (with verbs and い-Adjectives ), or でも (with nouns and な-Adjectives ), the literal meaning means 'however much (A), (B)'. With いくら～でも, the (B) part of the phrase will usually highlight something that is being negated, giving the phrase it's 'no matter how much' nuance. Despite this trend of being used in sentences that contain ない or ありません, いくら～でも may also be seen in positive sentences. In these cases, despite not being negative, the (B) phrase will still be something that is surprising/unexpected in some way (due to its extent or amount). Fun Fact 幾 ら places more emphasis on the 'amount' of something, while どんなに places more emphasis on the 'type', or 'style'. Due to this, いくら will be a better choice when the 'volume' of something is being highlighted, while どんなに will sound more natural when the 'state' is being discussed. Despite this small difference, いくら and どんなに are used fairly interchangeably in most situations."

This is a slightly advanced concept that we will discuss more later. To use いらっしゃる , simply replace いる , くる , or いく with いらっしゃる . Alternatively, いらっしゃる may also be used to replace いる , くる , or いく when they are attached to the て-form of another verb. Fun Fact おいでになる is another expression which can replace いる , くる , or いく.

However, depending on the type of word used, conjugation rules will differ slightly. For い-Adjectives , they are simply attached to the front of the noun in their standard (dictionary) form. Caution When identifying what is an い-Adjective , and what is not, remember that an い-Adjective will always have the い outside of any kanji that are in the word. However, the reverse situation with な-Adjectives always having the い in the kanji is not true 100% of the time. 面白 い - The い is outside of the kanji, so 'interesting' is almost definitely an い-Adjective . 綺麗 - The い is inside of the kanji, so 'clean' is definitely not an い-Adjective . One example of an exception as mentioned above is 嫌 い. Despite the い being outside of the kanji, 'hate' is actually a な-Adjective . Don't worry though, less than 1% of any adjective that has い on the outside of the kanji will actually be a な-Adjective !"

For the ませんでした (polite) form, rather than the final kana changing to the あ sound kana from the same column, it will change to the い sound kana from the same column. The negative past form is used to convey that something 'did not happen', or 'was not'. A semi-polite form may also be used. This is constructed by using なかった , and then simply adding です . This form is not grammatically correct, but is so common that most sources (and native speakers) would consider it correct. ある is an exception to the regular conjugation rules of う-Verbs . The casual past-negative is not あらなかった, but simply なかった . However, the polite past-negative form conjugates in the same way as would be expected for う-Verbs. ありませんでした ."

This structure stems from the common use of the noun お 負 け which indicates a 'discount' or 'freebie' that is added in addition to the base of (A). Despite お 負 け itself primarily being used for positive things お 負 けに may convey 'in addition', 'on top of that', or 'what's more' regardless of whether the original topic is a good thing or not. However, (A) and (B) will always either be both good things, or both bad things, never a mixture of both. Being a combination of お 負 け and に, this phrase will appear either at the beginning of a new sentence, or at the beginning of a second clause of a 2-part sentence. Fun-fact An important distinction between phrases like それに and お 負 けに is that お 負 けに keeps its original meaning of (B) being some kind of 'bonus'. What this means is that whatever the speaker is trying to convey, (A) by itself is enough to meet some specific qualifications, and (B) is just adding 'insult to injury', or 'icing on the cake', depending on whether it is a good or a bad thing."

This is opposed to honorific language , which refers exclusively to the listener and their actions. お〜する is almost exactly the same as お～になる , as in it simply means する . お〜する is regularly used with words of Japanese origin, while ご～する will be used with words of Chinese origin. The する in this compound will attach directly to the ます stem of almost any verb. Caution While the する in this structure will attach directly to the ます stem of verbs, this does not mean that verbs that are already する verbs will become しする. In the case of する verbs, simply change the prefix to ご. In rare cases, お may be used instead of ご, when attached to words of Chinese origin. There is no specific rule for this, and they must be memorized on a case by case basis. Thankfully, the words of Chinese origin that use お instead of ご are extremely common verbs. This means that you will be exposed to almost all of them very quickly. All others may be assumed to use ご. Fun Fact In the same way that お～になる is a more common variation of なさる (both honorific language ), お〜する is a more common variation of いたす (both humble speech )."

This is  similar to 向 け . かけ comes from the verb 掛 ける 'to suspend', and may be attached to the conjunctive form or other verbs, in order to convey that they are 'unfinished'. Usually this translates as 'half (A)', 'about to (A)', or 'not yet finished (A)'. かけ behaves like a noun, so may be followed by the case marking particle の when attached directly to another noun, or by だ when at the end of a sentence. Occasionally, the verb 掛 ける itself may be used instead of the noun form, かけ . Fun Fact As the literal meaning of 掛 ける is 'to suspend', it expresses that something is stuck somewhere in the process of happening. This is similar to taking a photo of someone that is jumping. In the photo it will look like they are 'suspended', but that is only because one particular moment has been captured, somewhere between the start and the finish. かけ conveys exactly the same meaning, and therefore may be interpreted differently, depending on the verb it is paired with. With verbs that express a momentary action (something that cannot be 'half' done), かけ will convey that the action was 'on the verge of' happening. However, with verbs that are ongoing actions, かけ will simply imply that they are 'in the process' of being done."

Fun-fact As 兼 ねる means 'to spread across', this expression can be thought of as similar to 'to be a stretch' in English.

It has quite a literal meaning in that a number is 'going from (A)', where (A) is the start point and the speaker doesn't know the exact amount. In addition to からする , からの may be used with the same meaning. However, unlike する, because の must attach directly to a second noun, からの is a bit more limited in the way it will be used. Caution Due to からする being used for giving an estimation, it has a tendency to only appear when the number or amount of something is quite large, and the speaker is emphasizing that the actual number cannot be guessed. Because of this, it may sound quite unnatural when used with small numbers. Caution からする tends to be used most frequently in regard to money, while からの will be used when referring to people and other general amounts. In the case of things like weight, size, or distance, からある , another similar structure will be used. からある will be covered in its own grammar point."

This is primarily when more than (A) is available as a choice, but the speaker isn't specifying a list just yet.

(B) may just be considered as something done while doing (A), or as being done specifically because (A) is a good opportunity to do it. This structure may be used either with or without kanji, so it will be important to remember both.

However, in most cases it just means to lay, extend, or place something across either a physical or metaphorical surface or span.

It is similar to ながら in that it will be translated as 'while (A), (B)', 'during (A), (B)', or 'on the occasion of (A)'. When (A) is a noun, it will almost always be a noun that signifies some sort of physical movement. Unlike ながら, がてら focuses more on (A) being a good opportunity which can be utilized or taken advantage of in order to do (B). Fun Fact がてら is a vocal change of がてり, which originally comes from an abbreviation of the conjunctive form of 糅 つ, かて 'to mix together', and あり. So かてあり was abbreviated to かてり, which then went through sound changes to がてり and がてら . However, the 'being mixed together' meaning is still kept in the modern day nuance of this grammar point."

                        "content": "がる is a う-Verb that is primarily used as a suffix in Japanese. When used in this way, it means 'to act like (A)', or 'to show signs of being (A)', where (A) is the word that it is attached to. To use がる , you will need to link it to the stem form of an い-Adjective (simply remove the い), or to the stem form of a な-Adjective (do not include the な). がる is a verb which means 'to give the impression of (A)', or 'to act like (A)'. This is very important in Japanese, as you would not usually say how somebody else feels, unless they told you directly and you are simply repeating what you heard (in which case you would use the quotation particle と ). When you want to express the way you 'think' that someone else feels, but don't have any direct information about it, that is when がる would be natural to use. For example, if you see someone shivering in the cold, you would say something like the following. The main difference between がる , and がっている , is that がる will be used when a person usually/always acts a certain way, whereas がっている is more about the way someone/something is acting in any specific moment. Caution がる may also be used to describe yourself (in the third person). This is when you want to express the way you think that you act/are acting, or a way you assume other people view your behavior. Fun Fact The use of がっている to express an 'in the moment' way that someone is acting, is slowly becoming less and less common in modern Japanese. Regularly, そう will be used instead, to express that someone (or something) 'seems' a certain way."

Because the group in this sentence is only one group out of many possible 'groups of people' that could be described, が will be used. Caution が is not usually used to describe something about yourself, unless you are intentionally describing yourself compared to other people.

This is frequently translated as 'only', 'just', or 'since'. きり comes from the う - Verb 切 る 'to cut'. きり is often used after the plain past form of verbs, with nouns, or with counters. Let's look at verbs first. With verbs, きり is primarily used to show that (A) occurring was all that was required for (B). Usually, this results in some permanent consequence, or permanent change of opinion. In almost every situation, (A) is something that has only happened once, and きり can be interpreted as 'ever since'. When it comes to the use of きり with nouns or counters, it will express that something is happening with (A) as the limit 'nothing more, nothing less'. In other words, (A) is all that will be included in some particular situation/action. Caution きり may also be seen as っきり or キリ . There is no specific change in nuance, but っきり is the most common casual form."

Despite translating in the above ways, we can see that this use of くらい is similar to the standard kanji use 位 , which literally means a 'rank', or 'grade' of something.

In all of these cases, the addition of げ creates a new な-Adjective meaning '(A) seeming'. Due to this, げ may then be followed by either な or に, depending on whether it is altering a verb or a noun later in the sentence. げ is more subjective (based on the speaker's opinion) than そう, and is considered to be very low confidence. This may be considered a byproduct of the original 気 , meaning of 'attention', referring to the way that the speaker 'senses (A)', regardless of what is actually true for (A) on the inside."

When making assumptions, ことだから will often be seen following verbs in their dictionary forms, or nouns followed by の. Alternatively, ことだから may appear following verbs in any of their standard forms when the situation of (A) is considered as a good opportunity to also do (B), according to the speaker. Lastly, ことだから may simply imply (strongly) that (A) is the reason for (B). In these cases, either verbs in their standard forms or nouns followed by の may precede ことだから . Despite having these three slightly different nuances, the speaker's intended meaning will usually be clear in the (B) part of the sentence. Due to this, ことだから may always be thought to simply mean that 'by the logic of (A), definitely (B)'."

However; ことなく is used in more formal situations, and when there is some contrast between (A) and (B). This may appear in one of two ways, which we will discuss in a moment. ことなく is a mix of こと, and なく, the adverbial form of ない. It will follow the dictionary form of verbs. The first contrastive use of ことなく illustrates that (A) is something negative, to which (B) should be done as a preventative measure, or was able to be done while avoiding (A). The second use of ことなく highlights when (A) is something that was or would be wished for, but unfortunately (B) happened without it being realized. In this way, (A) is frequently some kind of unmet desire."

This expression can be translated as 'to become (A)', but has the nuance that someone/thing caused (A) to become that way. Due to this, it may also be translated as 'it has been decided that (A)', or 'it will end up being (A)'. ことになる is primarily used with verbs and い-Adjectives in their attributive form . It may also be used with な-Adjectives followed by な. The 'it has been decided that (A)' meaning only applies to verbs, as only verbs will be enacted by someone/thing. Fun Fact This structure is a good example of why なる is often viewed as the intransitive form of する . する conveys that someone is performing an action (transitive), while なる implies that something is the result of an action (intransitive). This is why the (A)  phrase in ことになる is usually determined to have been decided/performed by someone else, while still focusing on exactly 'what' (A) became."

This simply emphasizes that the speaker recognizes (A) as being true, but would like to express information that is contrary to that. ことは～が can appear with any type of word, but だ will need to be used following nouns before が, while な, である, だった or ではない tends to follow な-Adjectives.

It is considered polite speech , and is directly equivalent to ある (or いる ). ござる itself is almost never used in daily conversation in modern Japanese, due to the preference of the polite form, ございます . However, ござる is regularly used in dramas, manga, and other forms of media (especially historical dramas). Fun Fact 御座 る literally means 'to be', and it does not matter whether the object that is being described is animate (would usually use いる), or inanimate (would usually use ある). However, いらっしゃる 'to be' is preferred when referring to other people, as honorific language is more respectful than polite speech . Due to this, ございます will often be used in reference to people, in place of であります (the polite form of である ). Notice that で is used in these examples. でございます itself is considered its own grammatical structure, that we will examine in a separate grammar point."

It is often translated as 'even'. さえ has three primary meanings, which are as follows: Analogical Reasoning: 類推 - Analogy, (A) is an outstanding example of something. Limit: 限定 - Limit, (A) is all that is needed for something. Addition: 添加 - (A) compounds something that is pre-existing. さえ is regularly paired with other particles and is often followed by verbs in negative form, with the overall meaning usually being determined by what part (B) of the sentence is conveying. Let's look at a few examples. In each of these cases, we can see how さえ is showing that (A) is an extreme example of something. Fun Fact は, も, でも, and さえ are all adverbial particles that can be thought of as having a relationship toward, and away from what is 'expected' in any given situation. This relationship can be seen here: (A) は - (A) is completely expected, there is nothing unusual. (A) も - (A) will be included as part of what is expected, but can be unusual. (A) でも - (A) may or may not be included as part of what is expected, and can be unusual. (A) さえ - (A) is separated completely from what is expected, and is unusual. Due to this unexpected and unusual situation that さえ always presents, it is regularly translated as 'let alone (A)', or 'not to mention (A)'."

This use is an extension of the base meaning that the kanji 更 has in indicating that something is 'approaching change'. Because of this, the expression used following 更 に will always be something that is either further along than the initial statement either in regard to time, quantity, or volume. Taking this into consideration, 'in addition to (A)' may also be used as a fairly standard translation. As さらに is used adverbially, it often appears at the beginning of part (B) of a sentence, after the 'base' information has already been indicated. Fun-fact The meaning of 更 as 'approaching change' merely indicates that something has already reached 'fullness', and anything more than that will cause a fundamental change in the state of (A). Due to this, さらに primarily indicates things where (A) is considered 'complete' or 'enough' in and of itself, and what happens in (B) pushes that thing beyond a certain threshold. This may be either positive or negative depending on the sentence."

When this happens, it transforms the target adjective into a noun that illustrates the 'amount' of that particular adjective. This commonly translates as '-ness' in English (sweetness, tallness, spiciness, etc), but is referred to as degree in Japanese. Fun Fact It is thought that this suffix originally stemmed from the kanji 差 (meaning 'distinction'), and was used for highlighting things that were distinctive features of something. In this way, さ is also sometimes used after the dictionary form of verbs, to highlight a distinct point in time that something happens. However, this use of the suffix is far less common in modern Japanese, and is known as ' poetic language '. It was primarily used during Japan's 'middle ages', which spanned from (around) 1100, until close to the end of the 1500's."

                        "content": "しかない is a commonly used expression in Japanese that is partnered with verbs. It is a combination of しか, the adverbial particle , and the い-Adjective ない. This structure may be translated as 'to have no choice but (A)', or 'there is only (A)'. しかない regularly emphasizes the point that nothing apart from (A) is possible. To use しかない , simply attach it directly to the non-past form of whichever verb you would like to highlight as being the 'only' possible action. Unlike だけ, which implies that one particular option was chosen (out of several), しか always insinuates that (A) is the only option, and therefore will sound much stronger than だけ. Also, as only one option exists, it will often be assumed by the listener that some particular circumstances resulted in (A) being all that can be done. Fun Fact Occasionally, しかない may be used in manga, anime, or other forms of media that use casual language. In these cases, it is not uncommon to see しか abbreviated to っきゃ, resulting in っきゃない. However, this is not a common abbreviation in daily language."

Due to this, it indicates that there is 'no (A)', '(A) never happens', or 'not (A) at all', depending on whether a verb or an adjective is the word that is being negated. すこしも can come at the beginning of the sentence, or directly before the word/statement it is referring to. Fun Fact This construction is another example of how the も particle expresses that the word before it is surprising in some way, or unexpected. This was briefly discussed in the Number + も grammar point. Here we can see that も is highlighting 少 し as being 'surprising'. This is where the 'not even!' meaning comes from."

The other primary verb being 来 る . する means to do something, or to make something a certain way. する will almost always have the particle を attached to the thing that is being done (depending on the form of the verb). The reason that する verbs are called さ-column irregular conjugation verbs in Japanese is because the る in する does not conjugate, but is dropped. This will leave す to be the part that conjugates. Because of this, する has qualities of both る-Verbs (the る being dropped), and う-Verbs (the remaining す changing, depending on the conjugation). Here are some examples of how する changes. （さ）せる , （し）ます , （す）る , （せ）よ . We will learn more about each of these conjugations of する , and their individual meanings at a later stage. For now, let's take a look at the polite します conjugation. In a broader sense, する can be thought of as meaning 'to do something that has an external effect'."

It is interpreted as ‘(A) will definitely happen’, or ‘I will not fail to (A)’. This is a formal expression that literally means ‘I cannot leave it as it is with (A) undone’, and therefore indicates strong will to complete the action that is reflected in the standard translations. As this structure begins with ず, it will only be used with verbs. Alternatively, ないでは may replace ず. This will be seen as ないではおかない. However, the meaning will not change at all. Caution Due to this grammar expression showing strong will to not give up until (A) is done, it will often be used with causative verbs in (A). This indicates that the speaker is determined not to quit until they can make another person do something."

The case marking particle で will also regularly be seen after せい, especially when conveying the (B) result that occurred 'with' or 'by means of' those 'doings'. Fun Fact The 'doings' that 所為 represents is similar to the negative 'doings' that is used in English to place blame. This can be seen in phrases such as 'it was the weather's doings', or 'ah, so the missing cookies were your doings!'"

In this expression, も will be replaced with に. Also, apart from indicating that something is very unlikely, it may also indicate that something is showing 'no signs of (A)'. そうにない will connect to the ます-stem of the verb that it is indicating as being very unlikely. Occasionally, そうにもない may also appear, and has the strongest nuance of being unlikely to happen amongst そうにない , そうもない , and そうにもない . Note that the only difference between these three structures is the addition, subtraction, or combination of the に and も particles. As this structure is just an extension of the use of the auxiliary verb そう (used primarily for speculation, or hearsay), it is simply indicating that (A) does not have any appearance of occuring."

To use this structure, attach たい to the ます stem form of any verb, then replace the い in たい with がる . Caution たがる is in contrast to てほしい which means 'to want someone to do (A)'. These differences will need to be practiced, and memorized. This is also in contrast to the い-Adjective 欲 しい 'to want (A)'. To describe that someone seems like they want something (rather than that they want to 'do' something), がる will be paired with this adjective."

Fun-fact たちまち originally comes from the kanji structure 忽 ち , with the kanji itself meaning 'without thought'. This nuance is kept with たちまち , as all actions associated with the word indicate a lack of planning or thought before happening. Despite this, the kanji itself is rarely used in modern writing."

As 方 can be translated closely to 'way', or 'direction', this expression is suggesting that one specific choice is simply the better 'way'. This expression is quite direct, and can imply that there may be some sort of negative consequence if (A) is not done. In that respect, this phrase could also be translated as 'It would be better if you did (A)'. たほうがいい may also be used with the base (dictionary) form of a verb, but will sound more like a general opinion in those cases, rather than giving advice. Caution Because this phrase is quite direct, it would be better to use a more polite expression like ばいい , if giving general advice."

However, it is classified as a non-independent word in Japanese, and must always be connected to another word which illustrates the 'sake' that ため is highlighting. The case marking particle に will often be added after ため , to show that (A) is a goal that something will be done to reach. Due to this, ために can be translated as 'for the sake of (A)', or 'in order to (A)'. To use ために , attach it to the end of verb in its non-past form, or a noun follow by の. Fun Fact Despite mainly being used to highlight goals, or things dictating an action, ため is also sometimes used to highlight events that have already taken place, and their results. Due to this, a more accurate translation of ため (in all of its uses) is 'in light of (A)'. This simply highlights that (A) is the primary or major event/thing that resulted in (B), or will result in (B). When ため highlights past events, it is often translated simply as 'due to', or 'because of'."

(B) will always be something negative that is thought to inevitably occur once the action of (A) happens. These expressions may be translated as 'once (A), (B)', 'now that (A), (B)', or 'as soon as (A), (B)'. Both たら and が are being used as conjunction particles . たら carries its usual meaning of 'if' or 'when', while が has the meaning of 'however', or 'but'. This means that たが 最後 means '(A), but it will end up as (B)', while たら 最後 means 'when (A), in will end up as (B)'. Although this nuance is slightly different, they are used completely interchangeably. Because 最後 is primarily seen before the comma in these types of sentences, it can be easy to think that it is connected to the が or たら. However, it is actually more correctly connected logically to the (B) half of the sentence, and states that the 'final state' will end up being that way. Caution Occasionally, the (B) phrase will be omitted from these sentences when the negative result is obvious."

In these cases, (A) たる 者 will specifically mean 'a person in the position of (A)', and generally describes what is appropriate of that position. This use may be translated as 'for' or 'as'. Although this structure means 'to be' in the same way as である, the emphasis is far more on qualifications or expectations related to that position. Due to this, たる will not be used when simply stating that '(B) is (A)'.

Like most other grammar patterns that begin with だけ, this structure may be used with verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives followed by な, or nouns. Caution As だけあって emphasizes an innate or constant quality of (A), it will not be used for things that are not obvious, or have not yet happened. This means that だけあって will not appear in sentences discussing things that may happen in the future, and will also not often be utilized with phrases such as だろう, でしょう, かもしれない, or similar structures that express uncertainty."

This expression is often used in cases where the overall situation is negative, but it is still better than the alternative. This structure is a combination of the particle だけ 'only', and the な-Adjective 増 し, meaning 'better', or 'preferable'. Originally, まし is just the conjunctive form of 増 す, an う-Verb meaning to grow or increase (like 増 える). Due to this, the literal meaning is 'even just (A) is a plus, compared to what could have occured'. だけましだ will be used primarily after verbs, い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives followed by な. In the vast majority of cases, まし will simply be written in hiragana, or even katakana as マシ. The katakana version often further emphasizes that one should be grateful for (A). Caution - Although not as common, だけまだましだ may also be seen. As can be seen by the addition of まだ 'still', this form merely emphasized the point even further."

                        "content": "だって is a colloquial combination of the auxiliary verb だ , and the adverbial particle とて in Japanese (a combination of the particles と, and て). It has a wide range of uses, but primarily exclaims that something is the 'premise' for whatever has been said, or will be said next. This 'exclamation' is usually translated as 'I heard', 'cause', 'but', or 'even if'. The meaning that will be conveyed is determined primarily by where だって appears in a sentence. When placed at the beginning of a sentence, だって highlights the speaker's (usually) displeasure about something that has just been said, before following it with an explanation or counterpoint. This だって is quite similar to でも . At the end of a sentence, だって is used to express hearsay, in a similar way to 'I heard that', or 'it was said that', in English. In these cases it will be preceded by なん. なんだって always appears after a noun, or a phrase that has been nominalized (with の or こと). Caution When used directly after a noun, だって has a similar nuance to the だって that appears at the beginning of sentences (emphasizing what has come before it, in order to explain further). This comes across as でも , and may not be used with なん. Fun Fact The adverbial particle とて itself is an abbreviation of expressions like と 言 って, and と 思 って. だとて (the full construction) may also be used, but is almost always replaced by だって, as it is far easier to say. Fun Fact When used at the beginning of a sentence, もん or もの will often come at the end of that sentence, in order to strengthen the opinion given by the speaker. This is more commonly used by women and children."

Despite this, both ちゃんと and きちんと do have a slight nuance of doing something 'without dawdling'. This can mostly be attributed to the base meaning of 'properly' also implying that something is not done lazily."

This 'change' is often in regard to an increase, decrease, expansion, contraction, or something similar. This pattern can be translated simply as 'to be (A)ing'. Caution Compared to ている, つつある tends not to be used in relation to noticably physical motions, but rather highlights actions that indicate an ongoing state of change (such as the blooming of a flower), rather than simply 'continuing'. This is especially true for verbs that have an obvious end or completion point."

                        "content": "When joining the conjunction particle て , with the る-Verb あげる (to give), it implies that someone is doing something for the benefit of someone else. Literally, this expression means 'to give/bestow the action of (A) upon (B)', but translates more naturally as 'to do (A) for (B)', or 'to do (A) as a favor for (B)'. The receiver of the てあげる action will be marked with に , while the doer will be marked with が (if mentioned). Caution Unfortunately, てあげる can sound quite patronizing in modern Japanese, and should be avoided in situations where someone may take offence to having something done for them (for example, doing something for someone of higher status). This is primarily due to やる (a casual variation of 'to give') being phased out. Fun Fact Originally, やる was used when referring to giving water to plants, or feeding animals. However, some people started using あげる for these purposes as well, believing that it sounded 'nicer'. Historically, this actually achieved the opposite result, and some people began to think that あげる was insulting, as it was being used for plants/animals. These days, てやる is almost never used, unless you have a very close relationship with someone and are using it jokingly."

Sometimes ていた is used to express things that are still ongoing, but the speaker is not sure about, or would like to politely advise the listener about. This is very similar to the way in which English uses '(A) was doing (B)'. In this example, although the action of 'sitting' is not finished, we can imagine that the speaker is suggesting that 'dad was sitting here, and he still is, but he just went to get a drink'. The same kind of sentence could be used when the speaker has walked away from where their dad was sitting, and doesn't actually know if he is still sitting there or not."

In English, depending on the verb, this can be translated as 'is (A)', 'am (A), or 'are (A)~ing'. The expression is made by adding いる to the て form of either る-Verbs , or う-Verbs . Due to いる being one of the verbs for 'existing' in Japanese, the ている form means something closer to 'continuing to exist in a specific state', rather than (A)~ing in English. This is why verbs like 死 ぬ , and 知 る , appear as the ている form in Japanese, when they would appear as the past form in English."

To use this grammar point, you will need to attach て to any verb, and then follow it with くる . This nuance is usually that '(A) happened, and then came', or 'will happen, and then come'. In other words, it will depend on whether くる is in present, or past tense. てくる can be used when representing time, or when representing a physical place. When representing a physical place, it is more likely that the kanji structure, 来 る will be used. However, this is not a set rule, and depends on the writer. When used in relation to time, the nuance is usually that something has already come to pass, or will start to happen from now. This is the opposite of ていく , which indicates that something will change from the way that it is now, or will continue progressing in a certain way. Fun Fact When compared to English, てくる is very similar to the phrase 'to have come to (A)', in relation to time. This means that it focuses on the fact that the speaker will 'become (A)', should things continue in a specific way. In practice though, it is used like 'gotten' in most situations."

These meanings may seem quite different, but we will discuss their similarities in a moment. Let's look at a few examples of てしまう first. As we can see, verbs that usually take で instead of て will be no different when using てしまう . Sometimes, てしまう or でしまう will be shortened to a more casual form, which are often used in speech. These forms are as follows: てしまう will become ちゃう でしまう will become じゃう Fun Fact While て 終 う is most frequently written in hiragana, て 仕舞 う may also be seen. There is a slight nuance difference between these two kanji structures, but the primary meaning of しまう will always be that 'something has come to the point where ending/ending up in a specific state cannot be avoided'. This 'no turning back point' may be temporary (likely to be written as 仕舞 う) , or it may be permanent (likely to be written as 終 う ). Due to this 'cannot be avoided' nuance, しまう often comes across as 'totally', as in 'ah… I totally left the chicken in the oven for too long'. In these cases, it is simply expressing the speaker's exasperation that something is 'too late' to change. However, despite regularly being used negatively, てしまう can also be used positively. In these cases it still has the nuance of 'no turning back'."

Due to てでも expressing strong will, it will often be seen in sentences that include other phrases that mark desire or intent, such as ほしい, たい, and ようと 思 う. Fun-fact Although てでも is considered a fairly slang expression due to the use of てでも rather than the usual ても that would be expected of a verb, the construction itself of て-form partnered with an adverbial particle is quite common, and often marks emphasis or comparison.

This combines the conjunction particle て, the adverbial particle は, and the negative form of the う-Verb 叶 う ‘to grant (a wish)’, or ‘to realize (a goal)’. This may be interpreted as ‘it’s unbearable when (A)’, or ‘I can’t stand it when (A)’. However, the literal translation is ‘it’s not a dream come true for (A)’. When used following verbs, the (A) verb is often in the passive. This indicates that the speaker does not like being the target or victim of (A). However, standard verb structures may also be seen. In addition to this, てはかなわない may follow the conjunctive form of い-Adjectives, or appear as ではかなわない when following な-Adjectives. Caution Although many grammar structures frequently appear in hiragana, making their original kanji hard to identify, it will be important not to mix up 叶 う ‘to grant’ with 敵 う ‘to be a match for’. Grammatically, these verbs are both used quite differently."

The literal meaning of 'to not stop (A)', or 'to not desist (A)' is often translated as 'to always (A)', or 'to (A) from the bottom of one's heart'. It is an expression that is used exclusively in relation to feelings and emotions. Common words that may be partnered with やまない include 愛 'love', 敬愛 'love and respect', 願 う 'to wish for', 祈 る 'to hope for', 望 む 'to have ambitions for', 希望 'wish', 期待 'anticipation', 尊敬 'respect', 信 じる 'to trust', and several more. Either positive or negative emotions may be used. Caution As やまない emphasizes the continuation of something, てやまない will not be used with feelings that are temporary, such as (temporary) anger, or (temporary) disappointment."

Caution Although です is regularly attached to the end of い-Adjectives , some may actually consider this incorrect Japanese, and it should not be used in formal writing. In daily spoken language/texting, however, it is completely normal. The above example technically should not be used in formal writing.

It can be used to continue in the same topic, showing that '(B) is a result of (A)'. Or it may be used to change the conversation topic completely, showing that '(A) is at a good point to become (B)'. In each of these cases, it can be translated as 'and with that' in English.

These are particles that behave like a regular 助詞 (in that they appear after the words that they are referencing), but their role is a little bit more specific. でも itself has several uses, and the use that we will examine in this grammar point is called 例示 . Basically this means 'presenting examples'. In English, this results in a translation similar to 'even', or 'or something'. To use this structure, simply attach でも to the end of any noun , or pronoun . When grouped with a standard noun as above, でも is just showing that the noun is an example/suggestion, and that there are other choices/possibilities available. However, when the noun is a word like 誰 , どこ , 何 , or いつ, the translation becomes much closer to English words like 'anyone', 'anywhere', 'anything', or 'anytime'. Fun Fact There is debate among Japanese native speakers about whether でも should be considered its own word, or if it is actually just a combination of the particles で and も (or て and も in the case of verbs, but we will cover that later). As で and も together could be translated as 'even with (A)', it would also be correct to consider it this way. Caution When grouped with 何 , the pronunciation will almost always change to なん. This is purely to make なんでも easier to say."

At its core, it is always used to highlight something that is ' required ' to perform some sort of action. One of these uses relates to places, and translates roughly as 'at', or 'in' in English. In these sentences, the place is considered essential for the action to be performed, or the result of the action to be achieved. This is unlike the particle に , which marks the location itself as being the destination or target of an action. Basically, で means (A) 'place' allows (B) 'action' to occur. While に means (A) 'place' is the target for (B) 'action' occurring. In the first example, we can see that に marks the place that the person exists during an action, but the action itself is not dependent on the place. In the second example, the action is considered dependent on being at that place, as there are possibly no barbeques in other areas."

This phrase is often translated as 'I heard that', or 'it is said that', but literally, it is closer to 'it is that it's ~'. The だ is what gives this expression a high degree of certainty, therefore implying that the speaker has heard the statement elsewhere, and is sure of its validity. ということだ can be added to the end of any phrase that the speaker wants to highlight as being something that is known. ということだ is regularly paired with other expressions that show the 'source' of information, such as によると, or によれば . When ということだ is being used to express hearsay (statements that cannot easily be proven), it can be rephrased as とのことだ. The literal difference between these two phrases is as follows: ということだ - It can be explained that (A) is ~ (more emphasis on the information). とのことだ - The statement of (A) has been applied to ~ (more emphasis on the source that 'applied' the information). Caution ということだ is considered to be more formal than そうだ when reporting information that has been heard from another source. This is primarily due to ということだ expressing something that is thought to be a fact, while そうだ retains the nuance of being something that is a speculation/guess."

This may be thought of as similar to 'rather than saying (A), (B)' in English. というより may be used after any type of word. However, due to phrase that comes before it 'determining' something that will then be compared, nouns and な-Adjectives will require だ (despite being omitted in casual speech). だ may also be omitted if the sentence finishes with a だ that is describing the same thing in a different light. Caution It should be remembered that より (in all of its uses) will highlight something that is 'less'. This means that the (B) part of というより sentences will always describe something that is 'more', 'closer', 'more accurate', etc."

As this construction is just a combination of という 'to say', and ふうに 'in a manner', the literal meaning of this expression is similar to 'in a way that would say that (A)'. This simply highlights the speaker's uncertainty about what the actual situation is, and that they are only commenting on appearances. というふうに may be seen directly after verbs, or after nouns expressing the way in which something is being done. The (B) portion of these phrases will then indicate exactly what is being done 'in a way as if to say (A)'. Caution Because という often quotes the entire statement before it, it will be important to remember this when figuring out exactly what というふうに is emphasizing."

It may be translated as 'not just (A) or (B), but all', or '(A), (B) and everything else'. It is a combination of the case-marking particle と in its quotation use, the negative stem of 言 う, 言 わ, and the literary form of the classical auxiliary verb ぬ, ず. The literal translation is simply 'without saying (A), and without saying (B), (C)'. This 'without saying (A)' just means 'without limiting it to (A)'. This structure will follow both an (A) and a (B) noun before going on to explain what applies to everything. It will be important to remember that both (A) and (B) must be some part of a logical group when using this grammar structure, in order for it to sound natural. For example, the hands and the feet are part of the body, the morning and the afternoon are parts of a day, the chorus and the melody are parts of a song, etc. と 言 わず～と 言 わず is a fairly formal expression, and will rarely be used in everyday speech."

In its kanji form, とおり will be written as 通 り, and literally means 'street', or 'way'. However, it is regularly used to indicate the level of 'sameness' one thing has with another. This 'sameness' meaning appears when とおり is used as a suffix . とおり (or どおり) may be used with verbs or nouns. In the case of verbs, it is common to see it being used after both the plain form, and the simple-past form. Both どおり and のとおり may be used directly after nouns. However, とおり will only be used when the case marking particle の comes between the noun and とおり . While both of these structures may be used interchangeably, どおり is more common, especially in speech. Fun Fact Constructions like 言 った 通 り and その 通 り are used very frequently, simply as a polite way to agree with what has been said by another. In these cases, it translates similarly to 'that's exactly right', or 'that's it!'."

It is used to highlight that (A) was expected, but the unexpected result (B) occurred. It is usually translated as 'however', or 'despite that'. ところが is most often used at the beginning of a new sentence, before highlighting something that is contrary to what was described in the previous sentence. This use of が in Japanese is referred to as 確定 の 逆接 , which basically means 'a contradictory conclusion'. Caution Because ところが highlights a result that is unexpected, it can only be used for things that are beyond the control of the speaker. However, if the speaker is trying to do something, but assumes that their attempt may result in failure, ところが can be used to show that they were unexpectedly successful. Fun Fact Sometimes, ところが is referred to as a conjunction particle itself, disregarding the combination of ところ and が. This is similar to ところで, another conjunction particle that has a slightly different meaning, and is frequently translated as 'by the way'."

(A) will frequently highlight a person or organization in cases where the speaker is making an assumption from that standpoint.

In this way とみえる literally means 'from the way it appears, one can conclude that it's (A)'. However, this translates a bit more smoothly as 'it can be deduced that (A)', or 'it seems that (A)'. This expression is always used directly after the phrase that it is drawing as a conclusion. However, nouns and な-Adjectives will require だ before とみえる . While this phrase is conjecture (making a guess about something), it usually implies that the speaker has done some sort of research, or has some reason that led them to 'draw (A) as a conclusion'. Due to this, it appears reasonably confident. Fun Fact と always 'sums up' things. As a quotation , it sums up the phrase before it as either something that was said, or thought. As 一緒 'being together', it sums up groups of things that are existing/performing actions mutually. Lastly, as a result , it sums up causes, and then illustrates their effects."

Despite this, the meanings are often interchangeable, and it depends mostly on what type of word they are grouped with as to which type of particle it is. Common interpretations of とも in almost any situation are 'even if (A)', or 'no matter if (A)', and it will basically always simply highlight that 'in spite of (A), still (B)'. As a conjunction particle, とも will be paired with any words that are followed by the auxiliary verbs う, or よう, or after い-Adjectives in their conjunctive form. The adverbial particle usage only appears after い-Adjectives in their conjunctive form, and a select number of adverbs. It is recommended not to use this structure after adverbs unless you have already seen it used this way in native material."

Both と 同 じで and と 違 って will be preceded by a noun or noun phrase, before the (B) part of the sentence will describe the similarity/dissimilarity.

This phrase is often used to express a general idea about something that the speaker believes to be correct. と 言 える translates as 'it is fair to say (A)', or 'one could say (A)'. As the case marking particle と is being used in its 引用 (citation) use, と 言 える may follow any direct phrase/statement. と 言 える is regularly seen paired with grammar patterns like だろう , or でしょう . This makes the overall statement more friendly, by considering the listener's thoughts about the issue being presented. と 言 えるだろう can simply be translated as 'can we not say (A)?', or '(A) can be said, right?'. Caution When the potential form of 言 う is linked with the auxiliary verb よう, it creates a much stronger phrase that is similar to 'let it be said that (A)'. Fun Fact The speaker is usually relatively confident about their statement when using と 言 える, but the usage of a form that expresses conjecture shows that they are open to the possibility of being wrong, thus softening the tone."

In these cases, it is considered to be far stronger than ば , なら , or たら (which express hypothetical outcomes). This is because one of the primary uses of と is highlighting a result . In these cases, と is actually a conjunction particle , and shows one of three things. 仮定 の 順接 - A result that is assumed to be true, and obvious. 確定 の 順接 - A result that is known to be true. 仮定 の 逆接 - The opposite of a result that is assumed to be true. Due to this, the (B) part of a phrase using と as 'if', will always occur when (A) happens, as it is considered to be the result of (A). と may not be used in situations where the (B) result 'might' happen. It must be definite (or close to definite). In this particular nuance of と , despite being translated as 'if', the actual meaning is much closer to 'and', as と is expressing that (A) and (B) will always go together."

Usually, there is no way to stop (B) from happening, and it is considered a natural consequence of (A). In English, this translates closely with phrases like 'at any rate', or 'in any case'. Being an adverb, どうせ most often appears at the beginning of sentences, before going on to describe the inevitable situation. どうせ often carries the nuance of frustration or resignation that (A) cannot be changed. In these cases, it is often paired with other grammar structures such as なら or だから. This shows that if (A) cannot be changed, then (B) is a good idea. This usage translates similarly to 'if (A), you might as well (B)'. Fun-fact This grammar structure comes from a combination of どう 'how', and the imperative form of する, せよ. In this way, it is just emphasizing that no matter 'how (A) is done', the result cannot be changed."

                        "content": "どんどん (or ドンドン) is one of the countless words in Japanese that represent a particular sound or sensation. These words are known as onomatopoeia (オノマトペ in Japanese). どんどん represents the sound of banging (like on a drum), or the pounding of feet. In this way, it is regularly translated as 'rapidly', or 'quickly'. Like だんだん , どんどん may be used before almost any phrase. While どんどん can take the particle と , it is not required. In fact, と is very often omitted from adverbs/onomatopoeic words in Japanese. Caution Initially, it can be easy to mix-up どんどん , with だんだん . だんだん is used to express slower changes, and may be thought of as similar to 'steadily', or 'step by step' in English. Fun Fact When the と particle is used with onomatopoeic words, it is very similar to one of と 's main usages as a quotation marker in Japanese. This means that と has a similar role to words like 'went', or 'goes' in English. For example, In English, we would say: The door 'goes' BANG with the wind. However, the door doesn't actually 'go' anywhere. This is similar to what と is doing here."

This structure may literally be translated as something similar to 'not (A) is not all there is'. However, the common translations are '(A) is not impossible', or 'it doesn't mean that it isn't (A)'. This expression may be used with the ない form of any verb, い-Adjective , or な-Adjective . Let's have a look at a few examples before exploring the meaning further. By itself, ことはない highlights something that is unneeded, or never happens. This is partly due to the adverbial particle は expressing something as being 'complete'. In this way, 'there is no situation in which (A)', is quite an accurate translation of ことはない. By adding ない to the (A) verb, all ないことはない is doing is simply changing this nuance to 'there is -not- no situation in which (A)', a double negative expressing that (A) is actually possible. Fun Fact ないことはない often appears with verbs in the potential form. This usually implies a lack of effort, or feelings of half heartedness toward the completion of (A). It is similar to 'it's not like I can't (A)' in English."

The second is to request that someone 'not do (A)'. We will examine the first in this write-up. ないで is a combination of the auxiliary verb ない, and the particle で . Due to this, で keeps its standard meaning of 'with/by', in relation to 'not' doing something. When ないで is used to express that '(A) has not been done before doing (B)', this is usually contrary to some kind of expectation. Because of this, ないで is often used to express something that may be surprising to the listener. Caution Be careful of the following two structures: (A) ないで (B) - Without doing (A), (B). (A) なくて (B) - Without doing (A), (B). Technically, these two constructions share a similar meaning. However, in modern Japanese ないで is used more frequently when the (B) action is being highlighted as being done without (A). On the other hand, なくて is used when (A) is being given as a reason for why something else was/wasn't done."

As this is a combination of the negated form of a verb, 訳 'reason', or 'logic', に, は, and the negated form of 行 く, the literal meaning is just 'there's no reason that (A) can't be done', or 'it cannot be so that (A) won't be done'. Compared to other similar structures like なければならない, ないといけない, and various others, ない 訳 にはいかない implies that there are some circumstances as to why (A) cannot be avoided, so will often be used when giving an excuse or reasoning as to why one must do (A)."

However, this is where the similarities end. なくてはいけない is an example of a double negative in Japanese, and actually has the meaning '(A) must be done', or 'must do (A)'. While this grammar point is usually translated as 'must do', the literal translation is 'must not, not do (A)'. This double 'not' is where many learners have difficulties. いけない simply means 'cannot go', and comes from the negative potential form of 行 く. To use this structure, simply create the negative form of a verb, and then convert ない to なく (the conjunctive form of an い-Adjective ), followed by て . After this, は is added, and then finally いけない . いけない is considered to be the most common structure used with the 'must', and 'must not' grammar points, and is natural in both speech, and written Japanese. Alternatively, ならない may be used in formal speech, but is much better suited to writing. だめ is also acceptable, but much more casual than either いけない or ならない . Caution The ては in なくては is often converted to ちゃ, as this is easier to say. なくちゃ may then be followed by いけない , or いけない may be omitted, without changing the meaning. These casual structures are very similar to words like 'gotta' in English."

This results in the same 'and' meaning as the standard て form, but with the negative meaning of ない. なくて is often used when the phrase that comes before it is being highlighted as an example/reason for a specific result. In these situations, the translation is usually 'because not (A), (B)', or 'because I didn't (A), (B)'. When なくて is used in this way, it is often followed by the speaker's feelings (in the form of an adjective), verbs in the potential form, or something that is generally beyond the control of the speaker. It is due to this fact that the result is 'beyond control' that the translation becomes 'because'. Some examples of words that express things beyond the control of the speaker are 困 る (to be troubled), 嬉 しい (to be happy), 疲 れている (to feel weary), 心配 (to feel anxiety/worry), 安心 (to feel relief)."

To use なさい , simply connect it to the ます stem of any verb. なさい may be shortened further to な, which becomes an even more casual form that is used most frequently toward peers. Caution Be careful not to get confused between な (the particle), and な (the shortened form of なさい ).

In this way, it is regularly translated as 'such as', 'things like', or 'and so on'. など may be used after nouns, to describe that (A) is being presented as an example from within a group. Alternatively, など can be followed by の (B), to show that (A) is only one type of thing from the broader category, (B). など is regularly seen in its kanji form, 等 . This kanji itself has a similar meaning to 'etc' in English. Fun Fact The kanji for 等 is also used in the pluralizing suffix, ら . Due to this, we can see that this kanji is regularly utilized to highlight something that exists as part of a larger group. In the first sentence, など presents (A) as being part of a larger group of similar things. This is exactly the same thing that happens in the second sentence with ら . Fun Fact など is also sometimes written as なんか , and has an interchangeable meaning in many situations. However, なんか will never use the kanji form of 等 ."

                        "content": "ならいざ 知 らず is a grammar expression which combines the hypothetical form of the auxiliary verb だ, なら, the adverb いざ ‘now’, or ‘well then’, and the classically-negated form of the う-Verb 知 る, 知 らず ‘to not know’. It is often translated as ‘I don’t know about (A), but (B)’, or ‘maybe (A), but (B). This phrase is formal, and usually used to emphasize that, regardless of (A), (B) fits a specific description. ならいざ 知 らず will follow verbs in their standard forms . Additionally, it may follow either な-Adjectives or nouns that have had their terminal だ replaced with なら. Just like the literal translation of ‘if it’s (A), well then I don’t know’, this structure emphasizes that (A) may or may not be the case, but (B) is definite. However, there is no direct use of ‘but’ in Japanese. This shows that the ‘but’ comes from the simple contrast of (A) being unknown while (B) is known. ならいざ 知 らず may also be seen following other structures such as い-Adjectives when they have been nominalized with の. This の pattern is also used with verbs, but it is less common than simply attaching ならいざしらず to one of the standard verb forms. Fun Fact In many cases, (A) is an extreme example used to show that (B) is the opposite of that, and is therefore either surprising or irritating. Caution Occasionally は will be used instead of なら. However, the meaning of the overall phrase will remain the same."

This use can be translated as 'for (A) do to (C) in the way of (B)'. Or more simply, 'to do its best in its own way', or 'to do as much as one can'. This use stems from 形 , meaning 'shape' or 'pattern', and can be thought of as meaning 'in the pattern of'. In these sentences, (A) will be a specific example from within a group, (B) will be representative of the whole group, and (C), will be the trait or behavior in question related to (B). Either of the case marking particle s に or の will come after なり, depending on whether なり is linked directly to a noun, or is being used adverbially. なりに and なりの may follow almost any word in its plain form , with the word it follows being the group or quality that is being represented. This use of なり is considered a neologism, which is a pre-existing word that has been adapted to have a new meaning or nuance. When used this way, なり will almost always express that (A) is not doing something adequately or as desired, but is doing the best it can based on the 'pattern' or 'mold' that it comes from."

Literally, the meaning is much closer to 'what + counter + I wonder?', as it shows the speaker's uncertainty about the number. In addition to なん; いく, from the kanji 幾 (how many/much) may be used as part of this construction. While both are fairly common, 幾 is more common as part of set expressions, like 幾 ら (how much) and 幾 つ (how many/old), while なん is more common for counting specific things, like people. Both 何 and 幾 are regularly seen in plain hiragana and their kanji forms, so it is worth remembering both. Caution Despite having the same kanji as 何 , なん will almost always be used to count things, while なに will be used to identify things."

                        "content": "にかかっている is a structure that may be translated as 'to depend on (A)', or 'to rest on (A)'. It is a combination of the case marking particle に, and the ている continuous form of 懸 かる 'to depend'. Although にかかっている may attach to nouns, it is also frequently seen following set structures such as かどうか 'whether or not', and か 否 か 'yes or no'. The に in にかかっている may sometimes be replaced with the adverb 如何 に 'how', 'in what way', or 'to what extent. In these situations, the meaning stays relatively the same, but will extend to 'depending on the way in which (A)', or 'depending on to what extent (A)'. Fun Fact 懸 かる is from the same family of verbs as 掛 かる, 架 かる, and 罹 る. These all have a similar meaning, but with a slightly different nuance. Japanese has many verbs like this that have the same reading, but with a nuance that changes based on the kanji. Due to kanji not always being used for many of these, it will be important to be able to recognize which nuance is being used in any given situation."

This grammar structure is a combination of the case marking particle に , and 掛 ける combined with the conjunction particle て. Literally, the meaning can be thought of as follows: に - Marks (A) as the location/state. 掛 けて - States that something is 'suspended' (in an ongoing process) in that location/state. The 'something' that is an ongoing process will usually be indicated by a (B) part of the sentence. This expression will primarily be used with nouns. にかけて is primarily used in written language, although it appears quite often in the news as well, indicating that some weather pattern is expected to continue for a set period of time. Caution Occasionally, the adverbial particle は is used after にかけて. This transforms the meaning of 'all through (A)', to something similar to 'limited to within (A)'. Any (B) phrase in these types of sentences will be contrasting (B) with (A), rather than saying (B) is occurring within (A). As we can see by these examples, this is an extension of the standard use of は, which shows that everything before it is a 'set state'. Therefore '(A) は (B)', means that 'only (A) defines (A), (B) is a separate entity/discussion'."

It will often be translated as 'from the point of view of (A), (B)', 'in the case of (A), (B)', or simply 'for (A), (B)'. Literally, the meaning is 'assuming that I was (A) and then looking from there, (B)'. にしてみれば will appear after nouns that represent a person, or organizations representative of people. It is a combination of the case-marking particle に, the て-form of する, and the hypothetical form of 見 る, 見 れば. As にしてみれば will exclusively follow words that indicate a person or a group of people, the (B) part of the phrase will usually discuss how the speaker assumes that they would feel given the situation. Because of this assumption, these sentences often finish with だろう, でしょう, かもしれない, and other similar structures."

This will be translated as '(A) as well as (B)', 'both (A) and (B)', or 'to be (A) and (B)'. This use of にして will appear following either nouns or な-Adjectives. Some set expressions like 幸 いにして and 不幸 にして also exist. These can be interpreted as 'fortunately' and 'unfortunately' respectively. Caution Like with 幸 いにして and 不幸 にして , にして tends to be used with a fairly limited set of words when having the meaning of 'both (A) and (B)'. Due to this, it is best to only use patterns that you have come across before. Fun Fact The tense at the end of にして sentences often changes the way that it will be understood, but it is important to remember that all にして structures simply put emphasis on (A) as being what allowed (B), led to (B), or exists in precedence to (B)."

                        "content": "にする is a structure that combines the に particle (a location/target), with the verb する . It means to 'make/decide' something in a certain way. The nuance with にする is that the speaker has direct control over the outcome. This is where the strong feeling of 'choice' comes from. The noun that comes before にする is the thing that is being decided. In this example, although the common translation is 'to decide', it is actually much closer to the slang expression 'to do (A)' in English. This means that the literal translation is actually 'I'll do a beer', or 'I'll make it a beer'. Sometimes the particle と is used instead of に. Although this has the same meaning, it changes the nuance slightly. When と is used, it takes away the feeling of being a direct decision. とする tends to be used in more formal situations, but this is only because と is less 'definite', so results in the phrase sounding less pushy. If you were going to compare these two to an English equivalent, it would be similar to the difference between the following sentences. に - I'll buy a burger. (A burger is the direct target of 'buy') と - I'll go with a burger. (You aren't 'going' anywhere, it just sounds softer) This grammar point may be used for more abstract nouns, and does not specifically need to be 'items'."

However, unlike に 就 き this structure is a combination of に and the conjunctive form of the る-Verb 付 ける 'to affix', or 'to adhere'. When using につけ , the most common translation will be that something is happening 'every (A)', or 'whenever (A)'. In the (B) part of the sentence, the thoughts or feelings of the speaker will often be expressed in relation to (A). Additionally, (B) will always be something that is thought to happen naturally due to (A). This structure may appear with either verbs or nouns in their dictionary forms. It is also possible to see につけて , but the abbreviated form is far more common. Caution This is considered a fairly old-fashioned grammar structure, so will mostly only be seen in literature or shows that are emphasizing a specific time period."

It can even be used with negative forms, to show that something 'will not become (A)'.

                        "content": "にみえる (primarily written only in hiragana) is a phrase that combines the case marking particle に , with the る-Verb 見 える 'to appear', or 'to be visible'. This construction is regularly used with nouns, to show that something 'appears to be (A)', but it may also be partnered with the auxiliary verbs ようだ or そうだ (in their adverbial forms ように and そうに ) to add a level of uncertainty. In these cases, it sounds closer to 'to seem to be (A)' in English. As with many other ようだ structures, みたい may be used instead. This creates the expression みたい にみえる . While this may appear confusing at first, it just means 'to look like something that could be (A)'. In this way it reinforces the 'guess' that the speaker is making. Caution In grammar constructions like this, kanji will very rarely be used. This is primarily because it will change the way a native speaker perceives the meaning. Many grammar structures are written purely in hiragana, specifically to express that they are a 'set' construction. Adding kanji can lead a reader to assume that the writer is highlighting the kanji's meaning, rather than the more common grammatical meaning."

It is a combination of the case-marking particle に, and the conjunctive form of the る-verb 先駆 ける, meaning ‘to lead the attack’, or ‘to pioneer’. In most cases, 先駆 け will imply that one person or organization did something first, which then led to everyone else within the same category taking the same course of action. Common translations include ‘prior to (A), (B)’, or ‘ahead of (A), (B)’. Occasionally, the conjunction particle て may be used after the base 先駆 け form. As this grammar structure often indicates whole bodies that took a similar action after (B), に 先駆 け will usually be seen after words like 世界 ‘the world’, 全国 ‘the whole country’, 全市 ‘the whole city’ or ‘every city’, 業界 ‘the industry’, 他社 ‘other companies’, or 他 ◯ ‘or anything’."

It is a mix of the case-marking particle に, and the negatived form of the る-Verb 堪 える ‘to tolerate’, 堪 えない. In this meaning, に 堪 えない will be used following verbs. This is in contrast to the に 堪 えない grammar point that follows nouns, and means ‘to be very (A)’, but is more literally ‘to be so (A) I can’t stand it’. Although 堪 える will be used more often than other kanji that have the same reading and similar meanings, this is not always the case. Occasionally 耐 える ‘to withstand’ will be used when the emphasis is on the ability to endure (A), while 絶 える ‘to discontinue’, or ‘to peter out’ will be used when the emphasis is on not being able to suppress (A). For 絶 える, this is especially used in the case of strong feelings. Caution The affirmative form of に 堪 える may also be used to express that something is ‘worth doing’. A closer interpretation of this would be similar to an English phrase like ‘to be passable for (A)’. Rather than meaning that something is particularly suitable, it just highlights that it also acceptably falls in the category of (A), despite not being intended for it, or perhaps not expected."

It is usually translated as 'if you ask (A), (B)', or 'according to (A), (B)'. The literal meaning is 'if (A) is allowed to speak, (B)', as this pattern is just a combination of the case-marking particle に, the う-Verb 言 う 'to say' followed by the hypothetical form of the auxiliary verb せる, せれ 'to allow to do', and the conjunction particle ば. To use this structure, simply attach it to the end of a noun marking the person or group whose opinion is being given. Other hypothetical structures such as と and たら may also be used, but ば is the most common. Additionally, this pattern may sound self-important, so is best used sparingly, especially when giving your own opinions. Occasionally, から will be used instead of に. Caution With the auxiliary verbs せる and させる, it will be important to remember that に tends to be mark the doer when they are being allowed to do something, as in this case, while を will be used more frequently when the doer is being made to do something."

This means that it can be utilized to describe how often something happens/is done.

In this way, に keeps its regular nuance of being a 'goal', or 'destination', within which something else takes place. Caution This use of に should not be confused with で in relation to time. When で is used for 'time', it is expressing the amount of time that is required to do something, or how much time something is expected to take. It is not used for frequency. Due to this, you can think of に as marking a portion (or portions) of time inside of a larger space of time, within which something happens. However, で marks a whole space of time, within which something can be/is completed."

Due to this, it is often translated as 'right?', or 'isn't it?'. To use ね , simply add it to the end of almost any sentence. As we will cover in our lesson about the sentence ending particle な , ね can almost be thought of as the opposite. ね is used when expressing a shared opinion, a shared thought, or generally something you think will be agreed with by the listener. However, な focuses almost exclusively on the speaker, and their own thoughts. Fun Fact よ and ね are very frequently combined together to make the sentence ender よ ね . This is used purely when you expect the listener will agree with you. Caution ね is much weaker than でしょう or だろう , and is sometimes said purely out of habit, without much nuance of 'right' at all."

This is done through the use of の , or なの (in the case of な-Adjectives and nouns). Despite the grammatical rule relating to nominalization using の (or なの ), this part of the phrase is often omitted. だろうか is quite masculine, so in order to sound more polite/ladylike, でしょうか may also be used instead. Caution Although だろうか is quite masculine, it does not strictly mean that でしょうか is feminine. でしょうか may be used confidently by either women or men. Fun Fact Like だろう , だろうか may be used to ask a question, or simply to express the speaker's inner thoughts. However, だろうか is most commonly used to express a personal 'I wonder', in a similar way to かな . Because of this, even if it is used as a question, the listener may assume that you are not specifically looking for an answer from them."

In English, this can either mean 'that which', or 'the one who/that'. This construction can be used after verbs in any tense, except for the polite ます or ません, which are only used at the end of a sentence, or certain clauses. Caution の cannot be used as a substitute for こと in set expressions like ことができる , or ことがある .

In the first sentence, we can see that の is showing ownership, however in the second sentence, it is simply showing a relationship between (A) and (B). の is also often used in the same way as が , to highlight the subject of a statement. Our lesson for が will be covered separately. Both of these examples are slightly advanced and use adjectives, but don't worry, we will be covering them next! Caution の is usually used after nouns, but can also be used after other types of words, specifically when it is transforming them into a noun-like phrase. This is called nominalization in English. We will cover this in detail in the の - Nominalization grammar point."

In this expression, the adverbial particle は presents (A) as being a stand-alone topic, before the adverb もちろん 'naturally' emphasizes that (A) is what it is. After this, the (B) part of the sentence will describe some other factor that is worth mentioning. はもちろん will be used directly after noun (A), before the sentence will go on to discuss noun (B). This construction can be translated as 'not only (A), but (B)', 'not to mention (A), (B)', and other similar English expressions. In many cases, despite (A) being the obvious factor, (B) is being highlighted as sharing similar qualities to (A). This means that in はもちろん sentences, も will almost always be seen after (B). Caution While quite similar in meaning to だけでなく , はもちろん is quite a bit more formal. Due to this, it may sound quite stiff in friendly conversation, unless particularly emphasizing something."

However, が primarily marks single actions or statements. We will explore this distinction in more detail when covering が . In many sentences (especially short ones), either は or が would be considered perfectly natural. This depends on whether someone is simply stating something ( は ), or highlighting it especially ( が ). In the first sentence, は broadly describes what the sentence is about (curry). In the second sentence, は again describes the whole sentence being about 'me', but が highlights one specific piece of information (wine being the thing that is hated). Caution は cannot be used to describe things that you are seeing or experiencing 'in the moment' (right now). This is due to 'in the moment' events being considered part of a larger experience (your whole day for example). Caution は has 2 main functions. The first marks the topic of the sentence, the second is used for contrast or making comparisons. Although there are no 'strict' rules for this, when は is used toward (or after) the middle of a sentence, it will usually have the nuance of contrast. In the second sentence, は will give the listener the impression that there is a comparison being made."

This construction is often translated to 'I wish I did (A)', or 'I should have done (A)'. ばよかった is used after verbs, so requires the standard ば conjugation, before adding よかった . As ば highlights hypothetical situations, ばよかった literally means that 'it would have been good if (A)', where (A) is the thing that the speaker wishes had happened.

It is a る-Verb, and may be translated as '(A) looking', '(A) seeming', or 'behaving like (A)'. びる is quite formal, and will follow a limited set of expressions. びる will appear after nouns, or occasionally the stem form of い-Adjectives. びる indicates that, according to the speaker, something 'gives off the sense of (A)', and is based on visual information. As it is a descriptive verb, びる will change to びた when linked directly to a second noun. Fun Fact Both びる and めく can be thought of as similar to さ, the structure that pairs with adjectives to create new nouns indicating an extent. This is due to the fact that when びる or めく attach to a word, they turn that word itself into a verb that expresses 'having the feeling of (A)', or 'having gained the feeling of (A)' when used in past tense."

It implies some sort of moral obligation, or that (A) is the only reasonable course of action. This comes from the kanji 可 き, which carries the meaning of being something 'permissible' (indicating that any other action would not be acceptable). べき will be paired with the plain (non-past) form of a verb, before being followed by either だ , or another noun. べき is also sometimes translated as 'must do (A)', or 'should do (A)' but it is important to remember that it will always have the nuance of being the only 'permissible' choice, and is therefore very strong. Caution It is important to note that the verb appearing with べき cannot be in past tense, and you will need to use だった or でした after べき , if you would like to say that something 'ought to have been done' in the past. Fun Fact In modern Japanese, there are only 18 auxiliary verbs , of which べき is not one. べし (the standard form) is considered to be a classical auxiliary verb . Due to this, べき (and べし) are often referred to as classical auxiliary verbs . Fun Fact The combination of する and べき is a rare grammatical exception in Japanese, in which two forms are both considered equally correct. Due to this, either するべき, or すべき may be used."

Basically, 他 by itself just means 'another', or 'other'. に highlights 他 'another thing' as being the target of what comes next in any particular sentence. The possibilities are as follows: 他 に - Another thing. 他 に （ も ） - Even another thing (sounds less certain). 他 に （ は ） - Was there another thing (focuses on something pre-existing, which someone may have forgotten). 他 の + Noun - Another 'specific thing'. 他 に （ は ） may be used in either positive or negative sentences, but it tends to appear in negative sentences more often. Caution Because 他 に （ も ） focuses on the 'addition' of another thing, it cannot be used in negative sentences (with the exception of questions). The reason this is acceptable in questions, but not statements, is due to the 'isn't it?' meaning that negative questions can have in Japanese (just like English). It is the equivalent of the following: この 他 にも ない - In addition to this, there is also nothing (sounds strange in English!) その 他 にも ないか - In addition to that, is there nothing else?

(A) being a word that expresses some kind of measurement (usually time). まい～のように is often translated as 'almost every (A)', 'nearly every (A)', or 'on an (A) basis'. Because よう (from the kanji 様 ) usually expresses the 'manner' in which something is existing/happening, this phrase literally highlights that something occurs 'in the manner of every (A)', and is therefore up to the interpretation of the listener as to whether the speaker means 'every', or 'almost every'. Caution Although みたいに and のように are regularly interchangeable, that is not the case with まい～のように . This is because みたいだ is originally an abbreviation of the more formal phrase を 見た ような , and therefore can sound unnatural when used to describe things that cannot be seen, like time."

In modern Japanese, まさか is thought of as a single adverb meaning 'it can't be true', 'no way', or 'don't tell me'. As it is treated primarily as an adverb, まさか will most often appear at the beginning of a sentence, before some statement about what the speaker is shocked/surprised about. Fun Fact まさ comes from 正 , meaning 'precise' or 'actual'. However, this noun is very rarely used in modern Japanese. まさに is an adverb used to mean 'precisely', while まさか is another adverb used to mean 'no way!'. However, the literal meaning of まさか is closer to 'is it true?', or 'is it actually?', due to か's role in creating questions."

However, unlike our first look at まで , which discussed its use as 'until', this use of まで has the nuance of 'even', or 'to the extent'. It can be used after verbs or nouns. Although using まで as 'even' may seem different to 'until', they are essentially the same thing in Japanese. This is because まで always means '(A) まで , (B)', where (A) is the 'limitation/extent', and (B) is the 'noteworthy factor'. This 'noteworthy factor' will usually be a descriptive word/phrase, such as a verb, adjective, or explanation. Fun Fact The も particle is sometimes grouped together with まで , when the meaning is 'even'. This just adds emphasis to the fact that the event is somewhat surprising, or that the result is satisfying."

In each of these cases, it will carry the meaning of 'like (A)', or 'resembling (A)'. The difference between みたい describing a verb or a noun can be identified by whether it is followed by な (describes a noun), or に (describes a verb). Let's take a look at some examples. This difference is important to know, as (B), the thing that みたい is describing, does not always come directly after みたい . In the second example sentence, we can see that 泳 ぐ (the verb that に is linked to), does not actually come until later in the sentence. This is quite a regular occurrence, especially in longer passages. Caution Despite みたい meaning 'to resemble', and being based on (usually) visual stimulus, it should not be confused with 見 たい 'to want to see'. This is a common mistake that learners make, as みたい itself does not have a kanji form."

This is due to its meaning of 'to show signs of (A)', or 'to have the appearance of (A)'. It will be attached to nouns that the speaker experiences to be the case. As めく itself is a verb, it may appear in several different conjugation forms depending on how it is describing the rest of the sentence. When connected directly to a second noun, the past-tense form めいた is most common. This 'that the speaker experiences to be the case' part is important, as めく will almost always highlight the speaker's own personal feelings in regard to (A), and how they perceive it. The thing being described as (A) will usually not actually be (A), and the speaker is often aware of this fact. Caution めく is mostly used with set nouns, so it is best to only use it with expressions that you have already heard. Some examples are 謎 めく 'to appear to be a riddle', 皮肉 めく 'to appear to be sarcastic', 言 い 訳 めく 'to appear to be an excuse', 作 り 物 めく 'to appear to be fictitious', and seasons of the year."

This expression is a combination of the adverbial particle も, the pre-noun adjectival さる 'particular', or 'certain', the noun 事 'thing', and the conjunction particle ながら 'while'. Due to this, the more literal translation is simply 'while (A) is also of particular merit, (B)'. This literal translation will be helpful to remember, as もさることながら will always present (A) as important, but (B) as even more important than that. もさることながら will be attached to the end of nouns and noun phrases. As (B) is being emphasized in sentences that use this grammar structure, it is common to see other expressions of emphasis combined with もさることながら . Some examples include さらに 'additionally', なにより 'more than anything', and 以上 'above that'."

Due to もっとも offering clarification about something, the (B) phrase will often end with が, けど, けれども , and other similar expressions. When もっとも is used, the speaker is agreeing that (A) is true, but not the whole picture. As a noun itself, 尤 も can be described as 道理に 適 う, which means 'to stand to reason'. This nuance is kept, and may also be used as an accurate translation for もっとも as a conjunction."

This just means a noun that is used in a similar way to 'thing' in English. もの regularly refers to things that do not have their own name, or are difficult to name due to their complexity. When もの is combined with the auxiliary verb だ , it implies that the previously mentioned (A) is something that 'is what it is'. This is often used in relation to customs, conventions, common sense, or to highlight results that would naturally be expected in any given situation. To use ものだ, attach it to the end of the attributive form of any word/word that ends a phrase that you would like to highlight as being an obvious piece of information. ものだ as 'supposed to', or 'the way it is' can also be used to negate a phrase, and say that it is 'something that isn't expected', or 'shouldn't be the case'. To do this, だ will be replaced with ではない, or じゃない. Caution もの may sometimes be abbreviated as もん. This is far more common in spoken language, and can make the statement sound a bit more casual overall."

Sometimes, やすい has a translation that is a bit closer to 'prone to (A)', or 'likely to (A)' in English. This nuance is regularly seen when the verb is related to emotions. Caution There is another adjective 安 い that has the meaning of 'cheap'. This kanji should never be used with verbs to mean 'easy'. Most of the time, やすい itself will be written in hiragana, and usage of 易 い is quite limited. Fun Fact Although 易 い is an い-Adjective , it is almost never used by itself (when not attached to verbs). In such cases, it is much more natural to use the な-Adjective 簡単 ."

Remembering that う and よう can have one of three possible meanings in Japanese (as discussed in the よう grammar point), ようと 思 う is usually only used to express one of those three. That 'one' is as follows: 意志 - Expresses intentions (has a similar meaning to ～するつもりだ ）. This expression is also often used with 思 っている . In these cases, it highlights that the intention of the speaker is something that they regularly think, or have been thinking about for some time. 思 っている may also be used when describing the intentions of another person, as discussed in our lesson about と 思 う . Caution Let's be careful to remember the difference between the auxiliary verbs よう , and ようだ . They are different constructions that have different meanings, and behave in unique ways grammatically."

As ようだ is being linked to the verb する , it will take on its adverbial form, ように . This structure emphasizes that the (A) action (always a verb) is something that the speaker is going out of their way to do, and implies effort. Naturally, this structure may also be used with a negative verb, to imply that (A) being done is something that is actively being avoided. This translates as 'to make sure not to do (A)'. Fun Fact Because ようだ comes from the kanji 様 'manner', it carries the nuance that the 'way' that someone is doing (A) is specifically in a way that has success as the goal. Literally it translates quite closely to 'to do (A) in the manner of getting it done', and therefore just strengthens the (A) action, by using 'to do' twice."

When preceded by a verb in its dictionary form, it just conveys that 'there is no choice but (A)', or that '(A) cannot be helped'. Occasionally the が will be dropped, between 仕方 and ない. Keeping almost exactly the same style of translation is a similar pattern, より 他 にない . The only actual difference is that this structure expresses that there is no 'other' alternative, rather than being no 'method'. The noun 他 'other' and に will simply replace 仕方 'method' and が. As with 仕方 が, the に will often be dropped in 他 に. Both よりしかたがない and よりほかにない have a tendency to express some particular evaluation of (A) that cannot be helped or denied, or simply that 'given the situation, (A) cannot be avoided'."

Like most sentence ending particles, it is simply added to the end of almost any sentence. Despite the standard use of よ being to convey new information, it is also very regularly paired with ね , to convey the meaning of 'right?!'. This more literally means something closer to 'I think (A), and I bet you think (A) too!'. Caution Did you notice that there is a だ after the noun, but not the い-Adjective ? This is not a unique rule for よ , but just one of the regular conjugation rules introduced in the lessons for い-Adjectives and な-Adjectives . It is also acceptable to use です よ after either type of adjective (or noun)."

Both ない and ません are auxiliary verbs ( ません is a conjugation of ます), meaning that they have their own set of conjugation rules.

It can be translated as 'cannot afford to (A)', or 'impossible to (A)'. However, the literal meaning is much closer to 'it cannot be so that (A)'. This structure will be used directly after the non-past form of verbs, in order to highlight them as being either highly undesirable, or highly unattainable. Although わけにはいかない primarily highlights things that are undesirable, it may also highlight something that is desirable, but impossible for some reason. This will depend largely on the speaker's tone of voice, and context of the conversation. In these types of sentences, the expression is quite similar to the 'I guess it's just not meant to be so' nuance that can be conveyed in English, highlighting regret."

When appearing after the dictionary form of a verb that is being repeated, it highlights a large amount, something happening successively, or more and more. It will often be translated as 'more and more (A)', '(A) keeps on happening', or 'so much (A)'. わ～わ may be used either positively or negatively. To use this structure, simply place わ after the verb, and then repeat the same verb with a second わ . わ～わ primarily emphasizes the speaker's surprise in regard to the amount or extent of (A). This structure is predominantly used by men, but it may also sometimes be used by women. However, there are several different variations of わ depending on where they appear in sentences, each of which have gender usage tendencies that will need to be learned. In many cases where a する verb is being used with わ～わ , the second instance of the action will be omitted, with する appearing by itself. For example, instead of 勉強 する わ 勉強 する わ , 勉強 する わ する わ would be used. Fun Fact わ is simply an emphatic version of the usual は adverbial particle , and originates from は being changed to わ . Due to this, the literal meaning can be thought of as a stronger version of the standard 'as for (A)' meaning of は. This would come across something like 'as for (A), it did (A)', with the repetition itself adding to the emphasis."

                        "content": "When used with time related expressions, the structure をもって is often translated as 'as of (A)', or 'effective from (A)'. This grammar pattern is a construction of the adverbial particle を, and もって 'by means of'. をもって will be used after nouns that indicate a time, or an event that happens at a specific time. As is frequently seen in polite speech or in official notifications, をもって may sometimes be read as をもちまして . Alternatively, the small っ (called a 促音 ) may occasionally be dropped. This results in をもて. Caution Although 'effective from' can have the nuance of 'starting' in English, をもって primarily focuses on something ending, or what has happened up until the end date specified. Due to this, it will not be used to indicate that something is starting from a date that had nothing significant happen before it. Fun Fact Coming from the kanji 以 て, and specifically meaning 'by means of', もって originally derives its nuance from 持 って, 'to hold', or 'to have'. In this way, it may help to remember もって as working in a similar way to 'having (A)', or 'having reached (A)' in English."

The case marking particle に just marks '(A) を 中心 に ' as the target that is being focused on. Due to 中心 itself marking a 'central point', it may also be used just to express the middle of something, rather than something that is being concentrated or focused on. By adding する in either its dictionary or past forms, を 中心 にする or を 中心 にした may appear before another noun. This will highlight the noun that comes after as being the overall thing through which the 'focus on (A)' is taking place. Additionally, the case-marking particle と may sometimes replace に. This change will put more nuance on the focus point being conclusive, rather than progressive or decisive."

The adverbial particle を will mark a noun which will be considered the secondary event or state, while 兼 ねて will be followed by the primary event or state that will be done concurrently with (A). This is often translated as 'to (A) at the same time as (B)', 'to double as (A)', or 'to (A) also partly for the purpose of (B)'. を 兼 ねて often highlights (B) as the primary goal, where (A) is something that acts to support it, makes sense to be done together, or just gives the speaker a good excuse to do (B). In order to remember that (A) is actually the secondary goal in this structure, using the literal translation of 'while extending across to (A), (B)' may help. In the case of multiple goals existing, the case-marking particle と will be used for listing of nouns."

This grammar point can be translated as 'concerning (A)', 'in regard to (A)', or 'about (A)'. However, following the most natural translation, we can see that 'to go around the topic of (A)', or 'encompassing (A)' are also acceptable. Caution In addition to being quite formal, を 巡 って keeps the 'around the topic of (A)' nuance that comes from the stem verb. This means that rather than expressing one opinion, it takes into consideration many different viewpoints, and is frequently used when there is a disagreement or dispute about (A). Because of this, it can sound quite unnatural to use を 巡 って if the topic of (A) is simply a personal opinion."

Common interpretations include ‘ending with (A), (B)’, and ‘no longer than (A), (B)’. This grammar pattern makes use of the adverbial particle を, the noun 限 り ‘limit’, and the case-marking particle に. を 限 りに is primarily used for making proclamations or announcements, and is more formal than similar structures like 限 りで. Fun Fact Although を 限 りに almost always follows words indicating a specific time or place that is being viewed temporally, there is also the set expression 声 を 限 りに , ‘to the limit of one’s voice’ that breaks this usual rule."

As a result, んばかり simply indicates the volitional form of (A) as appearing to be about to happen. んばかりに will appear linked to the indeterminate form of verbs (ない stem), and then followed by a statement that is being modified by the に. If んばかり will modify a noun instead, の will replace に. Caution When attached to the indeterminate form of verbs, there is some contention among linguists whether ん is an abbreviation of む, the classical way of expressing う or よう, or whether it is an abbreviation of ぬ, the classical way of expressing ない. Due to being unable to accurately determine what the actual origin is, it would be advisable to choose whichever variation helps to remember the nuance of the grammar point on a case-by-case basis."

They will convey that something has been done 'to the limit'. 上 がる will be used for actions that take place by themselves (intransitive), while 上 げる will be used for actions that have an instigator (transitive). Although 上 げる and 上 がる show that something has been done 'to the limit', the nuance is usually 'to do (A) to the point of completion', or 'to do (A) through to the end'. Therefore, the 'limit' that is being highlighted is usually a natural ending, and not due to running out of some kind of resource. Let's have a look at some examples. 上 げる and 上 がる are most commonly used when some kind of effect or product is produced as a result of the (A) action. In these cases, the literal meaning of 'to (A) up' is very similar to 'to finish up (A)' in English. Caution 仕上 がる is a very common expression that is used for many things. Usually it conveys that something has been completed after some involved or time consuming process."

The case marking particle に will come after 代 わり, before a (B) statement will highlight who the replacement is, and possibly what they are doing. As 代 わり is a noun, it may be used after the attributive form of any word. Occasionally, 替 わり 'to exchange' may be used instead of 代 わり 'to substitute'. However, within the context of this particular grammar structure, there is little to no change in nuance. Fun Fact 代 わりに is often used at the beginning of sentences, simply to express a more preferable option for something. In these cases, it comes across as 'rather than that, (A)', or 'instead, (A)'."

This is a formal structure that is rarely found in daily speech. This construction may be used with verbs and い-Adjectives in their standard forms, and な-Adjectives or nouns followed by である 以上 は . As with many other grammar points, the particle is often dropped, leaving 以上 by itself. Due to である 以上 は often presenting something which is being acted upon, the (B) part of sentences that include this grammar structure will frequently include the resolutions or intentions of the speaker, and can be thought of as either obvious or necessary once considering (A). This usually appears in the form of べきだ, つもりだ, はずだ, たい, ほうがいい, and similar patterns. Fun-fact Despite the standard translations, the literal meaning of 'above and beyond (A), (B)' is also a good way to remember this grammar pattern, as it basically highlights that anything 'past', 'beyond', or 'above' (A) is what needs to be considered."

As an adverb, 僅 か will appear as 僅 かに . Due to 僅 か highlighting an extremely small amount of something, it is often used when the speaker is trying to be modest in indicating that something is nothing more than a trifling amount, such as the difference between their and another's opinions. Fun Fact 僅 か may also be used simply as a noun without the case-marking particle に following it. In these cases, it will just mean ‘a meager thing’, ‘a trifle’, ‘an insignificance’, or any other such word that indicates something that is exceptionally small in size or number."

This means that the (A) verb cannot be completed specifically because there is too much/many of something in order to finish it. 切 れない may also imply that something cannot be done 'to the point of satisfaction'.

While there is no strict rule for when this prefix can be used, it is almost always seen before words of Chinese origin (kanji compounds), or katakana words. Although this kanji is used to mark 'each', it is very rarely used to mark units of time. The most common/natural usage of 各 is for identifying things that are part of a sequence. For example: Each/Every stop, on a train line that has many stops. Each/Every page, in a book that has many pages. Each/Every floor, in a building that has many floors. Each/Every house, in a street of many houses. Fun Fact This kanji is used in another word, 各々 , which also means 'each', but is primarily used for identifying people."

In terms of products and similar items, although 向 け highlights that something has been intended for (A), it doesn't necessarily mean that it is limited to (A). Caution 向 け , coming from the transitive verb 向 ける is used far more often to express that something has been specifically designed for (A). On the other hand, the suffix stemming from the intransitive verb 向 く, ( 向 き ), expresses something that faces toward (A), but perhaps not intentionally."

In almost all circumstances, it can be translated directly as 'depending on', and will be followed by either the auxiliary verb だ at the end of sentences, or the conjunctive form of だ, で, when used in the middle of a sentence. いかん will follow nouns, and may or may not be preceded by の. Occasionally, いかん will be followed by によって. This may seem like repetition for no particular reason, but in most cases it will just strengthen the original meaning of 'depending on', and can be literally translated as 'depending on what way (A) is oriented, (B)'. いかん itself is used in a very similar way to 次第 'upon (A)', or 'depending on (A)', and more often than not implies that the degree of (A) will be the factor that determines the overall result. Due to this, it will often be followed by subclauses that use verbs of decision making such as 決 まる. Fun Fact いかん , like いかに, is simply another word that has the same meaning as どう 'how', and even shares the same kanji structure of 如何 , 如何 . It is also quite common to see the structure かどうであるによって 'depending on in what way' used as an explanation for the meaning of いかん in various dictionaries and other teaching resources. Due to this, it may be beneficial to simply consider いかん as a less common version of どう, or かどうである."

In these cases, the meaning is usually translated as 'per (A)', or 'each (A)'. Let's take a look at some examples. Fun Fact While the literal meaning of 当 たり is 'to meet' (as in 'to come into physical contact with'), as a suffix , 当 たり has a nuance that is similar to に 対 して 'to be in relation to'. This similarity can be seen in the following: (A) 当 たり (B) - Regarding (A), (B) equates to it. (A) に 対 して (B) - Regarding (A), (B) equates to it."

However, 必 ずしも is an expression that is only used in negative sentences, so is commonly translated as 'not always (A)', 'not entirely (A)', or 'not necessarily (A)'. Despite this, the literal meaning is close to 'not absolutely certainly (A)'. 必 ずしも is often used at the beginning of a phrase, before expressing something that is not 100% certain."

When combined with に, like まだ, 未 だ will indicate that something is 'still (A)', or 'not yet (A)', depending on whether the verb it is paired with is negated or not. As 未 だに will be used adverbially, it will mostly appear at the beginning of sentences. Compared to まだ , 未 だに is more formal, and will often imply that something has been continuing for a much longer period of time. This is similar to adding the word ずっと to a standard sentence."

In this lesson, we will look at the meaning associated with the conjunctive form of standard verbs, and the stem of する verbs. Although it is a noun, 次第 may also be classified simply as a suffix in many cases. Basically, 次第 means 'next in sequence after (A)', and is often translated to 'as soon as (A)'. Fun Fact One of the most important things to keep in mind with 次第 , is that the literal meaning in almost every situation is 'determining sequence'. This is unlike any standard phrase in English, but simply expresses that (A) is what will govern (B). Let's look at how this translates with different word types. Verb 次第 - Verb determines the sequence of (B). Since a verb is not capable of making a choice, (A) simply 'happening' will result in (B). Living noun 次第 - Noun determines the sequence of (B). Since living things can make choices, (B) will depend on (A). Inanimate/abstract noun 次第 - Noun determines the sequence of (B). Since inanimate/abstract things cannot make choices, (A) will determine (B)'s course of action. (B) will usually involve some kind of decision."

In many cases, 点 will be followed by the case marking particle で, but other particles may be used depending whether 点 is being conveyed as a subject, object, destination, or something being utilized. Sometimes, で (as 'with' or 'at') may be replaced with expressions such as について 'in relation to (A)', or からいうと 'speaking from (A)'. So long as the grammar structure that accompanies 点 is also used to highlight something specific (and can be paired with a noun), it will sound natural."

In many cases, either (A) or (B) alone could achieve (C), but their combined action will bring about a better result. This structure is a combination of 相 , 'mutual', or 'reciprocal', and the て-form of the う-Verb 俟 つ 'to wait on'. In this pattern, both (A) and (B) will often come before 相 まって , with either of the case-marking particles と or が being used after the nouns. Common translations include '(A) combined with (B) will (C)', or 'coupled together with (A), (B) will (C)'. As for a literal translation, 'mutually depending on each other, (C)' is fairly close to the exact nuance. See the fun-fact for more about this. Fun Fact Although 俟 つ 'to wait on' and 待 つ 'to wait for' are very similar, they have a primary difference in their focus. 待 つ indicates waiting in the sense of 'waiting for (A) to come', while 俟 つ indicates 'waiting for (A) to go'. What this means is that with 相 まって and other uses of 俟 つ, the important thing happens after (A) and (B) come together. This gives the nuance of (A) and (B) having some kind of reliance on each other in order to do (C). Due to 俟 つ being far less common in modern Japanese, it will often be written in hiragana."

This can also often come across as 'no more than (A)', especially in cases where no actual barrier exists, but the speaker cannot imagine that anything higher (or lower) than (A) is possible. As 精々 is an adverb, it often appears at the beginning of sentence, or at the beginning of the second clause of a sentence, before the thing that is thought to be at its maximum is described. Fun-fact 精々 is said to have come from the old-fashioned word 精試 , which meant 'to completely exhaust all of one's good faith'. In modern times, 精々 itself has kept this meaning of 'completely exhausting (A)'. However, this is no longer used in reference to 'good faith', but rather exhausting all of one's 'power', 'mental capacity', or 'power of assumption' in relation to (A)."

The primary meanings are as follows: (A) 込 む - To enter completely into doing (A), or the state of being in (A). (A) 込 む - To enter a state of doing (A) that will not be considered complete until 'success'. (A) 込 む - To enter a state of doing (A) that cannot be escaped from. In this lesson, we will exclusively focus on the first meaning, which is usually translated as 'to put into (A)', or 'to go into (A)'. This form will be attached to the conjunctive form of other verbs. Despite the multiple meanings, 込 む can almost always be thought of as 'jamming (B) into (A)'. This means that whatever the (A) action is, will be something that is not easily entered, but also not easily escaped from."

'The conjunctive form' is much more accurate, as it is used with more than just verbs. Basically, the conjunctive form is the form of any word that will be used in standard conjugation with other structures. For い-Adjectives , this is the form that uses く, for verbs, the ます stem. The reason that conjunctive form is sometimes referred to as 'the formal conjunctive' is due to its use before a comma. Usually, the conjunction particle て would be used to separate clauses in sentences, however, the formal conjunctive allows this to be done without て. Let's look at some examples. As we can see, although て is not required, a 読点 (Japanese comma) will be required to prevent the sentence from becoming confusing. Caution This type of conjugation is seen primarily in formal writing, and the standard て form will be heard much more frequently in daily speech."

It will follow either number words, or nouns. Possible translations include 'not even one (A)', and 'not a single (A)'. However, due to たりとも just being a combination of the auxiliary verb たり 'presenting examples', and the conjunction particle とも 'presenting approximate limitations', the literal translation of たりとも is just 'even limited to (A) as an example, not (B)', with the 'not (B)' coming from the negative structure in the second half of the sentence. This is a very formal expression, so will not be used in daily conversation. Fun Fact 何人 たりとも 'no matter who it is, no exceptions' is a set expression that may see more frequent use than any of the other たりとも structures."

This use of なり will indicate that either (A) or (B) is fine, but anything else that falls within that same category is probably fine too. Due to this, it is non-exhaustive. なり is a fairly polite construction and will appear after either verbs in their dictionary forms , or nouns that may or may not be followed by another particle. This is in cases where that particle is giving important information involved in the 'choice'. An example of this would be に for marking a location. As with all adverbial particles , なり cannot follow either が or を. Caution This emphasis on (A) なり (B) なり presenting lists from which something will be chosen is what differentiates it from similar structures such as など and や. Due to this, なり will not be used to mean 'such as', but only for 'either, or' statements."

This is quite emphatic, and has a literal meaning similar to 'say it does (A) or say it doesn't (A), it will still be (B)'. As a reminder, the positive auxiliary verbs of volition are either う or よう, depending on what they are being connected to, while the negative auxiliary verb of volition is まい. Either the case marking particle が or と will appear after both the positive and the negative, with が being slightly more common. While this structure is primarily seen after verbs, it is important to remember that other auxiliary verbs such as だ can be conjugated in the same way, as can い-Adjectives with the less common かろう structure. This means that both nouns, な-Adjectives and い-Adjectives can also appear using a similar grammar pattern. However, because the negative volitional まい cannot pair with these structures, an antonym will usually appear with them instead, with both words using the う or よう positive volitional. Based primarily on the use of volitionals, this grammar pattern will often indicate the speaker's strong will or opinion that will not change regardless of (A)."

It will allow us to list multiple qualities/traits of something. For い-Adjectives , we will need to change the last い to く (the form used for conjugation), and then simply add て . For nouns and な-Adjectives , we will need to add で to the base form (not な or だ ). It should be noted that て and で are different structures here. て is the same conjunction particle that is used with verbs (meaning that い-Adjectives are similar to verbs), while で is actually a form of だ that is used for conjugation. It is the same で as the one that is used in the formal version of だ , である . Which we will learn later. Caution Like other て forms ( ている 1 , ている 2 , and ている 3 ), the て (or で ) form of other words can have several possible meanings. These meanings are as follows. Linking - Like 'and' in English. Reasons - Like 'with (A)', or 'because of (A)' in English. Manner - Like 'to do (B) in an (A) way' in English. Caution As with all other conjugations of いい , remember that it will be よくて, and not いくて."

For い-Adjectives , this conjunctive form is created by removing い, and replacing it with く. The ない used with い-Adjectives is considered to be a different word to the ない used with verbs. When used with い-Adjectives , ない itself is also an い-Adjective . This means that it follows the same rules as regular い-Adjectives . Due to ません (the polite negative form) being an auxiliary verb ,  it cannot be conjugated with い-Adjectives in the same way as verbs. As can be seen here, you must first add the verb ある , and then conjugate it into its negative form using the auxiliary verb ません. This is how the polite negative is created. Caution As with regular い-Adjectives , you cannot use だ after ない . です is acceptable to create a semi-polite form, but is best used in spoken language only."

Due to this, も can translate as 'as much as (A)', or 'not even (A)', and other similar phrases in this expression.

The main differences are as follows: Adverbial Particle: 副助詞 - Highlights uncertain things ' 不確 かであること'. This is the same か as in どこか 'somewhere'. Sentence Ending Particle: 終助詞 - Highlights doubts and questions ' 疑問 や 質問 '. This is a direct question. In the case of the adverbial particle か and 'uncertain things', this will almost always be followed by a word that is seeking information about the uncertain thing. As can be seen in these examples, sometimes the adverbial particle will appear by itself, and sometimes it will appear together with the sentence ending particle in the same sentence. However, due to the 'uncertainty' being displayed by the adverbial particle, the question marker at the end of the sentence is not required. Caution This か should not be preceded by だ (or です ), this is why words like どこか and 誰 か are not どこ だか and 誰 だか."

Note also that れる and られる themselves behave like standard る-Verbs, so can be conjugated into a variety of different tenses in the same way as a standard verb. A common sight in modern Japanese is words where the ら may be removed, 'ラ 抜 き 言葉 ', and れる may be used by itself. However, this is not technically correct Japanese, and may cause confusion in cases where ら is required (with る-Verbs and くる , when られる is expressing 'passivity', 'respect', or 'spontaneous occurrence'). For う-Verbs , they will behave a little differently. Instead of the final kana of the verb changing to an あ sound, and then adding れる (as would be the case with passive verbs), the final kana of the verb will change to an え sound (る will become れ, う will become え, す will become せ, etc.) before adding る. Interestingly, する verbs do not have a ' potential ' form, and the verb できる will be used in its place. Caution ことができる and られる (when used in its ' potential ' meaning) have exactly the same nuance. However, many people consider ことができる to be slightly more polite. Fun Fact When using the potential form, either を or が may be used to mark the 'object'. You will need to be careful though, as this does not apply to できる , which may only ever use が ."

In the first example, we can see that 'Takashi-san is a man that lives in Tokyo', is one sentence, rather than 'Takashi-san is a man. He lives in Tokyo'. In English, words like 'that', and 'which' are used to create a relative clause. However, seeing as though these words do not exist in Japanese, the first phrase is simply attached to the noun.

The case marking particle と in this expression highlights a 'result'. To use おうとする , modify the (A) verb into its う or よう receiving form, and then add とする. As う and よう mark volition (the express intent to do something), とする adds the nuance that the express intent has been decided, and all that remains is to 'do' the action. This translates quite closely to 'to endeavor to do' in English, where the past form 'endeavored to do' will suggest that the attempt was unsuccessful. Caution ようとする is also regularly used to indicate when one action interrupts another. In these cases, the nuance is not quite 'to have endeavored', but more '(A) was already underway, when (B)'. Again, it will just show that the (A) action was decided upon 100%, when something caused an unexpected change."
