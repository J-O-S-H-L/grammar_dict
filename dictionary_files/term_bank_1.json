                        "content": "飽 く is the old-fashioned and somewhat poetic version of 飽 きる the る-Verb meaning 'to tire of (A)', or 'to get sick of (A)'. When used in conjunction with the adverbial particles まで 'until', and も 'even', 飽 くまでも will imply that (A) is being done 'persistently', 'stubbornly', or 'to the bitter end'. The more literal translation of 'to continue (A) even to the point of getting tired of it' fits these interpretations quite well. 飽 くまでも will often come at the beginning of sentences before going on to describe that thing that is being done persistently. も is not required, and 飽 くまで may sometimes be seen without it. However, as the phrase is quite strong, it is far more common for も to be included to highlight the emphasis. Due to the persistence that the verb 飽 く itself can highlight, it will often be seen together in sentences that include words like つもり 'intention', to show that someone intends to do something regardless of the consequences. Despite 飽 くまで being a combination of 飽 く and まで, it will appear in most dictionaries as a standalone adverb in modern Japanese."

It will often be translated as '(B) owes everything to (A)', or '(B) existing is only due to (A)'. This structure is a combination of the う-Verb ある 'to be' in its て-form, and the case-marking particle の. あっての will be preceded and followed directly by nouns, where the first noun is (A), and the second noun is (B). あっての will primarily be used when (B) is something that benefits positively from (A), and therefore is showing or should show some kind of gratitude toward it. Occasionally, the case-marking particle が will come between the (A) noun and あっての . However, it is often omitted. Fun Fact あっての can be thought of as an evolution of the basic grammar structure がある 'to have'. The main difference being that の allows (B) to be marked as the thing that has (A), while the て-form indicates that there is more information that will be given later about why this is important. Due to this information that comes later being important, (B) will almost always be followed by structures like から, or ので."

When paired with the ない form of a word, it translates to 'not very (A)', or 'hardly (A)'. To pair あまり (or the casual form, あんまり ) with another word, we just need to place it at the beginning of a phrase, or directly before the ない statement. Fun Fact Although あまり～ない is regularly translated as 'not very' the literal translation is closer to 'not excessively (A)'. This is due to 余 り (the kanji which this word comes from), meaning 'excessive', or 'to be in excess'. あまり has this meaning of 'excessive' in all of its grammar points, and the nuance will only change based on whether the sentence itself is positive (does not use ない), or negative (uses ない)."

Similarly to お〜する , いたす means 'to do'. In the case of する verbs themselves, simply replace する with いたす . For other verbs, add いたす to the ます stem of the verb, while attaching お, or ご to the beginning (depending on whether it is a word of Japanese or Chinese origin). Caution Words that include the kanji 拝 'to worship', or 'to revere', do not usually require お, ご, or いたす . This is due to the word itself being 'respectful'.

As a predicate , い-Adjectives can appear by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used at the end of a sentence. When there are no other words apart from the adjective itself, it comes across similar to 'It's cute', or 'It's hot', and similar expressions in English. We just have to guess what the 'it' is from context. In many sentences, either は or が could be used to mark the word/words that the predicate is describing. However, which one sounds more natural will depend on many factors. In general, if you are specifically pointing out something as being different from other things in the same category, が will be used. In this example, が is distinguishing this specific bath as having a unique level of hotness compared to others (maybe the water system is broken and only boiling water comes out). は would sound unnatural in this type of sentence, as it is not the 'normal' state of the bath. Fun Fact All い-Adjectives are words of Japanese origin."

This change in kana is a bit different to other conjugations of う-Verbs , so let's take a look at them for the casual form. As can be seen in these examples, the changes consist of った, いた, いだ, んだ, した (the same as the changes for て form , but using た instead). For the conjugations using だ in place of た, this is simply a sound change in the language that happened over the course of history, to make words easier/smoother to say. It is not the auxiliary verb だ . For the polite past form of う-Verbs , the change in sound is far more consistent. This only requires a change from the う sound, to the い sound within the same column (from う to い, or from く to き, for example). When た is added to verbs (or any other word), it can have one of three possible meanings. Past: 過去 - Happened at some point in the past. (Did/Was) Completion: 完了 - An action that has finished 'happening'. (Done) Continuation: 存続 - A new state of something that is continuing. (Has been done) Caution With う-Verbs , there are a few verbs that are exceptions to the regular conjugation rules. Please check the structure guide for these."

It is usually translated simply as 'thanks to (A)', or 'because of (A)'. おかげで is a combination of the polite prefix お, the noun 陰 'shade', and the case marking particle で. おかげで can be used after any word in its attributive form . Literally, お 陰 で means 'in the shade of (A)'. This implies that (B) was only made possible due to (A) creating the ideal situation for it to occur. Caution おかげで may sometimes be used sarcastically, in the same way as 'thanks to (A)' in English. In these sentences, it is usually quite clear from the context/tone of voice that the actual meaning is negative. Fun Fact おかげで is often used at the beginning of a sentence in the same way as 'thankfully' or 'luckily' in English. This just means that whatever comes after おかげで happened, despite negative outcomes also being possible."

The primary difference between お and ご, is that お will be used with words/readings of Japanese origin (kun-yomi), and ご will be used with words/readings of Chinese origin (on-yomi). In fact, お and ご are both represented by the same kanji. For this kanji, 御 is one of the kun-yomi, and 御 is one of the on-yomi. Fun Fact Some verbs, like いでる, are used almost exclusively with honorific language . おいでになる (the お～になる form of いでる) is an example of this, and can mean 'to come', 'to go', or 'to be'. This is due to the perspective of the speaker when using honorific language , and something that we will discuss in more detail later."

We will focus on the former in this lesson. かというと is a combination of the case marking particle か in its use as a question marker, the case marking particle と in its citation use, the う - Verb 言 う 'to say', and the case marking particle と in its result use. This is quite a few particles combined together, but the literal meaning is more simply 'if (A) were to be asked', before the speaker will go on to highlight their reasoning in (B). As ～かというと will come before some sort of explanation, から will also regularly be used at the end of the sentence as 'because', emphasizing the speaker's reasoning. Caution Like other grammar points that utilize the 'if' nuance of と , ば , and sometimes even たら may be used. However, たら will appear far less frequently than と or ば ."

It is often translated as 'quite', 'fairly', 'considerably', or 'pretty'. かなり will almost always appear directly before a phrase, or directly before a noun (in which case の will come between the noun and かなり). Fun Fact かなり originally came from 可也 , and more recently 可成 . Both of these expressions mean something similar to 'to become undeniable', with the former structure using an older kanji for 'to become' 也 . かなり is still used this way today, highlighting that the amount/existence of something has reached a point that cannot be denied. かなり may be seen with this meaning when carrying either positive and negative connotations."

The more literal meaning can be thought of as 'is it not like (A)?', due to the uncertainty expressed by か. かのようだ may follow verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns followed by である. When ようだ is altering the meaning of a verb or a noun later in the sentence, ように or ような may also be used. This grammar construction will often be seen with expressions that emphasize the speaker's assumption about (A), such as まるで.

As this grammar structure often includes a negative statement in the (B) part of the sentence, the more literal translation is closer to 'from saying that (A), doesn't mean (B)'. This simply focuses the nuance on that (A) does not equal (B), despite what one may think. からといって may appear after verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns that are followed by だ. In most cases, からといって will be used for giving strong opinions, or for criticism of someone's actions or behavior. Caution - It is not rare to see からといって abbreviated as either からとて , or からって . There is no change in meaning in either of these cases, but they are more colloquial."

It is often translated as 'because', or 'since'. In these cases, it just means 'Because of (A), (B)'. から may be used with almost any type of word, but when the nuance is 'because', it will require だ before it when following a noun or な-Adjective . Despite having several different nuances, it may be easier to think of から as meaning 'from' in all situations, as that is the base nuance. From (A as a reason), (B) = Because/Since. From (A as a location), (B) = From. Fun Fact から is a special type of particle in Japanese called a case marking particle .

Caution In a relative clause, because (A) is describing (B), (B) will be considered the 'main topic/subject'. This means that は will generally not be used in place of が . However, の can be used instead of が , as showing a relationship between (A) and (B) is one of the main functions of の ."

To use がする , simply attach it to the end of any phrase that expresses which type of 'sense' is being created/given off by the subject. Fun Fact Japanese often uses 気 'energy', 'spirit', as something that can be perceived with the senses. Due to this, there are many phrases which use ～ 気 がする in the same way as this grammar point."

It is a combination of the case-marking particle が, the い-Adjective 早 い 'soon', and the adverbial particle か. It is often translated as 'no sooner than (A), (B)', or 'the instant that (A), (B)'. The more literal translation, taking into account the use of か, is '(A), or possibly sooner, (B)'. This just illustrates the instantaneousness of the (B) action in that (A) was unable to be determined as actually completed before (B) started. This grammar pattern is formal, and will follow verbs in their dictionary or past tense forms. The verb that comes in the (B) phrase will always be in the past tense. (A) will tend to be actions that happen momentarily, or having a clearly defined finish point. For actions that don't have a clearly defined finish point, 終 わる 'to finish' will often be linked to the stem form, in order to specify the end. Additionally, while the (B) action will often be unexpected, it will also usually be volitional, that is to say something done intentionally. Caution Due to が 早 いか always expressing something in the past, it cannot be used to express wishes or intentions for the future. Additionally, it will not highlight the speaker's own actions."

(A) をきっかけに (B), or (A) がきっかけで (B). This grammar pattern may be seen either with verbs in their past-tense form or nouns. However, in the case of appearing after verbs, it will often be preceded by の or some other nominalizing structure like こと. In many cases, the trigger of (A) will have the effect of instigating a rather large change or new beginning. Caution - きっかけ will not be used when the causal relationship between (A) and (B) is plainly obvious, due to what would be expected or easy to anticipate result. Because of this, it can be thought that きっかけ is almost always referring to the opportunity of (B) appearing because of (A), with some external choice being made, or action being taken on that occasion."

The other primary verb being する . 来 る means 'to come', or 'to be coming'. 来 る will always have the particle に or へ attached to the location that someone 'will come', or 'has come'. The reason that 来 る is called a か-column irregular conjugation verb in Japanese is because the る in 来 る does not conjugate, but is dropped. This leaves the く being the part that conjugates. Because of this, 来る has qualities of both る-Verbs (the る being dropped), and う-Verbs (the remaining く changing depending on the conjugation). Here are some examples of how 来 る changes. （き）た, （く）る, （こ）ない. 来 る will often be seen as 来 ている when someone has come to a place and remains there. This is due to ている meaning 'to exist in the state of an action', rather than being exactly the same as '(A)~ing' in English. Because of this, 来 ている can mean either 'to be somewhere that one has come', or 'to be coming'. Sometimes the difference between these two will not be clear unless there is further context. Caution 来 ている (for existing at a place) is only used for places that people 'temporarily' go, so will not be used when you are at your home/work."

In sentences with ことか , words that highlight some particular number or extent are often used, before ことか comes at the end of the statement, expressing that 'extent' as being particularly unusual, or even unbelievable (thanks to the addition of か). This is often translated simply as 'how (A)', 'what (A)', or even 'god knows (A)'. Let's look at a few examples. Literally, ことか can be translated as 'to what particular (A) is (B)!?', as the enquiry is often not directed at anyone specifically, but instead presents itself as a question simply to emphasize its magnitude. Caution In modern Japanese, this expression is used primarily in written language, and has a tendency to sound either poetic, or dramatic. Because of this, it may sound unnatural in daily speech, unless the speaker is purposely being dramatic."

As with んです , ことなの transforms 'it is (A)', into 'it is that it is (A)', simply emphasizing the point. ことなの may be seen in several different forms, and is quite often used in conjunction with というのは . In these types of sentences, というのは will present the topic, before ことなの will be used to show the conclusion that the speaker has drawn about that topic. This expression may be used with any word in its attributive form , nouns followed by の, or な-Adjectives followed by な. という may also be used directly before ことなの . However, this is not always the case, and is even more unlikely when it was already utilized in the first half of the sentence. Caution As というのは is quite long, it will often be shortened to って or とは in casual speech. Caution ことなの is also frequently used when asking questions. This is usually when the speaker has drawn a conclusion about something that has been said, and wants to confirm their understanding. なのか is very frequently heard/seen in drama, novels, manga, and similar types of media, but may be considered rude in daily speech."

In this way, the literal meaning is that 'just because of (A), (B) is not something that will come about'.

                        "content": "In a very similar way to のは , こと is used in Japanese for nominalization (creating a noun-like phrase). However, unlike のは , which is a combination of two particles, こと is a noun . To use こと , just add it to the end of a verb in its dictionary form. こと (or 事 in its kanji form) is a noun that is often translated as 'thing', and in this way, literally means 'the thing that is (A)' when used for nominalization. As we can see from these examples, ない can also be used between the verb and こと , to form a 'not' statement. There are other auxiliary verbs that may be used with こと in this way, but ない is the most common. Although this lesson discusses こと pairing with the dictionary form of verbs, it can actually pair with any standard verb form. Standard form just means anything that does not finish with the polite ます. Fun Fact Unlike もの (another noun used to describe 'things'), こと is a noun that is frequently used to describe things that are 'intrinsic'. This basically means things that are describable, but not necessarily always observable (feelings, conditions, events, etc.). Caution When a sentence (usually short) finishes with こと , it quite often has the nuance of being a rule, or command. This こと is not actually a noun, but a sentence ending particle . こと as a particle will almost never be written in the kanji form. However, it does originate from the same word."

Together, they are used adverbially to express that something happens 'every (A)', or 'at intervals of (A)'. ごとに may be used after any verb (usually in non-past form), or noun. Although ごとに may be used after verbs, the most common use is with nouns, or phrases that finish with nouns. Caution ごと is the 訓読 み (Japanese reading) of the kanji 毎 , which means 'every'. This fact will be important when trying to remember the difference between ごとに and おきに , a similar grammar point which can also mean 'every', but focuses more on 'interval' or 'gap' of a specific time or distance. Due to おきに focusing on the space between 'each (A)', there are sentences where おきに and ごとに will have different meanings. Here, we can see that ごとに will mean 'every week', while おきに will mean 'every second week', due to there being a 'one week interval' when おきに is used. To make things easier, these two expressions can be remembered in the following way. (A) ごとに = During every (A), (B). (A) おきに = After every space of (A), (B). Fun Fact Many native speakers make mistakes with the difference between おきに and ごとに , so there are quite a large number of people (especially in the younger generation) that will consider them completely interchangeable."

As 流石 is an adverb, it may appear at the beginning of phrases (either with or without に), or directly preceded a noun when の is used. Caution Although uncommon, さすが may occasionally have a negative connotation. In these cases, it is similar to 'even' in English. This use of さすが implies that 'as one had though, even (A) couldn't (B)', and similar nuances. Fun-fact The kanji structure of 流石 is a type of kanji use known as 借字 in Japanese. This basically means 'borrowed symbol', and indicates that the meaning of the kanji is not related to the meaning of the word at all."

These are as follows: 誘 い、 促 し - To invite, incite, or draw attention to something. 驚 き、 当惑 し - The express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment. 話 の 流 れ を 抑 える - To control or keep in check the flow of a conversation. In this lesson, we will be focusing on a specific feature of the first meaning (to draw attention). Unlike other types of drawing attention that さ is able to be used for (see this grammar point), this さ will only appear at the end of sentences. Here, さ is almost identical in meaning to that of よ, with a slight added nuance of high confidence in what one is saying. Caution This さ is primarily used by men, and can vary in meaning depending on the speaker's tone of voice. However, in almost all situations さ will mean 'what I just said is correct' (sometimes angrily, sometimes informatively, and even sometimes in a completely carefree way). Women may also use さ as a sentence ender, but わよ tends to be more common."

This is a somewhat formal grammar pattern which indicates that both (A) and (B) exist at the same time, or are in unison. しかも itself focuses on the overall topic, so will be used for giving objective opinions, such as observable facts, rather than personal opinions. As しかも is a conjunction, it may be used between two phrases, or sometimes at the beginning of a second sentence, when referring back to the first. Often, (A) will be considered the 'base' information, while (B) is extra information added on top of (A), or further explaining (A). Fun-fact Originally, しかも came from the combination of the archaic interjection 然 'as such', or 'like that', and the particle も 'too', or 'also'. In this way, some reflection can be seen between it and modern English phrases like 'additionally', where the (B) information is simply adding on to what is already known about (A). Fun-fact In modern writing, しかも may also appear as either 而 も or 併 も , although both are quite rare."

All な-Adjectives behave similarly to verbs, in that their form changes depending on what comes after them. For 好 き , it will be followed by な when acting as an adjective, or one of either だ or the more polite です when acting as a noun. This distinction is made depending on whether it is linked to another noun, or is independent. In the example with だ, 好 き is expressing that the thing is 'likable' (assertion). However, in the example with な , 好 き is expressing 'likability' as a quality of the noun it is attached to. Caution 好 き is considered quite a strong adjective in Japanese when it is directed towards people, so it may be interpreted as romantic interest. 大 好 き is often translated as 'love'."

Usually, 既 に will come at the beginning of a phrase that it is clarifying as being 'already (A)'. すでに has several nuances in Japanese beyond just 'already', let's take a look at a few of these possibilities: のこらず - Nothing remaining. あまねく - All around. ことごとく - Altogether. もはや - Already. まぎれもなく - Beyond doubt. These may all seem quite different, but together they show the full meaning of 既 に very clearly. That meaning is 'to be completely unchanging'. Let's take a look at how すでに can be used with each of these nuances. Caution Due to 既 に implying something absolutely cannot be changed, it is often used to imply that something is 'too late', and that nothing else can be done about it."

This structure may be translated as 'completely (A)', 'all in (A)', or 'nothing but (A)'. Generally, it is attached directly to nouns, and expresses that (A) is to such an extent that nothing apart from (A) can be seen, felt, or noticed. In cases where ずくめ will directly modify the following noun, の will come between ずくめ and that noun. Although づくめ may occasionally be seen in older literature, it is mostly considered incorrect kana usage these days. While ずくめ may be used in either positive or negative contexts, it is mainly seen in set expressions, so is best used with combinations that you have already heard or read. Fun Fact 尽 くし is another older structure that is used to express things that are separate, but are grouped together. This is usually translated as 'all sorts of (A)', or 'all kinds of (A)'. It is the conjunctive form of the う-Verb 尽 くす 'to be exhaustive' with a voiced pronunciation of the つ."

It is a formal expression that is a combination of the negative classical auxiliary verb , ず, the case-marking particle に, the adverbial particle は, and the standard negated form of the う-Verb 済 む ‘to come to pass’, or ‘to finish’. Due to this, the more literal translation is ‘it will not come to pass that (A) is not done’, with the more natural English interpretations conveying the same feeling. As we can assume by this expression beginning with ず, it will exclusively follow verbs. Just like other instances where ず is used with する, ぜず will be the correct conjugation pattern. The standard (ない) negative form of a verb may also be followed by ではすまない. This has the same meaning as ずにはすまない. Caution This construction will tend to sound unnatural in cases where the speaker only considers (A) to be something that is necessary based on their personal feelings. (A) is usually something that would be the expected course of action according to anyone."

Being an adverb that often modifies the meaning of a whole sentence, it will commonly appear at the beginning of a statement. When 折角 is nominating an event as being long awaited, it will appear directly before the event, separated only by the case marking particle の. Fun Fact There are several guesses for where 折角 originates. One of the most common is that it is an abbreviation for 頭巾 の 角 を 折 る 'to fold the horn (tail) of a hood'. This was something that a famous confucian did intentionally to protect his hood from getting wet in the rain. The people of the time started to copy the act, and 折角 also came to be used as an idiom to mean 'intentionally', or 'to go out of one's way to do something'."

Caution Due to そういえば refering to something that has already been brought up over the course of a conversation, it will not be used to move on to completely unrelated topics in the same way that phrases like 'by the way' are used in English. Fun-fact そういえば is very similar in the way it is used to といえば, with そう simply replacing the direct quotation of と. Many textbooks will list both as a single grammar point, despite そういえば itself basically being a set phrase."

As with そうだ , そうに and そうな carry the meaning of 'seeming like (A)', or 'looking like (A)'. Caution そう may also be used when attached to the い-Adjective , ない. In this case, there is a unique conjugation rule which you will need to be careful of. As always, い will be removed from ない before attaching そう . However, さ will need to be inserted between な, and そう . This results in the construction なさそう. Note that this addition of さ does not happen with verbs.

In this way, it translates to 'therefore', 'because of that', or 'with that' where 'that' is the previous information. それで is frequently used at the beginning of a second sentence, to highlight the information from the first. Caution You may also see それでは . で in this case is the conjunctive form of だ (the auxiliary verb). Due to this, the meaning is closer to 'well then', 'in that case', or 'if so'.

Almost any そんなに based sentence can be translated literally as 'to an extent like (A)', where (A) is the word that comes after そんなに , and に indicates 'to'.

Caution たくさん may be used before a noun without also using の . However, in this case, it will feel more like たくさん is describing the whole phrase, rather than just the noun it is in front of. If you strongly want to highlight the noun, using の would be best. In these examples, the only difference is that the sentence with の feels like the speaker is putting extra focus on the people, rather than the gathering that is happening."

After this, the (B) phrase will then describe what is happening during (A). ～たなり will primarily be used to express an undesirable state continuing despite (A) having happened, although this is not a strict rule. As ～たなり indicates that (A) is something that is continuing to stay in the same state, it will often have the nuance of 'ever since (A)' in situations where a significant amount of time has passed.

As an extension of this nuance, ものだ can be paired with verbs in the past tense, creating a phrase similar to 'I used to (A) in the past'. However, the literal meaning is closer to '(A) was the way it used to be'. Due to ものだ being a strong determination of something's existence/truth, this expression quite often carries the nuance that the speaker is nostalgic about (A), reminiscing about (A), or being introspective about (A). This means that it will not sound natural when describing things that are seemingly inconsequential, or have no meaningful significance. When highlighting things in the past that are not particularly important, たことがある will be used instead."

In the good situation of (A), the problem of (B) will arise. In the problematic situation of (A), (B) can still be done. So in either case, it can be seen that (B) will be something that is contradictory to (A). Caution In this meaning, なら～で will only ever follow な-Adjectives.

Fun Fact だけしか may appear as though it is saying 'only' twice, but each particle has its own specific nuance. These nuances are as follows: だけ - Removes one thing (from within a group), and presents it as the 'only' thing that fits a certain criteria. しか - Highlights something that exists by itself as not having any alternatives. Due to this, each meaning compounds together, with だけ saying 'just this', while しか adds 'and only this!'. Reversing the order and putting しか before だけ would not work, as the sequence of selection needs to be logical."

Being a combination of だけ 'just', and に 'to', the literal meaning is 'just in that it's (A)', and is similar to the counterpart phrase in English. だけに may be used when highlighting either positive or negative results that came about due to (A), and will appear after verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives that have been followed by な, or nouns. Also, だけに may be used when highlighting that specifically because of (A), (B) is considered a level above what would usually be expected. This can be in terms of difficulty, emotional reaction, volume, or anything else that is quantifiable. Fun-fact With any of these meanings, the equivalent 'just in that it's (A)' English expression can be utilized as an accurate interpretation, as both it and だけに often just draw the listener's attention to (A), in order to show that (B) is noteworthy because of it."

Due to な-Adjectives being able to be used as either a noun or an adjective, the meaning of a sentence will be different depending on whether だけ is used with the noun form, or the adjective form. Basically this difference just highlights whether something is being discussed in a measurable way (an adjective), or an immeasurable way (a noun)."

It has a wide range of uses, but primarily exclaims that something is the 'premise' for whatever has been said, or will be said next. This 'exclamation' is usually translated as 'I heard', 'cause', 'but', or 'even if'. The meaning that will be conveyed is determined primarily by where だって appears in a sentence. When placed at the beginning of a sentence, だって highlights the speaker's (usually) displeasure about something that has just been said, before following it with an explanation or counterpoint. This だって is quite similar to でも . At the end of a sentence, だって is used to express hearsay, in a similar way to 'I heard that', or 'it was said that', in English. In these cases it will be preceded by なん. なんだって always appears after a noun, or a phrase that has been nominalized (with の or こと). Caution When used directly after a noun, だって has a similar nuance to the だって that appears at the beginning of sentences (emphasizing what has come before it, in order to explain further). This comes across as でも , and may not be used with なん. Fun Fact The adverbial particle とて itself is an abbreviation of expressions like と 言 って, and と 思 って. だとて (the full construction) may also be used, but is almost always replaced by だって, as it is far easier to say. Fun Fact When used at the beginning of a sentence, もん or もの will often come at the end of that sentence, in order to strengthen the opinion given by the speaker. This is more commonly used by women and children."

These words may be used either at the beginning of a sentence (to modify the meaning of the whole sentence), or before verbs. ちゃんと and きちんと both translate quite closely to 'properly', or 'neatly'. Fun Fact Historically, ちゃんと was also used to convey 'quickly'. However, it is almost never used for this purpose in modern Japanese. Despite this, both ちゃんと and きちんと do have a slight nuance of doing something 'without dawdling'. This can mostly be attributed to the base meaning of 'properly' also implying that something is not done lazily."

This 'change' is often in regard to an increase, decrease, expansion, contraction, or something similar. This pattern can be translated simply as 'to be (A)ing'. Caution Compared to ている, つつある tends not to be used in relation to noticably physical motions, but rather highlights actions that indicate an ongoing state of change (such as the blooming of a flower), rather than simply 'continuing'. This is especially true for verbs that have an obvious end or completion point."

                        "content": "When joining the conjunction particle て , with the る-Verb あげる (to give), it implies that someone is doing something for the benefit of someone else. Literally, this expression means 'to give/bestow the action of (A) upon (B)', but translates more naturally as 'to do (A) for (B)', or 'to do (A) as a favor for (B)'. The receiver of the てあげる action will be marked with に , while the doer will be marked with が (if mentioned). Caution Unfortunately, てあげる can sound quite patronizing in modern Japanese, and should be avoided in situations where someone may take offence to having something done for them (for example, doing something for someone of higher status). This is primarily due to やる (a casual variation of 'to give') being phased out. Fun Fact Originally, やる was used when referring to giving water to plants, or feeding animals. However, some people started using あげる for these purposes as well, believing that it sounded 'nicer'. Historically, this actually achieved the opposite result, and some people began to think that あげる was insulting, as it was being used for plants/animals. These days, てやる is almost never used, unless you have a very close relationship with someone and are using it jokingly."

Sometimes ていた is used to express things that are still ongoing, but the speaker is not sure about, or would like to politely advise the listener about. This is very similar to the way in which English uses '(A) was doing (B)'. In this example, although the action of 'sitting' is not finished, we can imagine that the speaker is suggesting that 'dad was sitting here, and he still is, but he just went to get a drink'. The same kind of sentence could be used when the speaker has walked away from where their dad was sitting, and doesn't actually know if he is still sitting there or not."

Due to いる being one of the verbs for 'existing' in Japanese, the ている form means something closer to 'continuing to exist in a specific state', rather than (A)~ing in English. This is why verbs like 死 ぬ , and 知 る , appear as the ている form in Japanese, when they would appear as the past form in English."

                        "content": "This grammar point is a combination of the conjunction particle て , and the verb 来 る 'to come'. To use this grammar point, you will need to attach て to any verb, and then follow it with くる . This nuance is usually that '(A) happened, and then came', or 'will happen, and then come'. In other words, it will depend on whether くる is in present, or past tense. てくる can be used when representing time, or when representing a physical place. When representing a physical place, it is more likely that the kanji structure, 来 る will be used. However, this is not a set rule, and depends on the writer. When used in relation to time, the nuance is usually that something has already come to pass, or will start to happen from now. This is the opposite of ていく , which indicates that something will change from the way that it is now, or will continue progressing in a certain way. Fun Fact When compared to English, てくる is very similar to the phrase 'to have come to (A)', in relation to time. This means that it focuses on the fact that the speaker will 'become (A)', should things continue in a specific way. In practice though, it is used like 'gotten' in most situations."

These meanings may seem quite different, but we will discuss their similarities in a moment. Let's look at a few examples of てしまう first. As we can see, verbs that usually take で instead of て will be no different when using てしまう . Sometimes, てしまう or でしまう will be shortened to a more casual form, which are often used in speech. These forms are as follows: てしまう will become ちゃう でしまう will become じゃう Fun Fact While て 終 う is most frequently written in hiragana, て 仕舞 う may also be seen. There is a slight nuance difference between these two kanji structures, but the primary meaning of しまう will always be that 'something has come to the point where ending/ending up in a specific state cannot be avoided'. This 'no turning back point' may be temporary (likely to be written as 仕舞 う) , or it may be permanent (likely to be written as 終 う ). Due to this 'cannot be avoided' nuance, しまう often comes across as 'totally', as in 'ah… I totally left the chicken in the oven for too long'. In these cases, it is simply expressing the speaker's exasperation that something is 'too late' to change. However, despite regularly being used negatively, てしまう can also be used positively. In these cases it still has the nuance of 'no turning back'."

Due to てでも expressing strong will, it will often be seen in sentences that include other phrases that mark desire or intent, such as ほしい, たい, and ようと 思 う. Fun-fact Although てでも is considered a fairly slang expression due to the use of てでも rather than the usual ても that would be expected of a verb, the construction itself of て-form partnered with an adverbial particle is quite common, and often marks emphasis or comparison. This can be seen very regularly with ては in patterns like てはいけない or てはだめ."

This grammar pattern may also be used for highlighting negative sentences, and will translate similarly to 'even if not (A)', or 'even though not (A)' in these cases. Fun Fact でも (the form after nouns and な-Adjectives ) is often considered to be an adverbial particle itself, and there is often debate amongst native speakers as to whether でも is actually a word, or simply a standard grouping of で , the case marking particle and も , the adverbial particle .

In this structure, it should be noted that the (A) verb is not necessarily being done for the first time ever, just that this time resulted in the speaker's first experience of (B). Caution Originally, 始 めて 'commencing with' and 初 めて 'starting with' were both used with this expression. However, this is considered incorrect in modern Japanese, as only 初 めて strictly carries the meaning of 'for the first time'."

Both structures are usually translated as 'even if (A), (B)', or 'no matter if (A), (B)'. Despite this, the more literal meaning of each is closer to 'so it's (A), (B) still won't be affected'. This just emphasizes the fact that (A) is of no relation to the result, like saying 'so what if it is' in English. Both であれ and であろうと will primarily attach to nouns in sentences that express some kind of question or assumption through words like どんな or たとえ. As both であれ and であろうと use structures that indicate strong will, these grammar patterns will frequently be used in sentences where the speaker is expressing their opinions or resolutions."

In a broader sense it just expresses an assertion about something (like です ), that the speaker assumes the listener would probably agree with. In the above, we can see that, in both examples, the speaker is looking for confirmation that/affirming that the listener agrees with them. As でしょう is a conjugation of です (the polite form of だ), it usually follows the plain form of words, rather than words using ～ます. However, in very formal situations, or older literature ～ます でしょう may be seen. Caution Despite sounding relatively low confidence, using でしょう implies that the speaker has some form of information that makes them believe that the (A) statement is true."

In ではなくて , the adverbial particle は is not strictly required. However, as this expression is comparing what (A) is 'not' to what (B) 'is', the contrast that は provides means that the phrase will sound far more natural with its inclusion. Caution て sometimes performs in a similar way to a 'comma' in Japanese, allowing structures to appear together that usually wouldn't. Due to this, if て is omitted from ではなくて , ではなく may not be linked directly to the next word, and a comma will be required. Regarding adjectives, this く form is known as the conjunctive form , and may only be linked directly with other 用言 (conjugatable words), altering or adding to their overall meaning."

At its core, it is always used to highlight something that is 'required' to perform some sort of action/reach some kind of goal. One of these uses relates to 'things'. This comes across as 'by' or 'with' in English. In these sentences, the item is considered essential for the action to be performed. While other items may be used, で simply highlights the one that was chosen. で is also used when groups of people perform actions together, this is something that many people learning Japanese have trouble with initially (because と may also be used as 'with' for people). However, the use of で is actually the same as this by/with, meaning that the speaker considers the group as the tool used for performing the action. The difference between と and で as 'with', is that で is used when everyone in the group has the same objective/end goal. と is used when each person is performing the action toward each other, not toward an external objective."

However, unlike some other structures (like なら , たら , and ば ), と implies that the 'if' result of と is something that will definitely happen, or is a natural consequence of (A) happening. When combined with the い-Adjective いい, it means 'if (A), it would be good'. This construction may be used with any phrase ending in a word in its standard form . Because と expresses a 'certain' outcome, the 'good' in this grammar construction often sounds quite strong, leading to といい regularly being translated closer to 'I hope (A)', or 'I wish (A)'. There are several situations in which this grammar point can be used to express that you are hoping something for yourself, or hoping something for someone else. This is primarily determined by the use of な, or ん だけど (hoping for yourself), or ね (hoping for others/mutual benefit). Caution When this expression finishes with けど , けれども , or が , it can imply that there are some external factors that will make the desired result difficult to achieve."

It is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the う-Verb 言 う 'to say', and the noun ところ 'place', which often marks situations. Common translations include 'I would say about (A)', 'I guess about (A)'. A more literal translation is 'To be at the point where saying (A) is accurate'. It is most common for this structure to appear following either verbs or nouns, but may also occasionally follow adjectives. Coming primarily at the end of sentences, というところ will often be followed immediately by the auxiliary verb だ or です. Occasionally, という will be replaced by the past-tense form, といった. However, the meaning does not change at all in these cases. Caution というところ has a tendency to be used when the number being given is the theoretical maximum for something, rather than the theoretical minimum. Due to this, it may sound unnatural when wanting to present an approximate minimum."

Because of this, the expression is quite similar to 'being that' in English. The case marking particle で will be used after 理由 to show that 'with' or 'by means of' that reason, (B). Fun Fact Almost all cases where という 理由 で will be used may be replaced by というわけで. However, the reverse is not true. The reason that わけ may be used for 理由 , but 理由 cannot always be used for わけ (especially at the beginning of sentences) is because わけ is another way of reading the kanji for 理由 .

Despite the nuance being slightly different, といえども can be thought of as a very old-fashioned way of saying といっても. Due to といえども being old-fashioned, it is often used for emphasis and will frequently be paired with expressions like いくら, いかに, どんなに, etc. Fun Fact Although very rarely used, sometimes いえども is seen as 雖 も. In these cases the kanji 雖 , which means 'however', is simply paired with も. This creates a slight difference between 'however even (A)', and the more modern 'even if one were to say (A)'. Despite this, the meanings are used interchangeably in modern times."

However, unlike some other time expressions, とき is mainly used to express things that happen at regular intervals (habits, hobbies, etc.), or at broad times/individual events (when it rains, when there is a sale at the shop, etc.) Using とき is quite easy! You just need to attach it to the end of any independent word (verbs, nouns, or adjectives). As with most cases where a noun will be attached to another word in Japanese, we will also be required to use な after な-Adjectives , and の after nouns. The case-marking particle に will generally come directly after 時 , signifying that another verb is about to follow. Caution As discussed previously, ときに is primarily used to discuss when things happened. What this means is that it will not be used to highlight ongoing states that were true during the first action. For example 'the time you tripped over a log on Tuesday'. When とき is used, the nuance will be that it is describing one thing leading to another, rather than a static thing."

The literal translation of ところで is closer to 'and with that', and implies that something (within the previous topic) suddenly reminded the speaker of another thing (that happens to be a new topic). Caution When ところで appears after the past tense of a verb as たところで, it carries a different meaning, and will express that something isn't the case, despite (A).

When compared with structures like すでに and もう , とっくに will either indicate something that has happened much further in the past, or may be used simply for exaggeration. Fun-fact It is uncommon to see とっくに listed with an exact time, as the stem (old Japanese) word 疾 し already means something close to 'far earlier', or 'at a much earlier time'."

This is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the adverbial particle は, the neologism 比 べもの 'a comparable thing', the case-marking particle に, and the negated form of the う-Verb なる 'to become', ならない. This may seem like a lot, but it is just expressing that '(A) will not be a comparable thing'. This structure will be used before nouns, where that noun is the thing that cannot be compared. This is usually due to quality, quantity, or some other feature that is easily measurable. As this grammar pattern is emphatic, it will indicate that the difference between (A) and (B) is quite large, without specifically expressing the amount. Additionally, like in the final example, we can sometimes see the use of the adverbial particle は a second time before ならない. This just adds further emphasis or highlights contrast. Fun Fact As a reminder, a neologism is just a set word or phrase which has come to be used a certain way due to habits or customs. 比 べもの itself is just a mix of the conjunctive form of the る-Verb 比 べる 'to compare', and the noun もの 'thing'."

Due to this, とばかり simply indicates that while (A) is as described, it is not literally the case. とばかり can appear after almost any word, as the と is creating a quote. に will often follow ばかり when the sentence is going on to describe what is actually happening. とばかりに is an abbreviation of と 言 わんばかり 'to only just not be at the point where (A) is said', which itself will still be seen quite often. In this case, 言 わん is an abbreviation of 言 わぬ, making use of the classical auxiliary verb ぬ used for negation. Caution As とばかりに will be used to describe the way that something 'looks like it is about to say', it won't be used for describing the speaker themselves. However, it may occasionally be seen being used about the speaker if the sentence is in third person."

While となると may be seen in several different forms, the base structure is a combination of the particle と, the う-Verb なる 'to become', and the particle と repeated in its use of highlighting a certain outcome. Standard translations are 'once (A), (B)', and 'when (A), (B)'. A more literal translation can be thought of as 'once (A) happens, it is sure to follow that (B)'. The other forms that となると may be seen in are ともなると , となれば , and ともなれば . The primary difference being that も adds slight emphasis. While ば and と do have slightly different nuances by default, in terms of this specific grammar point, they are used completely interchangeably. となると may be seen following nouns, or verbs in any of their standard form . も may also be used following the subject of ともなると sentences, and simply places emphasis on that subject. Fun Fact The emphasis that is seen in this grammar pattern is partly due to the function of the first と, and is one of the reasons that になると will not be used to convey a similar meaning. に and と are regularly used in this way in Japanese, with と almost always indicating that the outcome of something is unavoidable, cannot be controlled, is as to be expected. に merely focuses on the transition from (A) to (B)."

This structure is used when the speaker is asking a question about whether someone will choose (A) or (B). It is only used when there are no more than two possible choices. As can be seen above, verbs may be used as part of this structure if they are nominalized with こと , or の . Additionally, the polite form does not specifically need to be used, and どっち may be used instead. The second と itself is quite often omitted, as どちら (or どっち) implies that both (A) and (B) are part of the same structure. Fun Fact As どちら is the polite speech form of 誰 , it is also frequently used as a polite way to ask questions about unknown people. Caution どちらのほう (or どっちのほう) may also be used, but this does not really change the overall nuance. It merely puts slightly more emphasis on the 'direction' of the choice. This is similar to expressions like 'which one are you leaning towards?' in English."

This way of using と can appear after almost any type of word (or phrase), but requires だ when used after nouns or な-Adjectives . と as a quotation marker will almost always be followed by a verb that shows what type of 'quote' it is. This can be words like 言 う, 思 う, 考 える, 聞 く, etc. However, at the end of a sentence, the verb will often be omitted. As with other instances of the particle と being used, this use simply expresses the relationship between (A) 'what was communicated', and (B) 'how it was communicated'."

Due to this, どうやら simply strengthens the uncertainty of things that the speaker is already unsure about. This is in a similar fashion to phrases like 'in some way it seems like (A)'. Like many adverbs that express amount or speculation, どうやら will appear at the beginning of sentences and modify the meaning of the entire phrase. Fun-fact While classified as a standalone adverb, どうやら is originally a combination of どう 'how' and やら, a 助詞 (particle) that is used for denoting uncertainty about singular things or lists. With this in mind, it is similar to the way that 'or whatever', or 'or some such' may be added to a sentence in English in order to emphasize that (A) is not certain."

This is a structure that is comprised of verbs in the negative form connected to で, は, and the negative-potential form of the る-Verb 居 る 'to be'. In this way it just means 'to be unable to be without (A)'. ないではいられない primarily expresses the inability of the speaker to tolerate (A) not happening, due to wanting to do it. It may also indicate that they will unfortunately do it despite knowing that they shouldn't. ないではいられない may also be used to highlight that in the situation of (A), some particular emotion, feeling, or reaction cannot be repressed. (B) is something that happens naturally as a consequence of (A)."

It is used when saying that something needs to be done a second time (usually due to the result/quality being insufficient the first time). To use 直 す , it will need to be attached to the ます stem form of any verb. With する verbs, the conjugation rules are slightly different. する will become し, and then 直 す will be connected in the regular fashion. In some situations, する may be replaced with やる (a very casual equivalent of する ). As やる is a う-Verb , it will be conjugated as やり 直 す . Caution 直 す (to fix) should not be confused with 治 す (to heal/mend). The kanji 直 literally means 'straight', or 'direct', and implies that one should 'straighten out' something."

This basically translates as 'difficult to dismiss', but is a bit closer to English expressions like 'nothing to scoff at', or 'not to be taken lightly'. Fun Fact なかなか highlights that something is 'considerably/extremely (A)', or 'far more (A) than expected'. If we imagine a dartboard, where the whole board shows the intensity level of a specific word, and なかなか represents the bullseye, this is basically the nuance. '(A) is the middle (bullseye) example of (B)'. Fun Fact なかなか, coming from the kanji 中 meaning 'within', can be thought to mean the 'middle' or 'most' (A)."

It may appear as either なしには, なしでは, or なくしては , with little variation in meaning. It is a combination of the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective ない, なく, the conjunction particle して, which highlights the word before it as a condition from which a determination can be made, and the adverbial particle は. As the second part of なくしては sentences will also be negative, we can see the more literal meaning of 'from the lack of (A), a lack of (B) can be determined'. This 'determination' comes across quite strongly, and may be interpreted as '(B) is impossible without (A)'. なくしては will appear after either nouns, or phrases that have been nominalized with こと. As mentioned previously, なしには and なしでは may also be seen. These are just the noun 無 し 'without', paired with either of the particle combinations には or では. なくしては is the most formal of the three. The (B) part of なくしては sentences will almost always be some state of completion or desirable outcome that cannot be achieved without (A)."

However, this is where the similarities end. なくてはならない is an example of a double negative in Japanese, and actually has the meaning '(A) must be done', or 'must do (A)'. While this grammar point is usually translated as 'must do', the literal translation is 'must not, not do (A)'. This double 'not' is where many learners have difficulties. ならない simply means 'cannot become', and comes from the negative form of なる . To use this structure, simply create the negative form of a verb, and then convert ない to なく (the conjunctive form of an い-Adjective ), followed by て . After this, は is added, and then finally ならない . ならない is considered to be the most formal structure out of ならない , いけない , and だめ. It is regularly used in formal writing, or semi-formal/formal speech. いけない (the most common variation) and だめ (the most casual variation) are also acceptable in many situations. Caution The ては in なくては is often shortened to ちゃ, as this is easier to say. なくちゃ may then be followed by ならない . However, due to ならない being quite formal, なくちゃ (a casual structure) will not be used with ならない on a regular basis. It is more common to see なくちゃ paired with いけない , or だめ. These casual structures are very similar to words like 'gotta' in English."

When that is the case, が, は, or sometimes even に may be between なくはない and the noun. Additionally, the は in なくはない is interchangeable with も, with only a slight strengthening of the nuance when も is used. This structure often appears with the potential form of verbs, in order to show that something is not impossible, despite appearances or what one may think."

However, in the polite form, instead of る changing to り (as would be expected of a う-Verb ), it will change to い instead. Caution Although some Japanese speakers will use it, expressions like なさって いらっしゃる are considered double keigo ( なさる is honorific language , and いらっしゃる is also honorific language ), and are technically incorrect. However, なさる may be partnered with ます, which is simply polite speech .

Due to the way that しも alters まだ, a more literal translation of this grammar point can be thought of as 'if it's (A), then of course there's still that, but as for (B)'. Fun Fact しも is a classical particle that is not frequently used in modern times outside of set phrases or expressions like ならまだしも , 今 しも 'right this moment', and だれしも 'absolutely anybody'. In all cases, it merely strengthens the word directly before it."

(B) is usually something that is surprising, and brought about by a strong sense of will or emotion. Additionally, なり is almost always used in relation to other people, rather than oneself.

However, depending on the type of word used, conjugation rules will differ slightly. For な-Adjectives , they will always need to be followed by な , when used before a noun. This means that adjective (A) is describing qualities/features of noun (B). Caution Many words can take either な or の when describing a noun. The difference in meaning is usually clear. Let's take a look at both nuances. (A) な (B) means that - (A) is a quality/feature of (B) (A) の (B) means that - (A) is the type/purpose of (B) To avoid making this mistake when using な-Adjectives to describe a noun, it can be helpful to think about whether you are describing a 'quality', or the 'purpose' of something."

This structure is a combination of に, and the う-Verb 当 たる 'to hit', or 'to come into contact' in either its formal-conjunctive form or て-form. に 当 たり will appear following verbs in their dictionary form, or nouns. There are two primary nuances that this structure will be used for, so let's look at a few examples of each. The first is when (A) is some sort of special occasion or condition from which (B) will be done. The second is when (A) is some sort of goal or target for which (B) will be the means or measures in response to that goal.

This structure may be seen with verbs or adjectives in either their dictionary or negative forms, or with nouns in their dictionary form. Frequently the same word is repeated in both the positive and the negative, or grouped with かどうか in order to strengthen the 'whether (A) or not (A)' nuance. As the literal meaning of this structure is 'without being influenced by (A), (B)', or 'without being affected by (A), (B)', the primary nuance is on the fact that (B) is something that exists or will happen without consideration for (A). Due to this, に 関 わらず may also be used to show that 'any type of (A) will result in the same (B)'."

Despite the English translations, this particular use of the imperative form of する translates more accurately to 'so it's (A), who cares!', as the speaker is just strongly stating that the actual condition of (A) is unimportant in the overall sentence. When repeated, にせよ～にせよ illustrates that regardless of either '(A) or (B), (C) is still true'.

Caution Although not grammatically incorrect, it is quite unnatural to mix the use of にしろ with にせよ . Due to this, when using this pattern, it will be important to repeat the same exact expression.

                        "content": "にする is a structure that combines the に particle (a location/target), with the verb する . It means to 'make/decide' something in a certain way. The nuance with にする is that the speaker has direct control over the outcome. This is where the strong feeling of 'choice' comes from. The noun that comes before にする is the thing that is being decided. In this example, although the common translation is 'to decide', it is actually much closer to the slang expression 'to do (A)' in English. This means that the literal translation is actually 'I'll do a beer', or 'I'll make it a beer'. Sometimes the particle と is used instead of に. Although this has the same meaning, it changes the nuance slightly. When と is used, it takes away the feeling of being a direct decision. とする tends to be used in more formal situations, but this is only because と is less 'definite', so results in the phrase sounding less pushy. If you were going to compare these two to an English equivalent, it would be similar to the difference between the following sentences. に - I'll buy a burger. (A burger is the direct target of 'buy') と - I'll go with a burger. (You aren't 'going' anywhere, it just sounds softer) This grammar point may be used for more abstract nouns, and does not specifically need to be 'items'."

When using につけ , the most common translation will be that something is happening 'every (A)', or 'whenever (A)'. In the (B) part of the sentence, the thoughts or feelings of the speaker will often be expressed in relation to (A). Additionally, (B) will always be something that is thought to happen naturally due to (A). This structure may appear with either verbs or nouns in their dictionary forms. It is also possible to see につけて , but the abbreviated form is far more common. Caution This is considered a fairly old-fashioned grammar structure, so will mostly only be seen in literature or shows that are emphasizing a specific time period."

This is a combination of the case marking particle に, the adverbial particle は, and the negative form of the う-Verb 当 たる 'to strike', or 'to be on the mark', 当 たらない. Due to this, the literal meaning can be thought of as 'it's not on the mark to (A)'. には 当 たらない will appear directly after verbs in their dictionary form , or する verbs either with or without the する. Additionally, the は may occasionally be omitted, without any change in meaning. Rather than implying that something is 'way off', には 当 たらない most often simply highlights that a particular situation is not to the extent where (A) would be appropriate. (A) itself is regularly a verb that relates to reactions or feelings. Some examples include 驚 く 'to be surprised', 非難 'to reproach', 称賛 'to admire', 感心 'to be impressed', 喜 ぶ 'to rejoice', and other similar words."

It is usually translated as 'surrounding (A)', 'associated with (A)', or 'connected to (A)'. In most cases, まつわる will be both preceded and followed by a noun, with the preceding noun being the topic, and the following noun being the thing that is dealing with that topic. まつわる itself is primarily seen when (B) is some sort of information or explanation related to (A). Because of this, 話 'tale', 物語 'story', 伝説 'legend', 神話 'myth', and similar words will often appear as (B). Fun Fact 纏 わる shares the same kanji as 纏 まる, another common verb that means 'to come together', or 'to consolidate'. Although the kanji itself is rarely used outside of books, it may help to remember the nuance being conveyed in まつわる of 'coming together'. This 'coming together around (A)', or simply 'surrounding (A)' translates the feeling of the structure quite accurately."

Being that it is composed of the case-marking particle に, adverbial particle も, the noun 程 'bounds', and がある 'to have', the more literal meaning of 'there are bounds even within (A)' also carries the critical nuance of the more standard translations. This structure may follow almost any word type in their standard form s. Caution Despite being used negatively in the vast majority of situations, there are instances where にも 程 がある will be used positively with adjectives such as かわいい 'cute' or うまい 'delicious'. In sentences like this, the grammar structure is being used jokingly to express admiration or approval."

Acts as the separation point between the (A) and (B) parts of a sentence. Made up of the case marking particle に , and the う - Verb よる in its て form. による - Generally used at the end of a sentence, to highlight that the previous statement depends on (A). により - Almost always used before a comma. Acts as the separation point between the (A) and (B) parts of a sentence. Made up of the case marking particle に , and the う - Verb よる in its conjunctive form . To use any of these constructions, attach them to the end of a noun that you want to express as being the 'dependent' thing. Caution による may also sometimes be followed by a noun. In these cases, it will become a verb modified noun, and highlight that (B) resulted from (A). Fun Fact Although よる is almost always written in hiragana, there are several different kanji that use this reading. They all share similar meanings. Learn more about this in the によると grammar point."

In all of these meanings, the base interpretation of 'to accompany' is being highlighted. As 'accompanying' does not specifically indicate that (A) is controlling (B), this grammar structure may be used simply to indicate things that happen at the same time, rather than when something is being directly caused by the first. However, (A) having a strong influence on the change of (B) is usually implied. に 伴 う may also appear directly before another noun when it is being modified by the verb. に 伴 って is used both for events that are progressively changing at the same time, and momentary events that cause a sudden change."

Often, this structure will be translated as 'in addition to (A), (B)', or 'not only (A), but also (B). Being that it is a formal phrase, に 加 えて will also often appear in its formal-conjunctive form に 加 え . To use にくわえて , simply place it directly after the noun that you would like to highlight as being the base information, before discussing what exactly is 'in addition' to that base in the following clause. Both the kanji and hiragana forms of this structure are fairly common, so it will be beneficial to remember both. Caution にくわえて is frequently used when (B) is something that is in addition to (A) in respect to magnifying what was already true of (A). This just means that it will often be used to highlight something being brought about by (B) that would not be possible with just (A) by itself. This increase may be either positive or negative."

These may seem quite different, but we will examine the similarities shortly. To use に 当 たる , attach it to the end of an (A) noun that you would like to mark as being the 'point of reference'. (B) may come directly after に 当 たる , or earlier in the sentence, so long as it is clearly separated from (A). As for the link between に 対 して and に 当 たる , it is as follows. In に 対 して, (A) and (B) exist simultaneously, but (B) opposes something about (A). に 当 たる , (A) and (B) exist simultaneously, but (B) matches something about (A). Due to this, unless the speaker is specifically trying to highlight something that is 'opposing', or 'matching', the base meaning of '(A) and (B) existing simultaneously' may be the standard translation."

This comparative meaning aims to illustrate (B) from the perspective of (A), and usually refers to situations, level of experience, or something similar. To use this structure, attach the case-marking particle に to the end of a noun, then follow it with 照 らして. If a second noun will be modified directly, then 照 らした will be used instead. Keep in mind that the に in this structure is marking (A) as the 'doer' of 照 らす 'to illuminate', as it is a transitive verb. This means that the structure has a more literal translation of '(B) as reflected by (A)'. This can also be thought of as 'as made clear by (A), (B)', 'as made evident by (A), (B)'. (B) will almost always be a judgment that is logically based on (A)."

Common translations include 'only when (A), did (B)', and 'going as far as to (A), (B)'.

As with many other grammar structures that use verbs, occasionally the formal conjunctive 至 り will replace the standard て-form 至 って.

This means that the negative form of 足 る is 足 らない, not 足 りない.

Despite the more literal translation of 'when (A) comes to pass', に 際 して will often just be interpreted as 'on the occasion of (A)', or 'at the time of (A)'. This is a formal grammar pattern that is seen connected either to nouns, or verbs in their dictionary form. Caution While there are many similarities between 際 に and に 際 して , a few key differences exist. The first being that に 際 して is primarily used when (B) is something that will be done before (A), or when presented with the situation of (A). However, in the case of 際 に , the nuance is more specifically 'on the occasion of (A)', marking the exact point in time, rather than the approach to that time. Following on from this example, because に 際 して highlights the approach to a specific situation, it will never appear connected to verbs in the past tense. 際 に , on the other hand, frequently appears with verbs in the past tense, as it can highlight the 'occasion' of an action being complete."

Alternatively, it may just be used for artistic expression, or to make a character seem 'classical'. In the case that the verb being negated is いる, the old fashion おる will be modified to おらぬ instead.

This particular expression is used with the plain ( dictionary ) form of verbs only. In these examples, we can see that there is no difference between Ichidan verbs and Godan verbs . Both will be used in their plain forms. In this expression, のが is performing the same function as in the regular のは or のが construction. This function is nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun). However, のは may not be used with this phrase, as が will always appear with adjectives. Caution If you want to express that you liked doing something (in the past), the verb will still remain in the plain form, but 好 き will change to past tense. This construction can also be used to ask questions about what other people like. This is done through the addition of か ."

The connection that ので makes between (A), and (B), is similar to から , meaning that it is often translated as 'because', or 'since'. When used after な-Adjectives or nouns, な must precede ので . When used as 'since', ので puts emphasis on the sentence as a whole, or on the effects caused. It then examines those reasons objectively (in a way that is based on facts, rather than feelings or opinions). から tends to be more subjective, and can sound much more vague when used as 'because'. We can see here that から is not quite as strong as ので . This relates back to the base meaning of から being ' from ', rather than ' because '. Caution ので can sometimes be seen as んで , which is a more casual variation. Also, unlike many grammar points that connect to verbs, ので may be used with the ます form. This is something that is unique to conjunction particles."

As with many conjunction particles, な will be required after a noun/ な-Adjective , but before のに . It is also possible to see だ のに , instead of なのに , but this is something that is only seen in certain dialects, and would be considered incorrect by the vast majority of native speakers. Fun Fact Regardless of having two quite different translations ('despite', and 'in order to'), のに always functions in the same way. In the situation of '(A) のに , (B)', (B) is/will be the result. The only difference between how the nuance will be read, is whether the (B) statement is a logical conclusion, or an illogical one. When logical, the meaning is usually 'in order to', when 'illogical', the meaning is usually 'despite'."

This phrase is made up of the following parts: のは - Used for nominalization (creating a noun phrase). は highlights contrast between two (or more) elements. の 方 - A combination of の, the case marking particle , and 方 , a noun meaning 'side', or 'direction'. だ (or です ) - The auxiliary verb used for 'determining' something. The literal meaning of this grammar point is something similar to 'that which is (A), is on the side of (B)'. By saying that something is on the 'side' of (B), it comes across more gently than expressly stating that it 'is (B)'. To use this construction, attach のは to the end of a phrase, and then follow it with a noun + の 方 だ. Note that のは will become なのは if the final word before のは is a noun. Fun Fact This phrase is often used apologetically, to express that someone feels that they are the individual who is (more) responsible (for causing a certain outcome)."

Like the auxiliary verb そうだ , ようだ may be used in a similar way to な-Adjectives (can be followed by な when acting as an adjective, or に when acting as an adverb). の is required before these constructions when it is describing a noun. Because よう (coming from the kanji 様 ) usually expresses the 'manner' in which something is existing/happening, it is regularly used when the speaker has direct personal experience from which they are drawing a comparison. This means that よう will sound far more confident than みたい , or そう . Fun Fact When ようだ is describing another word (in its ような , or ように form), this is known as 'presenting an example' ( 例示 in Japanese), and means that '(A) is an example of (B)'."

However, this use of 疎 か is not seen much in modern Japanese, and the word will mainly be used in set expressions where it doesn't behave exactly as a な-Adjective usually would. Despite this, the meaning of 'alienation', or 'completely removed from' is kept in はおろか , as it simply means 'completely putting aside (A), (B)'. Common translations include 'let alone (A), (B)', and 'it's needless to say that (A), when (B)'. (B) and (A) will usually be things that fall into the same category, where (B) is considered the far more obvious of the two. Due to this obviousness, (B) will often be immediately followed by the adverbial particle さえ. This shows that (B) is the noteworthy minimum extent. Alternatively, さえ may be exchanged with other adverbial particles that fill a similar purpose such a も, すら, or まで. In most cases, は 疎 か sentences tend to have a fairly negative nuance."

This means that it expresses something that the speaker is 'quite sure is true', but cannot confirm. The most common translations of はず are 'bound to be (A)', and 'should be (A)'. As はず is a noun, it may be used in any place that a noun would usually be used. It will often be followed by だ , or です . Caution Despite はず sometimes being translated as 'should', this is only when you think that something 'should be true', and cannot be used when making suggestions/giving advice. Due to this, 'bound' is the more accurate translation of 筈 , in almost all situations. Fun Fact The だ (or です ) in はずだ may be omitted. This usually makes はず sound a little less certain, like 'bound to be (A)... probably'. In the same way, speakers may sometimes add はず to the end of their sentences in a similar way to 多分 , in order to show that they are not 100% certain about whether what they just said is accurate or not."

Often, (A) will be something that is considered obvious, or the most well known information in regard to the topic. はもとより may appear after nouns, or verb phrases that have been nominalized with の or こと. Alternatively, はもとより may be used in structures where it is simply showing that (A) is the base from which (B) is also a fact. Although this may sound similar to the previous meaning, it translates closer to 'from the start, (A) is (B)', or 'by nature, (A) is (B)'. Which meaning is being used will usually be clear in the context of the overall sentence."

                        "content": "When paired with the case marking particle に , ばかり regularly conveys the meaning of 'simply because', or 'just because'. Literally, this expression means that 'even with just (A), (B) is/was able to occur'. This phrase is regularly paired with the past form of verbs, indicating that something that has already taken place, led to some other result. To use ばかりに , simply attach the expression to the end of any word in its attributive form . It should be noted that this particular grammar pattern has a strong tendency to be used with results that are negative. However, this is not a requirement. A high level of eagerness/enthusiasm can also be expressed when paired with grammar points like たい, or ほしい. Fun Fact As we mention in our ばかり grammar point, one of the more common kanji that ばかり stems from is '許', which means to be 'let off' or 'let through'. It implies a minimum amount of something that is then deemed as 'permissible'. This nuance is kept in ばかりに, as the (A) part of the sentence is being highlighted as that minimum extent of something for which the (often surprising) result of (B) is/was possible. Due to this, translations such as 'even with only/just (A), (B)' are quite similar to ばかりに, so long as it is clear that (A) is surprising. Fun Fact The kanji that is used most frequently for ばかり is the same kanji that is used for 許 す 'to forgive'. In this particular use of 許, it still means 'to let off', or 'to let through', as 'to forgive' quite often has the nuance of letting something through/pass/slide."

Literally, it just highlights that 'if it is (A), then the limit of (A) will be controlled only by its extent'. To use ば～ほど, ば will be paired with the hypothetical form of any verb/ い-Adjective (or noun/ な-Adjective with なら on the end), before the same word will be repeated in its attributive form . After this, a (B) part of the sentence will highlight what the expected result of (A) is. As である (the formal version of だ ) may replace な with な-Adjectives (or なら with nouns), sometimes である will be used instead of な/なら, in regard to both nouns and な-Adjectives . Caution When this expression is used with する verbs, the noun that する is linked to in the ば part of the sentence does not need to be repeated in the ほど part. Fun Fact Sometimes, the ば 'hypothetical' part of the sentence will be omitted altogether, leaving ほど to perform a similar function by itself."

This use of ふう appears following verbs, and works in the same way as a な-Adjective. This means that it will be followed by に when being used adverbially to further describe something that is being done 'in the way of (A)'. Also, it is common for ふうに to be used after pre-noun adjectival words such as こんな, そんな, and あんな. This just highlights that something is being done 'like this', 'like that', etc. Fun-fact For ease of remembering, coming from the kanji for 風 'wind', ふう can be thought of as similar to English phrases like 'to have an air of (A)', etc. However, this is just a tool for memorization, as the overlap in meaning is not 100%."

In many cases, the particles に and へ are interchangeable, but there is a slight difference in meaning. へ focuses more on the distance/effort required to get between (A) and (B), while に focuses more on the connection between (A) and (B). へ always comes after the noun signifying the destination. In these examples, while they may seem the same at first glance, へ shows that there is a space between (A) and (B), while に puts the emphasis solely on the destination. This is why common expressions such as 'city/country name へ ようこそ' sound very polite. It is like saying 'Welcome, and we acknowledge your journey/effort to get here'. In the TV-show example, this commonly means 'thank you for your effort to watch this particular show, out of all the ones you could have chosen'."

(A) and (B) will be the same verb repeated. The literal meaning of 'as determined with the purpose of (A)' may also be used if it helps to remember the nuance. This expression is quite formal, so will rarely be heard in daily speech. Fun Fact As mentioned in other grammar patterns that contain variations of べく such as べき and べし, this structure derives from the kanji 可 , which is usually translated as 'permissible' or 'allowed'. All 可 really indicates is a situation that does not currently exist, but it certain to come about as a part of the most logical course of events."

As with many other adverbs that highlight an 'amount' in Japanese, ほとんど can modify a whole phrase, or can be used before の , to further specify a single noun. In negative sentences, ほとんど translates as 'hardly any'. This is mainly due to the 'full group' that ほとんど is describing being highlighted as almost 'not' existing."

Adding the particle か to this expression simply changes the nuance from 'let's', to 'shall we?', and is more of a direct question than ましょう by itself. Like ましょう , this expression can be added to the ます stem form of any verb. One thing to note with these examples is that they are 'suggestions', not 'invitations'. In Japanese there is a slight difference between the two, in the same way that there is in English. If you want to invite someone to do something, the most natural way would be to use ませんか , a phrase that is similar to ましょうか . The difference here is that 'won't you do (A)?' has a stronger nuance of being a direct invitation, while ましょうか is closer to just 'let's do (A)!'"

The reason that Japanese only requires one word for both of these nuances is due to まだ literally meaning 'something is unexpectedly still going'. From these sentences, we can see that まだ may be translated in each case as the following. (Non-past) - Although (A) is expected to not be there/happening, it is. 'Still' in English. (ている) - Although (A) is expected to not still be going, it is. 'Not yet' in English. The negative form of this will be discussed more in まだ～ていません . This is the opposite of もう , which means 'something is unexpectedly finished'. まだ may also be used to ask questions. This is when the speaker thinks that something 'might' be continuing, but wants or needs to confirm. Fun Fact まだ is often used simply as an expression indicating that something is 'lacking', or 'not yet' where it needs to be. In these cases まだ is frequently repeated as まだまだ, for emphasis."

One of these ways is through the use of the な-Adjective , みたい . みたい can be used after any word that a な-Adjective would usually follow, to express that something is 'like (A)', or 'similar to (A)'. In the above examples, we can see that みたい should always be followed by だ (or です ) when it is at the end of a statement, however, this is frequently omitted. みたい is also often used to describe another noun, but needs to be followed by な in these cases. In this type of sentence, it is just expressing that something is '(B), but resembles (A)'. みたい is used most often in conversational situations, and is based on direct, reliable information. It is far less formal than its counterpart, ようだ . Caution Despite みたい meaning 'to resemble', and being based on (usually) visual stimulus, it should not be confused with 見 たい 'to want to see'. This is a common mistake that learners make, as みたい itself does not have a kanji form. Fun Fact みたいだ is originally an abbreviation of the more formal phrase を見た ような . As a result of this, we can see that ようだ kept its formal meaning, while みたい became the casual equivalent."

It is often translated as 'perhaps', 'maybe', or 'possibly'. As with many other Japanese adverbs, it will often appear at the beginning of sentences. Due to もしかしたら presenting hypothetical situations, かもしれない will regularly appear in the same sentence (although it is not required).

It is a combination of the noun もの 'thing', and the adverbial particle use of か for conveying 'doubt' or 'uncertainty'. Common translations include 'definitely not (A)', 'absolutely not (A)', and 'do you really think that (A)'. Literally, the meaning is quite close to 'as if' in English, as ものか just poses a strong question to which the speaker already completely disagrees with. ものか may appear after any word that could attach to もの, such as a verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns followed by な. Other forms which may be seen are もんか , もんですか , and ものですか , with women being more traditionally likely to use the もんですか and ものですか variants. Additionally, when following the た form of verbs, ものか will imply that the speaker cannot bear for (A) to eventuate, due to evaluating it as something highly negative. Caution There are several other situations in where ものか will be used, but in each of them it may be easiest to think of the primary translation as being 'as if (A)', as it merely implies the speakers shock or disbelief in relation to whatever conditions are presented in the previous statement. These 'conditions' may involve an amount, possibility, or result of (A)."

Common translations include 'because (A)', and 'the reason is (A)'. ものですから may appear directly after verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns that are followed with な. Occasionally, ものですから will be abbreviated to もので , or もんで , without any change in the overall meaning. The change of だ to its conjunctive form で indicates that there is something coming after, despite the fact that what comes after may sometimes be omitted if it is obvious. Despite the slight difference in emphasis, ものだから and ものですから can be thought of as a single interchangable grammar structure in most situations. Fun-fact Although it is not a rule, ものですから will primarily be used when explaining one's actions, as a way of emphasizing that the situation of (A) specifically led to the speaker doing (B)."

However, it is primarily used when the speaker is trying to convey their displeasure at the result of (B), due to (A) being something that by all means should have happened. ものを will be translated as 'if only (A)', or '(A), but (B)'. Despite being a construction of もの and the adverbial particle を, ものを is often considered as a standalone conjunction particle . It can be seen following verbs or い-Adjectives in their standard form , or な-Adjectives followed by な. As can be seen in the above examples, ものを is almost always preceded by hypothetical structures such as ば at some point leading up to its use. Caution ものを will often be seen at the end of sentences, with what would have come after it being left unspoken. In these cases, the important information is still there, as the (A) part of the sentence will always highlight what the ideal result was. Because of this, it can be safely assumed that the speaker is just frustrated that (A) didn't happen. Fun Fact The adverbial particle を is often used this way in Japanese, where no specific action is linked to it. In these situations it usually just indicates an ideal or goal to which the method of achieving it (the verb that would usually be attached to を) is omitted. ものを can be thought of as an extension of this in literally meaning 'to that which was (A)', with 'I wish it had happened' being unsaid."

Sometimes, やすい has a translation that is a bit closer to 'prone to (A)', or 'likely to (A)' in English. This nuance is regularly seen when the verb is related to emotions. Caution There is another adjective 安 い that has the meaning of 'cheap'. This kanji should never be used with verbs to mean 'easy'. Most of the time, やすい itself will be written in hiragana, and usage of 易 い is quite limited. Fun Fact Although 易 い is an い-Adjective , it is almost never used by itself (when not attached to verbs). In such cases, it is much more natural to use the な-Adjective 簡単 ."

When attaching う to う-Verbs , simply replace the last kana with the equivalent お sound kana from within the same column (く becomes こ, う becomes お, す becomes そ, etc.), before adding う . For る-Verbs , replace る with よう . As with many other verb conjugations, する and くる behave in a slightly different way to regular う-Verbs and る-Verbs . する will become し よう , while くる will become こ よう . The type of statements that う , and よう can be used for in Japanese are usually divided into three categories. 推量 - Expresses guesses (has a similar meaning to だろう , which itself is the よう form of だ ) 意志 - Expresses intentions (has a similar meaning to ～するつもりだ ) 勧誘 - Expresses invitations or encouragement (has a similar meaning to 誘 う 'to invite') Caution Although よう is used with る-Verbs , する , and くる , it should not be confused with ようだ , another auxiliary verb that is used when describing likeness (in a similar way to そうだ )."

This use is known as 推定 (presumption) in Japanese. However, despite being a presumption/assumption, らしい usually sounds relatively confident. らしい is regularly translated as 'it seems like (A)', or 'I heard that (A)'. To use らしい , attach it to end of any (non-polite) verb, adjective, or noun. In these examples, らしい indicates that the speaker has some reason to believe that (A) is true. This could be that they heard, saw, or read something, but are still not 100% sure whether their understanding is correct or not. In this way, it sounds very similar to 'it appears as though (A)' in English. Caution There are 2 main forms of らしい in Japanese. The auxiliary verb usage mentioned above, and the 形容詞 の 一部 (auxiliary adjective), a type of adjective that must be attached to another word for it to have any meaning usage. らしい has the meaning of something that is 'typical of (A)', when used as an auxiliary adjective. This い-Adjective use of らしい will be covered more in our second らしい lesson."

This is regularly translated as 'there is no way that (A)', or 'it is impossible that (A)'. However, as mentioned in other わけ lessons, わけ is used very similarly to 'so' in English, so may also be thought of as 'it is SO not (A)', with 'so' being used for emphasis. In this structure, わけ is combined with the case marking particle が, and the い-Adjective ない. わけがない may be used with verbs, or adjectives in their attributive form . Caution Compared to わけではない, わけがない is much stronger, and emphasizes the 'non-existence' of something. This can be thought of as similar to the difference between 'it is so that it isn't (A)' (for わけではない), and 'it is SO not (A)' (for わけがない ). 'It is so that it isn't (A)' highlights that (A) is a thing that exists, but not in the way of (A). On the other hand, 'it is SO not (A)' highlights that no part of (A) whatsoever can be considered to be correct/accurate."

It may be translated as 'expressly', 'especially', or 'to go out of one's way to (A)'. わざわざ will usually be used at the beginning of sentences, before some statement will be made about an activity that was intentionally done. わざわざ has a tendency to be used positively, although it may be used with negative connotations as well. Fun Fact Although almost never used, 態態 may be seen in this kanji form. 態 is a kanji used to express 'purpose', or 'intent'. Generally, it refers to someone's 'willingness' to do something. As such, わざわざ just expresses that (A) is something that the speaker has as a strong goal. How it will be translated depends more on whether the actual result is positive, negative, or undecided. Positive result - To purposefully do (A), with the result of (A). Negative result - To have every intention of (A), with the actual result of (B). Undecided result - To be intent on (A), with (A) hopefully happening. Caution わざと is a construction that comes from the same kanji as わざわざ. わざと generally only conveys 'on purpose', while わざわざ has many more potential meanings (due to being stronger)."

This is a combination of を , the noun 元 'origin', and に . The literal meaning is similar to 'with (A) as the origin, (B)', and is used primarily to reference a source from which something is created or started. Most of the time, をもとに will be written without kanji, but it is also possible to see it as を 元 に . As this grammar pattern is mainly used to highlight an origin of creation, it will often be seen in sentences that use verbs like 書 く 'to write', できる 'to be able', and 作 る 'to make'. Caution - を 元 に 'based on' differs to に 基 づいて 'based on', in that に 基 づいて indicates a foundation from which the judgement or conclusion of (B) is made, while を 元 に focuses more on being a source of inspiration for (B), or enabling (B)."

It is used in a similar way to the case-marking particle で, and will be translated as 'with (A)', 'by (A)', 'via (A)', or 'by means of (A)'. As this structure is preceded by the particle を, it will only be used directly following nouns, or noun phrases. Despite being similar to で in meaning, をもって will generally not be used in regard to simple methods of doing something, such as 'traveling by train'. Due to this, the translation of 'by means of' is the most accurate, as it would only be used in situations where the speaker is trying to emphasize the means, like in English. In addition to this, it is not often used with concrete items, such as a fork or a hammer, but instead will appear alongside abstract concepts, like 'with sincerity', or 'with compassion'. Fun Fact をもってすれば is a commonly occuring pattern, and may be translated as 'going off the assumption that it were with (A)'."

Because of this, the combination of the adverbial particle を, and 踏 まえる in its て-form can frequently be translated as 'considering (A)', or 'keeping (A) in mind'. を 踏 まえて is primarily used in formal situations where (B) is an action being undertaken with (A) as the premise. As this structure begins with を, it will need to follow a noun. In this grammar pattern, the literal meaning of を 踏 まえて as 'being firmly planted' can be used equally as naturally, so long as its figurative nature is kept in mind."

It will usually just be translated as 'don't do (A)', or 'you mustn't (A)'. んじゃない is almost always used from a higher position toward someone of a lower status. It may be used when the speaker is angry, but not always. んじゃない is a combination of the case-marking particle の, and the abbreviated form of ではない, じゃない. It will connect to the dictionary form of verbs. Despite being slang, the slightly more formal version んじゃありません can also be seen occasionally. This variation is common when the speaker wants to forbid something, but not sound angry, such as when an adult is talking to a child. The more literal translation of Verb + んじゃない is just 'it's not (verb)'. This sounds a bit strange in English, but might be similar to something like 'you're not (verb)', where a person is directly telling another what they shouldn't do. It is also common to see the abbreviated ている form, てん, before じゃない. Caution When used in the past tense, んじゃなかった indicates that something 'should not have been done', and has a nuance of regret or disappointment that the action occurred. Caution When んじゃない comes at the end of a sentence, it will be important to listen to the intonation, as the statement may actually be a question. In this case, it is an abbreviation of んじゃないか. The difference between these two uses of んじゃない will usually be very clear. A question has a rising intonation, while an order will have a dropping intonation."

The literal meaning of いったい is 'one body', or 'one form'. In this way, when paired with questions, いったい can be thought of meaning 'in a way that can be understood, what is (A)', or 'in a way that makes sense, what is (A)'. Fun Fact Like the 'one body', or 'one form' meaning mentioned above, 一体 is sometimes used to mean 'in general', or 'generally' when seen as 一体 に. However, this use is slowly becoming less common, partly due to how often 一体 is used simply to express surprise or shock."

This grammar point is used in a similar way to its literal meaning, which is 'with the above/previous (A), (B)'. 上 as 'above', and で as 'with', in で's use as a case marking particle . 上 で is a structure that is primarily used in formal settings. Due to this, it will not be used in casual conversations very often. It also strongly hints at (A) being a requirement for (B), or (A) being something that would logically be expected before (B). Caution Due to 上 で being used to show logical progressions from (A) to (B), (A) cannot be a verb that is passive. Passivity in Japanese often implies that someone/thing has a lack of control in relation to the actions that happen to them/it. As a result of this, (A) not being able to be controlled would result in (B) sounding like it could not be planned for. This is different to the way that passivity works in English (simply showing that something received an action upon it)."

However, the literal translation of ‘in line with (A)’ also works just as well in many cases. Caution Although 並 み may occasionally have the meaning of ‘as standard for (A)’ as a suffix, the ‘average’ or ‘ordinary’ meaning is often reserved for when 並 み is used by itself as a noun. In these cases it will usually be written as 並 , and be followed by the case-marking particle の, and then a second noun marking what the average is. Caution 並 み may only be used in sentences where (A) has a standard or norm that is well recognized, or easily identifiable. In cases where the ‘norm’ would change based on an individual’s opinion, rather than what the actual standard is, it will sound unnatural."

Being a mix of the substitute noun 何 'what', or 'whatever', と, the て-form of the う-Verb 言 う 'to say', and も, the literal meaning is also 'even whatever one can say (A)'. 何 といっても is used primarily at the beginning of sentences, and frequently highlights something that is a positive aspect of (A). Like many uses of 何 , the pronunciation change to 何 is simply for ease of speech. Despite being used mainly in positive situations, 何 といっても may occasionally appear with a negative nuance as well, although this is far less common."

Literally, it is closer to 'completely not (A)', or 'entirely not (A)', coming from the kanji 全 's meaning of 'whole'. Like many other adverbs, まったく may be used at the beginning of a sentence, or directly before the word that it is describing as being 'not at all' (A). It is common to see this expression using both the kanji form, and plain hiragana form of 全 く, so both should be learned early. Caution まったく is very similar to 全然 , another grammar point that is used to highlight the complete lack of something. However, まったく tends to sound a little bit more serious, and is therefore more likely to be used in formal writing/situations. 全然 on the other hand is far more common in casual speech."

Caution 合 う may also be used to in regard to sports/contests. In these cases, it may seem like players are not doing the action 'for' each other, but involvement from both sides is required to make the act possible."

                        "content": "In Japanese, there are numerous ways to express an order, command, or instruction. The most direct, abrasive, and therefore least used method is called the imperative form , which happens to be one of the basic conjugations of verbs. Without particles following it, the imperative form is fairly uncommon in daily life, but will often be seen on traffic signs, posters, or banners. In addition, it can be also heard shouted at demonstrations, when cheering at sports events, or in urgent situations, such as an officer yelling at a suspect to stop. Verbs are conjugated into the imperative form in the following way. For う-Verbs, simply replace the last kana of any verb with the equivalent え sound kana from the same row. For る-Verbs, replace る with either ろ or よ. The imperative form may sometimes be softened with the particle よ . This is a pattern which is mostly used by men that are familiar with each other, in order to offer advice or encouragement. Women tend to use the more polite て-form of verbs instead. Any verb except for ある and いる may be conjugated to the imperative form, due to their meanings being based on existence and nothing more. Fun Fact The なさい , polite imperative that comes from なさる is mostly used by teachers and parents talking to their children. It is also often used in instructions on  test papers. When speaking to animals, the polite prefix お plus the ます-stem will also occasionally be used. Fun Fact Originally, よ was used instead of ろ with る-Verbs. Despite this, with time it has been gradually losing popularity, and nowadays it is considered to be a more formal, written variant."

Due to 始末 being used to highlight negative outcomes that are the result of going through a specific event, it will often appear in sentences that also include words like とうとう ‘to come to a head’, 挙 げ 句 ‘after a long process’, or 結局 ‘in the end’. It may seem redundant to include these phrases, but as 始末 has the more literal translation of ‘to culminate in’ (including everything from beginning to end), it is more emphatic, rather than redundant."

Let's have a look at a few examples. 後 will be grouped with the case marking particle の before nouns, come directly before numbers, or be used at the beginning of whole phrases. Despite having many different translations, the base meaning of 後 will always just be to identify a sequence of things, and what comes 'after' or 'behind' a specific point in that sequence."

Typical sentence structures that use this pattern will start with an (A) phrase highlighting the 'expectation', be followed by 思 うように , then finished with a (B) phrase indicating the outcome. When (B) is a simple noun, 様 な will be used instead. As the (B) part of 思 うように sentences will contain the information about whether the 'expectation' of (A) either was or was not met, this phrase may be used either positively or negatively to show that something did not meet, met, or even exceeded that expectation."

As ぬき indicates the extraction of something, this grammar pattern is primarily used to indicate 'leaving out', or 'setting aside' something that is regularly included. 抜 きで acts as a suffix , so will be utilized after nouns, to indicate the thing that is being left out. Both the plain hiragana and kanji forms are fairly common. Additionally, の will replace で when ぬき is followed directly by another noun. Occasionally, にして may also replace で, but this is structure is more common when the part (B) section of the sentence includes a ない or できない based statement. These expressions indicate that something 'will not happen without (A)', or 'is not possible without (A)'. However; this is not always the case, as ぬきで or ぬきでは may also appear in negative sentences, with the same meaning."

In most cases, this grammar pattern will appear following words that indicate some kind of negative state or emotion. 極 まる will be used immediately following な-Adjectives, while 極 まりない will come after こと when either a な-Adejctive or い-Adjective precedes it. In the case of な-Adjectives, it is not a requirement that 極まりない be preceded by なこと, and it is actually more common for it to directly follow the な-Adjective without な. Caution 極 まりない is not the negative form of 極 まる , but the noun 極 まり 'the extremity' followed directly by the い-Adjective ない, with が omitted between them. This means that the more literal translation for the difference between the two would be something like the following. 失礼 極 まりない - There is no limit to the rudeness of (A). 失礼 極 まる - The rudeness of (A) goes to the limit. As can be seen, while the meanings are opposite in some sense, the actual nuance of (A) being 'extremely' something remains the same. The actual negative form of 極 まる would be 極 まらない , and would mean that something does 'not go to the limit of (A)'."

In many cases, this grammar point will be seen in hiragana, and will appear as either かい or がい, depending on how it is conjugating with the previous word. Possible translations include things like 'it is worth doing (A)', or '(A) will pay off'. が and the う-Verb ある 'to be' will follow かい. This states that the 'worth of (A) exists'. Occasionally, the が will be omitted. When following verbs, がい will be used after the ます-stem, or かい may be used after any standard form. The primary difference between these conjugation patterns is that there is more focus on the tense of the verb with かい, whereas がい will frequently have the nuance of it 'always being worth (A)'. When pairing with nouns, の will be required before かいがある. Alternatively, かいがない may be used in order to indicate that it is 'not' worth doing something. かいがある is primarily used when the speaker wants to convey that a positive result will come from something that is either difficult or unpleasant."

As a noun, it will usually be followed by の (when connecting nouns), or by the auxiliary verb だ , when at the end of a sentence. に will often be ommited when there is no need to put specific emphasis on a time. Occasionally, まず 'first of all' will be paired with 第一 . This may seem redundant, but is like saying 'the very first' in English. Fun Fact 第 is a kanji that is often translated as 'number'. However, the literal meaning is a bit closer to 'position', as it refers to the place that something has within a sequence of numbers. As such, 第一 simply means '1st position'."

Because of this, the most common translations of this verb are 'to be audible', or 'to sound like (A)'. 聞 こえる is an intransitive verb, and literally means 'to give off sound'. When using 聞 こえる , (A) will always be followed by が . (A) is considered to be the 'source' of the sound (a noun). However, the 'way that something sounds' will be marked adverbially. This means that an い-Adjective will be changed to its く form, and な-Adjectives /nouns will be followed by に . Fun Fact The primary difference between 聞 こえる , and 聞 ける (the potential form of 聞 く), is that 聞 こえる is used to identify things that do not require the active concentration of the listener to be heard. In other words, ambient noise. However, 聞 ける is used when the speaker is trying to concentrate on some specific sound, and refers to their 'ability' to hear it."

Using 誰 , or どこ is not limited to the か and も particles. へ , に , or と may also be partnered with か or も , to give a more specific meaning. As can be seen with these examples, か will always precede any other particle in a positive sentence. However, the opposite is true for も . も will always follow any other particles in negative sentences. This is because か will always attach directly to the noun (when altering the meaning of that noun), but も alters the whole phrase, not just the noun.

This is partly because it does not include に like other 限 る based structures, and therefore will have its meaning modified by the word that comes directly before it. 限 り will follow verbs in their standard forms, and nouns linked to である. Let's take a look at a few of the standard meanings and translations. The first meaning indicates that (B) is something that is limited to being within the scope of (A). This is the most standard meaning and can be translated as 'limited to (A), (B)'. The second meaning highlights that within the limit or scope of some particular source of information, (B) is true. This scope usually relates to the senses (like vision), or to knowledge. This may be interpreted as 'as far as (A), (B)', 'as long as (A), (B)'. The third and final meaning of 限 り will imply that 'limited to (A) being the case, (B) will occur'. In this nuance, 限 り simply implies that assuming that (A) is true, (B) is something that will need to be taken into account as well. This will be interpreted as 'while (A) is the case, (B)', or 'assuming (A), (B)'. Despite these various meanings, 限 る will always highlight (A) as the limit or constraint within which the logic of (B) exists."

When used in conjunction with the adverbial particles まで 'until', 飽 くまで can imply that (A) is 'just', 'only', or 'strictly' something. The more literal translation of 'to continue (A) to the point of getting tired of it' fits these interpretations quite well, implying that (A) will never deviate from what is being described about it. This use of 飽 くまで often appears at the beginning of a phrase, and functions adverbially. The adverbial particle も 'even' may be added for extra emphasis, but it is not required. In many cases, 飽 くまで will be used in polite sentences when the speaker is expressing their own opinion. In these cases, the nuance of 'this is merely my opinion' is conveying to the listener that the speaker realizes that what they are saying is not the only viewpoint. This way of highlighting opinions is often combined with structures like けど, or が when the speaker wants to soften their statement before offering what they think a solution might be."

This expression behaves similarly to だ and です by themselves (asserting that something is true). However, the addition of の strengthens the relationship being highlighted. Due to this, it will come across a bit like 'it is a fact that (A)' in English. In these sentences, we can think of the ん , or の as simply adding emphasis to the statement. Due to の adding emphasis, this expression will be heard very frequently in explanations. Caution There is no real difference between ん and の . Only の is considered 'correct Japanese', but ん evolved to make things easier to say. ん is the most common form in spoken Japanese, and the use of の could be considered a bit formal, or 'stiff'. While both the だ and です forms are equally as natural, only the です form will be used if adding か to the end ～んです か . This construction shows that the speaker is looking for an explanation about something."

For nouns and な-Adjectives , we will need to add で to the base form (not な or だ ). It should be noted that て and で are different structures here. て is the same conjunction particle that is used with verbs (meaning that い-Adjectives are similar to verbs), while で is actually a form of だ that is used for conjugation. It is the same で as the one that is used in the formal version of だ , である . Which we will learn later. Caution Like other て forms ( ている 1 , ている 2 , and ている 3 ), the て (or で ) form of other words can have several possible meanings. These meanings are as follows. Linking - Like 'and' in English. Reasons - Like 'with (A)', or 'because of (A)' in English. Manner - Like 'to do (B) in an (A) way' in English. Caution As with all other conjugations of いい , remember that it will be よくて, and not いくて."

                        "content": "In order to express that someone was 'made to do', or 'let do' something, the auxiliary verbs せる and させる will be used. The meaning that せる and させる will convey (when attached to a verb) is called 使役 (causative, employment, or using) in Japanese. A common misconception is that せる and させる are standard conjugations of each verb. However, these auxiliary verbs should be thought of as having their own meaning, in a similar way to how たい , ない, だ , です , and other auxiliaries each have their own meanings. In order to use these grammar structures, remove the る from る-Verbs , and then add させる . For う-Verbs , change the last kana to the あ sound kana from within the same column (except for う, which becomes わ), and then add せる (る becomes ら, む becomes ま, く becomes か, etc.). As usual, する and 来 る have special conjugation rules. する will be replaced completely by させる (in a similar way to how できる completely replaces する in the ' potential ' form). 来 る will become 来 させる . Caution With causative, either に , or を can mark the doer of the action that せる, or させる is linked to (not が). This is because the actual 'doer' of the action is considered to be the person that is making/letting someone perform that action. に will usually imply that someone was 'let' do something, while を implies 'make'. Fun Fact Because the actual 'doer' in causative verb sentences will be marked with が (as is always the case), the literal translation of せる and させる is closer to the following: (A) が (B) に 楽しま せる - For (A) to cause fun 'in' (B). (A) が (B) を 楽しま せる - For (A) to cause fun 'through' (B). It is these standard meanings of the particles に (a location) and を (a target) that will create the 'let', or 'make' nuance when using せる , or させる ."

However, the second common usage of は is to highlight contrast (making a comparison). When は is used after a number/counter, it regularly has this comparison meaning. This can be translated as 'or so', or 'at least'. Before は , the counter is regularly followed by くらい (or ぐらい ). This just softens the statement, and further highlights the 'or so' meaning. Despite being translated as 'at least', the comparative meaning of は itself is what creates the nuance of this grammar structure. The thing before は is being highlighted as an amount, while also implying that there are other amounts. This implication of another amount makes は sound as if it could mean 'as opposed to (B)'. So in essence, this grammar structure sounds like 'As for (A), as opposed to (B)', where (B) is not usually mentioned."

Sometimes these terms are simplified even further to 'other-move' (transitive), and 'self-move' (intransitive). Basically, this is the difference between verbs that require an object marked with を (transitive verbs), and those that only require が , to show that the subject itself is moving (intransitive). In Japanese, there are many transitive/intransitive pairs of verbs, and these will need to be memorized. Fun Fact In Japanese, the two ways in which all verbs can be described are an act/motion  ( 動作 ), and an act/motion upon something ( 作用 ). Fun Fact Although they are not traditionally grouped this way, する and なる may also be thought of as a transitive/intransitive pair. This is due to する always implying that something is being controlled (acted upon), while なる always implies that something happens on its own, or cannot be controlled."

Note also that れる and られる themselves behave like standard る-Verbs, so can be conjugated into a variety of different tenses in the same way as a standard verb. A common sight in modern Japanese is words where the ら may be removed, 'ラ 抜 き 言葉 ', and れる may be used by itself. However, this is not technically correct Japanese, and may cause confusion in cases where ら is required (with る-Verbs and くる , when られる is expressing 'passivity', 'respect', or 'spontaneous occurrence'). For う-Verbs , they will behave a little differently. Instead of the final kana of the verb changing to an あ sound, and then adding れる (as would be the case with passive verbs), the final kana of the verb will change to an え sound (る will become れ, う will become え, す will become せ, etc.) before adding る. Interestingly, する verbs do not have a ' potential ' form, and the verb できる will be used in its place. Caution ことができる and られる (when used in its ' potential ' meaning) have exactly the same nuance. However, many people consider ことができる to be slightly more polite. Fun Fact When using the potential form, either を or が may be used to mark the 'object'. You will need to be careful though, as this does not apply to できる , which may only ever use が ."

To use てみせる , simply alter the verb preceding it into its て-form. Due to みせる requiring a target for who the speaker is showing, this grammar pattern will only be used when there is either directly someone that will be shown (A), or when the speaker is talking about showing someone (A) that does not happen to be there at the moment either physically or temporally. It will not be used when simply strongly stating that you will do (A), unless who sees that (A) is important.

Because of this, れる and られる will almost always be paired with verbs that indicate some kind of communication. As these structures are in the passive, the literal translation is close to 'to do (B) in the state that (A) was done to me'. The (B) part will come directly after ままに and simply states how someone is going to react in compliance with (A). The conjunction particle が may appear between られる and ままに, but this is not common in modern Japanese. Although it does carry the meaning of 'but', the focus is more on expressing that the (A) is not being resisted or argued with when doing (B). Caution In this grammar pattern, られる will never appear in the past-tense form."

The case marking particle と in this expression highlights a 'result'. However, the addition of structures like the conjunction particles が, or たら , to the past tense of する will indicate that something interrupted (A), and therefore it was unable to be completed. In these cases, the translation becomes 'to have tried to do (A), but (B)', 'was about to (A), but (B), or 'was on the verge of (A), but (B)'. う and よう mark volition (the express intent to do something), while とする adds the nuance that the express intent has been decided, and all that remains is to 'do' the action. Due to this, when something interrupts a ようとする verb, it strongly suggests that (B) is/was highly unanticipated."
