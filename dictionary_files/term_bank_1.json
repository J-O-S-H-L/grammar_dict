                        "content": "飽 く is the old-fashioned and somewhat poetic version of 飽 きる the る-Verb meaning 'to tire of (A)', or 'to get sick of (A)'. When used in conjunction with the adverbial particles まで 'until', and も 'even', 飽 くまでも will imply that (A) is being done 'persistently', 'stubbornly', or 'to the bitter end'. The more literal translation of 'to continue (A) even to the point of getting tired of it' fits these interpretations quite well. 飽 くまでも will often come at the beginning of sentences before going on to describe that thing that is being done persistently. も is not required, and 飽 くまで may sometimes be seen without it. However, as the phrase is quite strong, it is far more common for も to be included to highlight the emphasis. Due to the persistence that the verb 飽 く itself can highlight, it will often be seen together in sentences that include words like つもり 'intention', to show that someone intends to do something regardless of the consequences. Despite 飽 くまで being a combination of 飽 く and まで, it will appear in most dictionaries as a standalone adverb in modern Japanese."

It will often be translated as '(B) owes everything to (A)', or '(B) existing is only due to (A)'. This structure is a combination of the う-Verb ある 'to be' in its て-form, and the case-marking particle の. あっての will be preceded and followed directly by nouns, where the first noun is (A), and the second noun is (B). あっての will primarily be used when (B) is something that benefits positively from (A), and therefore is showing or should show some kind of gratitude toward it. Occasionally, the case-marking particle が will come between the (A) noun and あっての . However, it is often omitted. Fun Fact あっての can be thought of as an evolution of the basic grammar structure がある 'to have'. The main difference being that の allows (B) to be marked as the thing that has (A), while the て-form indicates that there is more information that will be given later about why this is important. Due to this information that comes later being important, (B) will almost always be followed by structures like から, or ので."

Fun Fact Although あまり～ない is regularly translated as 'not very' the literal translation is closer to 'not excessively (A)'. This is due to 余 り (the kanji which this word comes from), meaning 'excessive', or 'to be in excess'. あまり has this meaning of 'excessive' in all of its grammar points, and the nuance will only change based on whether the sentence itself is positive (does not use ない), or negative (uses ない)."

However, unlike それ , あれ is used to highlight things that are away from both the speaker and the listener. Due to this, it is also often translated as 'that over there'. Caution Be careful not to mix up あれ with the common spoken expression あれ, which means 'huh?', or 'oh?'. These are not the same words. The difference will usually be clear from context within a sentence, and the way the word is said. あれ as 'huh?' has a rising tone, and sounds like a question."

For other verbs, add いたす to the ます stem of the verb, while attaching お, or ご to the beginning (depending on whether it is a word of Japanese or Chinese origin). Caution Words that include the kanji 拝 'to worship', or 'to revere', do not usually require お, ご, or いたす . This is due to the word itself being 'respectful'.

In this way, the literal meaning of 'what is said to be (A)' is carried over into the English translations.

As a predicate , い-Adjectives can appear by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used at the end of a sentence. When there are no other words apart from the adjective itself, it comes across similar to 'It's cute', or 'It's hot', and similar expressions in English. We just have to guess what the 'it' is from context. In many sentences, either は or が could be used to mark the word/words that the predicate is describing. However, which one sounds more natural will depend on many factors. In general, if you are specifically pointing out something as being different from other things in the same category, が will be used. In this example, が is distinguishing this specific bath as having a unique level of hotness compared to others (maybe the water system is broken and only boiling water comes out). は would sound unnatural in this type of sentence, as it is not the 'normal' state of the bath. Fun Fact All い-Adjectives are words of Japanese origin."

This change in kana is a bit different to other conjugations of う-Verbs , so let's take a look at them for the casual form. As can be seen in these examples, the changes consist of った, いた, いだ, んだ, した (the same as the changes for て form , but using た instead). For the conjugations using だ in place of た, this is simply a sound change in the language that happened over the course of history, to make words easier/smoother to say. It is not the auxiliary verb だ . For the polite past form of う-Verbs , the change in sound is far more consistent. This only requires a change from the う sound, to the い sound within the same column (from う to い, or from く to き, for example). When た is added to verbs (or any other word), it can have one of three possible meanings. Past: 過去 - Happened at some point in the past. (Did/Was) Completion: 完了 - An action that has finished 'happening'. (Done) Continuation: 存続 - A new state of something that is continuing. (Has been done) Caution With う-Verbs , there are a few verbs that are exceptions to the regular conjugation rules. Please check the structure guide for these."

It is usually translated simply as 'thanks to (A)', or 'because of (A)'. おかげで is a combination of the polite prefix お, the noun 陰 'shade', and the case marking particle で. おかげで can be used after any word in its attributive form . Literally, お 陰 で means 'in the shade of (A)'. This implies that (B) was only made possible due to (A) creating the ideal situation for it to occur. Caution おかげで may sometimes be used sarcastically, in the same way as 'thanks to (A)' in English. In these sentences, it is usually quite clear from the context/tone of voice that the actual meaning is negative. Fun Fact おかげで is often used at the beginning of a sentence in the same way as 'thankfully' or 'luckily' in English. This just means that whatever comes after おかげで happened, despite negative outcomes also being possible."

The primary difference between お and ご, is that お will be used with words/readings of Japanese origin (kun-yomi), and ご will be used with words/readings of Chinese origin (on-yomi). In fact, お and ご are both represented by the same kanji. For this kanji, 御 is one of the kun-yomi, and 御 is one of the on-yomi. Fun Fact Some verbs, like いでる, are used almost exclusively with honorific language . おいでになる (the お～になる form of いでる) is an example of this, and can mean 'to come', 'to go', or 'to be'. This is due to the perspective of the speaker when using honorific language , and something that we will discuss in more detail later."

Caution Although the original forms of か 知 らぬ, or かしらん were useable by anybody, かしら is thought to be very feminine in modern Japanese, and therefore is not often used by men."

The first is used in conjunction with 'why' and 'how' words, like どうして or なぜ, while the other is used with 'who', 'when', 'where', and 'what'. We will focus on the former in this lesson. かというと is a combination of the case marking particle か in its use as a question marker, the case marking particle と in its citation use, the う - Verb 言 う 'to say', and the case marking particle と in its result use. This is quite a few particles combined together, but the literal meaning is more simply 'if (A) were to be asked', before the speaker will go on to highlight their reasoning in (B). As ～かというと will come before some sort of explanation, から will also regularly be used at the end of the sentence as 'because', emphasizing the speaker's reasoning. Caution Like other grammar points that utilize the 'if' nuance of と , ば , and sometimes even たら may be used. However, たら will appear far less frequently than と or ば ."

Fun Fact かなり originally came from 可也 , and more recently 可成 . Both of these expressions mean something similar to 'to become undeniable', with the former structure using an older kanji for 'to become' 也 . かなり is still used this way today, highlighting that the amount/existence of something has reached a point that cannot be denied. かなり may be seen with this meaning when carrying either positive and negative connotations."

It will be translated as 'as if (A)', or 'just like (A)'. This is a combination of the adverbial particle か, の and the auxiliary verb 様 だ 'appearing to be'. The more literal meaning can be thought of as 'is it not like (A)?', due to the uncertainty expressed by か. かのようだ may follow verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns followed by である. When ようだ is altering the meaning of a verb or a noun later in the sentence, ように or ような may also be used. This grammar construction will often be seen with expressions that emphasize the speaker's assumption about (A), such as まるで. If compared to English, this merely strengthens the sentence in a similar way to the difference between 'it's as if (A)', and 'it's just as if (A)'."

It is often translated as 'because', or 'since'. In these cases, it just means 'Because of (A), (B)'. から may be used with almost any type of word, but when the nuance is 'because', it will require だ before it when following a noun or な-Adjective . Despite having several different nuances, it may be easier to think of から as meaning 'from' in all situations, as that is the base nuance. From (A as a reason), (B) = Because/Since. From (A as a location), (B) = From. Fun Fact から is a special type of particle in Japanese called a case marking particle . These are particles that describe the relationship that (A) and (B) exist in. We will learn more about these soon!"

Traditionally, we would use unique verbs for each of these situations, such as 'smells like (A)', 'tastes like (A)', 'feels like (A)', etc. While this is still possible in Japanese, it is not the most common way. がする is a grammar construction that focuses on the source of the smell, sound, taste, or feeling, and makes the sensory experience itself the subject of the sentence. To use がする , simply attach it to the end of any phrase that expresses which type of 'sense' is being created/given off by the subject. Fun Fact Japanese often uses 気 'energy', 'spirit', as something that can be perceived with the senses. Due to this, there are many phrases which use ～ 気 がする in the same way as this grammar point."

It is a combination of the case-marking particle が, the い-Adjective 早 い 'soon', and the adverbial particle か. It is often translated as 'no sooner than (A), (B)', or 'the instant that (A), (B)'. The more literal translation, taking into account the use of か, is '(A), or possibly sooner, (B)'. This just illustrates the instantaneousness of the (B) action in that (A) was unable to be determined as actually completed before (B) started. This grammar pattern is formal, and will follow verbs in their dictionary or past tense forms. The verb that comes in the (B) phrase will always be in the past tense. (A) will tend to be actions that happen momentarily, or having a clearly defined finish point. For actions that don't have a clearly defined finish point, 終 わる 'to finish' will often be linked to the stem form, in order to specify the end. Additionally, while the (B) action will often be unexpected, it will also usually be volitional, that is to say something done intentionally. Caution Due to が 早 いか always expressing something in the past, it cannot be used to express wishes or intentions for the future. Additionally, it will not highlight the speaker's own actions."

It is often translated simply as 'because of (A), (B)', 'with (A) as a trigger, (B)', or 'with the opportunity of (A), (B)'. きっかけ primarily appears in two different forms. (A) をきっかけに (B), or (A) がきっかけで (B). This grammar pattern may be seen either with verbs in their past-tense form or nouns. However, in the case of appearing after verbs, it will often be preceded by の or some other nominalizing structure like こと. In many cases, the trigger of (A) will have the effect of instigating a rather large change or new beginning. Caution - きっかけ will not be used when the causal relationship between (A) and (B) is plainly obvious, due to what would be expected or easy to anticipate result. Because of this, it can be thought that きっかけ is almost always referring to the opportunity of (B) appearing because of (A), with some external choice being made, or action being taken on that occasion."

                        "content": "来 る is one of only two main verbs in Japanese that do not follow the standard rules of conjugation for Godan and Ichidan verbs. The other primary verb being する . 来 る means 'to come', or 'to be coming'. 来 る will always have the particle に or へ attached to the location that someone 'will come', or 'has come'. The reason that 来 る is called a か-column irregular conjugation verb in Japanese is because the る in 来 る does not conjugate, but is dropped. This leaves the く being the part that conjugates. Because of this, 来る has qualities of both る-Verbs (the る being dropped), and う-Verbs (the remaining く changing depending on the conjugation). Here are some examples of how 来 る changes. （き）た, （く）る, （こ）ない. 来 る will often be seen as 来 ている when someone has come to a place and remains there. This is due to ている meaning 'to exist in the state of an action', rather than being exactly the same as '(A)~ing' in English. Because of this, 来 ている can mean either 'to be somewhere that one has come', or 'to be coming'. Sometimes the difference between these two will not be clear unless there is further context. Caution 来 ている (for existing at a place) is only used for places that people 'temporarily' go, so will not be used when you are at your home/work."

In sentences with ことか , words that highlight some particular number or extent are often used, before ことか comes at the end of the statement, expressing that 'extent' as being particularly unusual, or even unbelievable (thanks to the addition of か). This is often translated simply as 'how (A)', 'what (A)', or even 'god knows (A)'. Let's look at a few examples. Literally, ことか can be translated as 'to what particular (A) is (B)!?', as the enquiry is often not directed at anyone specifically, but instead presents itself as a question simply to emphasize its magnitude. Caution In modern Japanese, this expression is used primarily in written language, and has a tendency to sound either poetic, or dramatic. Because of this, it may sound unnatural in daily speech, unless the speaker is purposely being dramatic."

This structure may appear after any word in its attributive form , or after a noun that has been followed with の. Just like with its standard use in creating lists, し is being used in this grammar point to show that (A) is not exclusive. The way this comes across is that 'while there are other reasons, (A) is good enough to (B)'. (B) is usually some suggestion, invitation, or expression of determination."

As with んです , ことなの transforms 'it is (A)', into 'it is that it is (A)', simply emphasizing the point. ことなの may be seen in several different forms, and is quite often used in conjunction with というのは . In these types of sentences, というのは will present the topic, before ことなの will be used to show the conclusion that the speaker has drawn about that topic. This expression may be used with any word in its attributive form , nouns followed by の, or な-Adjectives followed by な. という may also be used directly before ことなの . However, this is not always the case, and is even more unlikely when it was already utilized in the first half of the sentence. Caution As というのは is quite long, it will often be shortened to って or とは in casual speech. Caution ことなの is also frequently used when asking questions. This is usually when the speaker has drawn a conclusion about something that has been said, and wants to confirm their understanding. なのか is very frequently heard/seen in drama, novels, manga, and similar types of media, but may be considered rude in daily speech."

                        "content": "In a very similar way to のは , こと is used in Japanese for nominalization (creating a noun-like phrase). However, unlike のは , which is a combination of two particles, こと is a noun . To use こと , just add it to the end of a verb in its dictionary form. こと (or 事 in its kanji form) is a noun that is often translated as 'thing', and in this way, literally means 'the thing that is (A)' when used for nominalization. As we can see from these examples, ない can also be used between the verb and こと , to form a 'not' statement. There are other auxiliary verbs that may be used with こと in this way, but ない is the most common. Although this lesson discusses こと pairing with the dictionary form of verbs, it can actually pair with any standard verb form. Standard form just means anything that does not finish with the polite ます. Fun Fact Unlike もの (another noun used to describe 'things'), こと is a noun that is frequently used to describe things that are 'intrinsic'. This basically means things that are describable, but not necessarily always observable (feelings, conditions, events, etc.). Caution When a sentence (usually short) finishes with こと , it quite often has the nuance of being a rule, or command. This こと is not actually a noun, but a sentence ending particle . こと as a particle will almost never be written in the kanji form. However, it does originate from the same word."

Together, they are used adverbially to express that something happens 'every (A)', or 'at intervals of (A)'. ごとに may be used after any verb (usually in non-past form), or noun. Although ごとに may be used after verbs, the most common use is with nouns, or phrases that finish with nouns. Caution ごと is the 訓読 み (Japanese reading) of the kanji 毎 , which means 'every'. This fact will be important when trying to remember the difference between ごとに and おきに , a similar grammar point which can also mean 'every', but focuses more on 'interval' or 'gap' of a specific time or distance. Due to おきに focusing on the space between 'each (A)', there are sentences where おきに and ごとに will have different meanings. Here, we can see that ごとに will mean 'every week', while おきに will mean 'every second week', due to there being a 'one week interval' when おきに is used. To make things easier, these two expressions can be remembered in the following way. (A) ごとに = During every (A), (B). (A) おきに = After every space of (A), (B). Fun Fact Many native speakers make mistakes with the difference between おきに and ごとに , so there are quite a large number of people (especially in the younger generation) that will consider them completely interchangeable."

These are as follows: 誘 い、 促 し - To invite, incite, or draw attention to something. 驚 き、 当惑 し - The express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment. 話 の 流 れ を 抑 える - To control or keep in check the flow of a conversation. In this lesson, we will be focusing on a specific feature of the first meaning (to draw attention). Unlike other types of drawing attention that さ is able to be used for (see this grammar point), this さ will only appear at the end of sentences. Here, さ is almost identical in meaning to that of よ, with a slight added nuance of high confidence in what one is saying. Caution This さ is primarily used by men, and can vary in meaning depending on the speaker's tone of voice. However, in almost all situations さ will mean 'what I just said is correct' (sometimes angrily, sometimes informatively, and even sometimes in a completely carefree way). Women may also use さ as a sentence ender, but わよ tends to be more common."

Caution As ざり is an old-fashioned structure, it conjugates a little bit differently with する than the regular ない. Notice here that instead of しない changing to しざる, せざる will be used instead."

This is a somewhat formal grammar pattern which indicates that both (A) and (B) exist at the same time, or are in unison. しかも itself focuses on the overall topic, so will be used for giving objective opinions, such as observable facts, rather than personal opinions. As しかも is a conjunction, it may be used between two phrases, or sometimes at the beginning of a second sentence, when referring back to the first. Often, (A) will be considered the 'base' information, while (B) is extra information added on top of (A), or further explaining (A). Fun-fact Originally, しかも came from the combination of the archaic interjection 然 'as such', or 'like that', and the particle も 'too', or 'also'. In this way, some reflection can be seen between it and modern English phrases like 'additionally', where the (B) information is simply adding on to what is already known about (A). Fun-fact In modern writing, しかも may also appear as either 而 も or 併 も , although both are quite rare."

This means that it has a similar meaning to ないだろう. Due to this, the combination of では, the う-Verb ある 'to be', まい 'not as if', and し, the particle that highlights reasons, all combine to have a literal meaning of 'it is not as if it's (A), so therefore (B)'. じゃあるまいし will be used after nouns, or phrases that have been nominalized with something like の. The statement that follows じゃあるまいし will state the speaker's opinion in relation to (A), and will almost always be negative."

All な-Adjectives behave similarly to verbs, in that their form changes depending on what comes after them. For 好 き , it will be followed by な when acting as an adjective, or one of either だ or the more polite です when acting as a noun. This distinction is made depending on whether it is linked to another noun, or is independent. In the example with だ, 好 き is expressing that the thing is 'likable' (assertion). However, in the example with な , 好 き is expressing 'likability' as a quality of the noun it is attached to. Caution 好 き is considered quite a strong adjective in Japanese when it is directed towards people, so it may be interpreted as romantic interest. 大 好 き is often translated as 'love'."

These may all seem quite different, but together they show the full meaning of 既 に very clearly. That meaning is 'to be completely unchanging'. Let's take a look at how すでに can be used with each of these nuances. Caution Due to 既 に implying something absolutely cannot be changed, it is often used to imply that something is 'too late', and that nothing else can be done about it."

This structure may be translated as 'completely (A)', 'all in (A)', or 'nothing but (A)'. Generally, it is attached directly to nouns, and expresses that (A) is to such an extent that nothing apart from (A) can be seen, felt, or noticed. In cases where ずくめ will directly modify the following noun, の will come between ずくめ and that noun. Although づくめ may occasionally be seen in older literature, it is mostly considered incorrect kana usage these days. While ずくめ may be used in either positive or negative contexts, it is mainly seen in set expressions, so is best used with combinations that you have already heard or read. Fun Fact 尽 くし is another older structure that is used to express things that are separate, but are grouped together. This is usually translated as 'all sorts of (A)', or 'all kinds of (A)'. It is the conjunctive form of the う-Verb 尽 くす 'to be exhaustive' with a voiced pronunciation of the つ."

It is a formal expression that is a combination of the negative classical auxiliary verb , ず, the case-marking particle に, the adverbial particle は, and the standard negated form of the う-Verb 済 む ‘to come to pass’, or ‘to finish’. Due to this, the more literal translation is ‘it will not come to pass that (A) is not done’, with the more natural English interpretations conveying the same feeling. As we can assume by this expression beginning with ず, it will exclusively follow verbs. Just like other instances where ず is used with する, ぜず will be the correct conjugation pattern. The standard (ない) negative form of a verb may also be followed by ではすまない. This has the same meaning as ずにはすまない. Caution This construction will tend to sound unnatural in cases where the speaker only considers (A) to be something that is necessary based on their personal feelings. (A) is usually something that would be the expected course of action according to anyone."

Being an adverb that often modifies the meaning of a whole sentence, it will commonly appear at the beginning of a statement. When 折角 is nominating an event as being long awaited, it will appear directly before the event, separated only by the case marking particle の. Fun Fact There are several guesses for where 折角 originates. One of the most common is that it is an abbreviation for 頭巾 の 角 を 折 る 'to fold the horn (tail) of a hood'. This was something that a famous confucian did intentionally to protect his hood from getting wet in the rain. The people of the time started to copy the act, and 折角 also came to be used as an idiom to mean 'intentionally', or 'to go out of one's way to do something'."

Caution Due to そういえば refering to something that has already been brought up over the course of a conversation, it will not be used to move on to completely unrelated topics in the same way that phrases like 'by the way' are used in English. Fun-fact そういえば is very similar in the way it is used to といえば, with そう simply replacing the direct quotation of と. Many textbooks will list both as a single grammar point, despite そういえば itself basically being a set phrase."

As with そうだ , そうに and そうな carry the meaning of 'seeming like (A)', or 'looking like (A)'. Caution そう may also be used when attached to the い-Adjective , ない. In this case, there is a unique conjugation rule which you will need to be careful of. As always, い will be removed from ない before attaching そう . However, さ will need to be inserted between な, and そう . This results in the construction なさそう. Note that this addition of さ does not happen with verbs. This is due to the ない that is used with negative verbs being an auxiliary verb ,  and not an い-Adjective . With the auxiliary verb ない, simply remove the い, before adding そう directly to the stem."

In most cases, それにしても simply highlights that while the speaker accepts or acknowledges the previous statement as true, that is not all there is to be considered. それにしても will primarily appear at the beginning of sentences, or directly after a comma.

As a word, そんなに is used adverbially. This means that it may come before any verb, い-Adjective , or な-Adjective . Almost any そんなに based sentence can be translated literally as 'to an extent like (A)', where (A) is the word that comes after そんなに , and に indicates 'to'. As そんなに is another example of こそあど 言葉 (words like これ , それ , あれ , and どれ ), it means that こんなに , あんなに , and どんなに may also be used. Despite this, そんなに is almost considered a set phrase, and is therefore the most common out of all of the possibilities (except for どんなに , which is often used when explaining/giving reasons for something)."

This nuance is usually used when the actual number of (A) is exceptionally low compared to the speaker's expectation of anticipation. たった will often appear at the beginning of sentences, and will either modify the whole sentence, or a specific number when followed by の and then that number. As たった is an adverb that is usually used for emphasis, it often accompanies other similar grammar patterns like だけ, しか, etc. Fun-fact - The common expression ただいま 'now', or 'I'm home' may occasionally be seen in the emphasized form たったいま . This is primarily when the meaning is 'now', or 'just now' (right at this present moment), rather than 'I'm home'."

This may be translated as 'while (A)', or 'remaining (A)'. Due to ～たなり sentences usually describing something happening while in the state of (A), it will often be followed directly by a comma, or by the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb だ, で. After this, the (B) phrase will then describe what is happening during (A). ～たなり will primarily be used to express an undesirable state continuing despite (A) having happened, although this is not a strict rule. As ～たなり indicates that (A) is something that is continuing to stay in the same state, it will often have the nuance of 'ever since (A)' in situations where a significant amount of time has passed. Caution This なり derives from the noun 形 'shape' in its hiragana form, and is different to the なり that is used as the classic copula."

As an extension of this nuance, ものだ can be paired with verbs in the past tense, creating a phrase similar to 'I used to (A) in the past'. However, the literal meaning is closer to '(A) was the way it used to be'. Due to ものだ being a strong determination of something's existence/truth, this expression quite often carries the nuance that the speaker is nostalgic about (A), reminiscing about (A), or being introspective about (A). This means that it will not sound natural when describing things that are seemingly inconsequential, or have no meaningful significance. When highlighting things in the past that are not particularly important, たことがある will be used instead."

This structure primarily follows nouns, before part (B) of the sentence will have a corresponding ない based word. Despite all of these possibilities, it should be noted that だけしか～ない is an expression that appears with negative verbs, far more than any of the other combinations. Fun Fact だけしか may appear as though it is saying 'only' twice, but each particle has its own specific nuance. These nuances are as follows: だけ - Removes one thing (from within a group), and presents it as the 'only' thing that fits a certain criteria. しか - Highlights something that exists by itself as not having any alternatives. Due to this, each meaning compounds together, with だけ saying 'just this', while しか adds 'and only this!'. Reversing the order and putting しか before だけ would not work, as the sequence of selection needs to be logical."

The basic meaning of this word is that 'while there are/were several possibilities, only (A) is true/was chosen'. だけ is used by attaching it to the base (dictionary) form of any word, except for な-Adjectives , which require な when being used adjectivally. Due to な-Adjectives being able to be used as either a noun or an adjective, the meaning of a sentence will be different depending on whether だけ is used with the noun form, or the adjective form. Basically this difference just highlights whether something is being discussed in a measurable way (an adjective), or an immeasurable way (a noun)."

It will be paired with negative structures and presents 'minimum' or 'light' examples to which (A) does not apply, and therefore obviously also does not apply to anything greater than (A). It will be translated as 'not even (A), so not (B)', or 'not (B) at all'. だに will be seen following nouns or noun-phrases. Although だに often appears when the (B) part of a sentence is negative, だに itself is not limited to being used this way. When following verbs, and the (B) phrase is not negative, だに simply means 'just'. It is best to keep this in mind, as the core meaning of this adverbial particle will always be to mark the word or phrase before it as an extremely small amount or lower limit. Caution だに is only used in a very limited set of expressions in modern Japanese. Some example of these are 夢 にだに 'even in a dream', 想像 するだに 'even in my imagination', 考 えるだに 'even to consider', 聞 くだに 'even hearing', 微動 だに 'even a quiver'."

In this way, it is very similar to the 'again' in 'what is (A) again?' け may only be used after the past form of the auxiliary verbs だ or た. This means that け (should) only be seen as だっけ or たっけ. It is also common to see のだ and んだ utilized to make verb tenses a possibility. Caution Despite the grammar rules related to っけ , the younger generation quite often uses it without the addition of んだ (especially with verbs). While it is important to understand that this is still っけ , it is not a grammatically correct form that may be used in writing (or formal speaking). Fun Fact け will sound equally natural when asking a rhetorical question to yourself, or when directly asking another person about something that you have forgotten."

In these cases, the noun is generally a person (perhaps the speaker themselves), and the translation will be 'oh that (A)', 'that darn (A)'. (A) will primarily be people that the speaker is quite familiar with, and they are expressing some kind of real or playful frustration."

                        "content": "っぽい (occasionally also seen as ぽい) is a suffix that may be attached to many different types of words, in order to create new い-Adjectives . In all cases, っぽい indicates something that is 'exhibiting characteristics of (A)'. This is most often in reference to the way (A) is acting, or the way (A) looks. In English, っぽい may be translated as '(A)ish', '(A)like', or 'tendency to (A)'. っぽい quite often carries a negative connotation. As っぽい creates い-Adjectives from other words, it may be used with the conjunctive form of verbs, or the 語幹 (stem form) of any other word. Caution As っぽい creates new い-Adjectives , っぽい itself may be conjugated in exactly the same way as regular い-Adjectives . Caution The fundamental meaning of っぽい will change depending on what type of word it is being used with. The general rules are as follows: Verb + っぽい - To have a tendency to do (A). Adjective + っぽい - To exhibit all the signs of being (A). Noun + っぽい - To obviously not be (A), although show signs of being (A). From this, we can see that っぽい is generally based on the opinion of the speaker, rather than the innate qualities of what is being observed. Thus, with verbs, adjectives, and nouns, the speaker feels like (A) is in excess, compared to what would be expected. This 'being in excess of what is normal' in the opinion of the speaker is what creates the negative connotation."

Caution Like つつ , つつも will usually include a non-physical action in (A), such as reading, listening, looking, thinking, etc. (B) may be either physical or non-physical.

                        "content": "つもり だ (or です ) is a grammar point that can have several meanings in Japanese, but is often translated simply as 'intend to (A)', or 'plan to (A)'. It can be used after the plain (dictionary) form of verbs, or after the ない form. In the last two sentences, there is quite a large difference in nuance, and can be thought of as similar to the difference between 'to intend not to' ない つもり , and 'to have no intention of' つもり は ない in English. The former will mean that (A) is being actively avoided, while the latter will indicate that one simply has no plans to (A). Fun Fact The literal meaning of つもり comes from the verb 積 もる, which means 'to pile up', or 'to load'. Due to this, つもり is regularly used to describe people that are doing something that is out of character for them, meaning that they have 'piled up' whatever feeling was required to act that way. In this example, the nuance of つもり is 'so you're really going to act like you're apologizing?!' However, the literal meaning is closer to 'so you've really piled up enough (nerve) in order to act like that's an apology?!' Caution The は in つもり は ない is interchangeable with が or じゃ (usually では is not used). The difference in nuance is that が gives the impression of being 'uninterested' in (A), while じゃ simply expresses that (A) is not the intended result."

However, that is where the similarities stop. てある may only be used with transitive verbs, and highlights the object itself as being the subject of the sentence (rather than the initial person/thing that performed the action). Because ある is being used, it highlights the object as being inanimate (or unable to undo the action that was performed on it). Due to this, てある is regularly translated as 'to be left (A)', or 'to remain (A)', where (A) is the original verb that somebody performed on the object. が may mark the object in these sentences when the action itself involves some kind of preparation. Examples are as follows: 予約 - Reservation (requires time investment to reserve). 準備 - Preparation (requires time investment to prepare). 録音 - Recording (requires time investment to make the recording). In situations that involve no real preparation (opening a door, for example), を will be preferred when marking the object."

Here we will take a closer look at several of the verbs that will be used with ている , to express 'existing in a state of (A) having been done'. All of these verbs would appear as the past form in English, after the initial thing has 'started', 'come', 'died', or 'gotten angry'. However, this is not the case in Japanese. In Japanese, once something is angry, it exists in the state of being angry, once something has started, it exists in the state of being ongoing, once something dies, it exists in the state of being dead, and so on. Fun Fact One of the easiest ways that you can tell whether a verb will use the ている form, or the past form, is to think about whether it can happen twice. Something cannot 'start' twice, so it will use ている . Something cannot die twice, so it will use ている , etc. This does not work with every verb, but will help with over 90% of the verbs that require this form. Something has fallen and is already on the ground, so it cannot fall again. ている will be used."

It is often translated as 'ever since (A)', and will always express a new state of (B) that has been ongoing since (A). Although the literal translation is 'with that which was from (A)', the fact that (B) is ongoing is simply implied. As with てから, this structure will be seen following verbs in their て-form. Although not quite as common, からというもの may be seen following それ, when それ is at the beginning of a new sentence. In these cases, それ will linked to what was stated in the previous sentence. Caution As this phrase implicitly highlights something that has remained ongoing ever since (A), it will not be used when (A) is something that only happened in the very recent past. However, because length of time is subjective, it usually depends on what is considered 'long' based on any specific outcome."

Alternatively, 仕方 がない may be used, but there is an extremely small difference between these two structures, with the noun 仕方 also meaning 'way' or 'method'.

This expression describes the word that is attached to it as being 'extremely (A)', or that one 'can't help but do (A)'. In most cases, てならない will be used when (A) is something that occurs naturally, such as feelings. Due to this, a more literal translation is close to 'to not be able to move on from (A)'. In this way, it just indicates that (A) is so intense that the person affected by it cannot do anything about it. Caution In addition to being spontaneous and uncontrollable, (A) will almost always be something that is ongoing, rather than just being momentary."

Despite this ならない by itself is often considered a standalone word which may indicate that something is 'not possible', 'not permitted', or 'cannot be helped', depending on what type of word it is following. When following verbs and ては, ならない can only mean 'cannot', or 'must not'. Caution As a reminder, in the order from most casual to most formal, てはだめ, てはいけない , and てはならない will often be seen in sentences with no significant difference in meaning. Due to the ならない variant being the most formal, it is also the most likely to be seen in writing or polite speech."

While this is translated as 'to try to (A)', the actual meaning is closer to 'to do (A), and see (whether the result is good or not)'. This grammar construction is usually only used when someone tries something for the first time. As mentioned above, this phrase is also used when suggesting that someone else should try something. In these situations, (A) + てみて , or more formally, (A) + てみてください will be used. Sometimes, in very casual situations, even the て will be dropped, and (A) + てみ will be used by itself. This usually has the nuance of 'come on, just give it a go!' Caution When てみた appears in the past tense, it will imply that the attempt was successful, unless specifically stated otherwise by the speaker. Fun Fact While the kanji for 見 る may be used in this grammar point, it will result in the 'see' meaning being heavily stressed (rather than 'try'). This may cause a misunderstanding on the part of the person listening/reading."

This is a combination of ても (or でも when following nouns or な-Adjectives), and the る-Verb 差 し 支 える 'to interfere', or 'to hinder' in its negative form, 差 し 支 えない. It may be used either for asking for or granting permission. Due to this pattern being polite, ありません will almost always be used in place of ない by itself. The more literal translation is 'it is not a hindrance if (A)'. In cases where permission is being asked for, か will be added to the end of ありません. Caution Although ても 差 し 支 える is used in polite sentences, the verb 差 し 支 える itself is not strictly reserved for use in polite language, and will appear in sentences when implying that (A) has or will have a negative impact on (B)."

This will be translated as ‘to do for’. In other cases, やる acts more like 見 せる ‘to show’, and indicates the speaker’s strong will to perform an action. In these cases, it will be translated as ‘I will do (A), just wait and see’, or ‘I’ll definitely do (A)’. However, in either the place of あげる or みせる, the underlying meaning is just ‘to do’, with emphasis on the doer being the person that is in power over the result of the action due to their superiority."

Fun Fact Because the な that is used with な-Adjectives is simply the attributive form of だ , である may replace な or の when connecting one noun to another. The attributive form just means the form of a word that can be directly linked to a noun. As ある's attributive form is just ある, it does not need to be modifed at all. However, although this is grammatically correct, it would sound quite stiff in many circumstances, and should be avoided in standard speech. Caution であります (as opposed to である ) is very formal, and will almost exclusively be used by people within jobs that absolutely require this level of formality (politics, police force, military, etc). Due to this, its use within regular conversation will sound stiff, or perhaps even like the speaker is jokingly being over polite."

Both です and でございます are considered polite speech . However, でございます is the more polite of the two. Let's take a look at a few examples. でござる may also be seen, as it is the base form of で + ございます a (special-class) verb. However, in modern Japanese, this is primarily restricted to historical dramas, or characters that have a somewhat 'quirky' personality. Fun Fact Using でございます to introduce yourself is considered quite polite, however, when referring to other people, いらっしゃる 'to be' is preferred, as honorific language is more respectful than polite speech ."

These constructions highlight the 'ingredients', or 'materials' that something is/was made out of. Let's look at some examples. から and で are both case marking particles in this grammar point, and while they express much the same thing when translated into English, there is a slight nuance difference. These differences are as follows: から - Literally 'prepared from'. Tends to be used more frequently when the material is not obvious at first glance. May also put focus on the ingredients/materials before there was any alteration. で - Literally 'prepared with'. Tends to be used more frequently when the materials are more obvious. Despite this, recent generations use で in most situations, regardless of if the material is visible at first glance or not. As a result, でできる and からできる are almost indistinguishable in modern Japanese. Caution There is also a small nuance difference between できる , and できている , when used as part of this construction. できる is usually used when talking about something broadly 'everything in category (B) is made from (A)', while できている is used more frequently when examining a specific item 'this particular (B) is made from (A)'. Like the difference between で and から though, they are largely interchangeable."

As で is being used in its standard meaning of 'with' or 'by', でよければ implies that the speaker is enquiring whether the quality/ability of (A) is good enough to achieve some specific result."

The more literal translation is something similar 'that which is said to be (A), (B)'. In this way, it simply presents (A) as a thing that requires further explaining. Additionally, ということは will appear at the beginning of sentences, when the speaker is confirming their understanding about something that has just been said. Often in the form of a question.

As can be seen from the breakdown of という, こと, and は, this statement just expresses that the 'thing' which is 'classified as' (A) is 'in general' understood to be (B)."

                        "content": "というのは is a phrase that combines the case marking particle と,  the う - Verb 言 う,  and the nominalizing particle combination のは. Together, they are usually translated as 'the ~ known as ~ is ~', or 'the ~ called ~ is ~'. Sometimes, it can even simply be '~ means ~'. In essence, というのは is just a way to turn an entire phrase into a noun, before explaining that noun further. This explanation of (A) will either be to give a definition of it, or to give a reason for it. To use というのは , attach it to the end of a phrase that you would like to indicate as being something that will be explained further '(A)', and then follow it with your definition/reason, '(B)'. Caution Unlike というのは, which is mainly used to strongly present facts, or highlight points of discussion, replacement of は with the adverbial particle も can be used either as a rebuttal or as an extension of the original statement. This is when someone wants to show that (B) has equal weight when compared to (A). It may also be used to give the reason or cause for (A). Caution というのは is sometimes used at the beginning of a new sentence, when the speaker wants to add extra information about what has already been said. In these situations, the translation is similar to 'what I mean to say is ~', or 'because of that, ~'. Caution というのは is regularly abbreviated as とは, or って. This can be a little bit hard to identify in casual speech, but the '(B) explains (A)' concept will still almost always apply, so should be identified that way."

Although not required, だ will often be seen before nouns and な-Adjectives, and というわけではない. と 言 うわけではない will regularly be used when the speaker is denying that something said earlier is the reason for something. This could either be a misunderstanding that they themselves want to avoid, or something that the listener asked them to clarify. Fun Fact When used in the positive form, という 訳 だ is often attached to the end of statements that are considered to be either obvious, or clear due to context or common sense.

It is a set expression that primarily uses only hiragana. という connects two nouns, and means 'the (B) that is called (A)', or 'the (B) known as (A)'. Fun Fact という (and the verb 言 う itself) is often quite misunderstood, as the closest translation in English is 'to say'. In Japanese, 言 う actually refers to the information about something that cannot be discovered by simply 'looking at' it. For example, if you look at a man, you cannot know that his name is Bob, or that he works in an office, but you can know whether he is 'short', 'tall', etc. Due to this, という should only be used to express information that requires intimate knowledge, and not simple observations. It is possible to see (A) という (B) in sentences where (A) is describing something that seems 'obvious'. However, in these cases, the speaker is usually implying that something about (A) is not exactly as it seems, or that their opinion/knowledge differs. This particular nuance is not limited to nouns, and may be seen with almost any word type."

It may be translated as ‘how to put it’, or ‘perhaps it’s (A), or perhaps it’s (B)’. However, the more literal ‘shall I say it is (A), or shall I say it is (B)’ is also a common interpretation. This expression will be used twice, where both the (A) and the (B) phrase are being questioned by the speaker. As with many other uses of と of a quotation , the preceding word may be almost anything. と 言 おうか is interchangeable with the more common と 言 うか, but it is advisable to only use it when specific emphasis needs to be made, or for some type of dramatic effect. In many cases, it will sound unnatural in daily speech. と 言 おうか will frequently be used with fairly vague or imprecise descriptions, in order to avoid but hint at what the speaker actually wants to say. Often, this will be something negative, and will therefore be omitted."

This structure is a combination of the case-marking particle と, and 来 る combined with the conjunction particle たら 'if', 来 たら. It will often simply be translated as 'that blasted (A)', or 'that damn (A)'. Despite this, the literal meaning is just 'when it comes to (A)'. ときたら will directly follow nouns. This grammar pattern will almost exclusively appear in kana, so memorizing the stem verb it comes from will help to remember the meaning. Fun Fact In line with the literal meaning of 'when it comes to (A)', ときたら may also be used when the speaker wants to highlight something about (A) that is 'to be expected', or 'only natural'. Determining whether ときたら is being used in this way, or to express frustration, is usually quite clear in the second half of the statement. Despite having two almost opposite nuances, it may help to think of ときたら as just 'when it comes to (A)' in all situations, with the (B) part of the phrase indicating whether it is positive or negative."

The first is 'in spite of (A)', or 'regardless of (A)'. This nuance of ところ will be that the speaker is politely acknowledging the situation that someone else is in, and apologizing for interrupting them in that moment. ところを may come after any structure that could pair with a noun. This means verbs in their standard forms , い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives followed by な, or nouns followed by の. The second meaning that ところを is often used for will simply be 'when (A)', or 'at the time of (A)', with a focus on being a situation in which the action of (A) is interrupted by (B). This may have either a positive or negative nuance. This use of ところを will appear exclusively after verbs in any of their standard forms . The を itself may be omitted when used to express either of these meanings. Fun Fact ところを is occasionally split into two different grammar points depending on the source. However, it is important to remember that the underlying meaning of both of these is the same. ところ marks the place or situation, while を marks how that situation is being utilized either positively or negatively. When it comes to apologizing, the speaker themselves is the one 'using' that moment with を, and is therefore acknowledging that."

This may be translated as 'even if we assume that it's (A)', or 'assuming that (A)'. However, the literal translation is quite close to 'even going off that it were (A), (B)', as としても simply expresses that despite (A) not being true, the speaker is willing to say that it is for arguments sake, before giving their thoughts about that hypothetical situation. としても will be seen following verbs and い-Adjectives, or nouns and な-Adjectives that are followed by だ. In some cases, としても just functions as an extension of として 'as', and can be interpreted as 'even as (A)'. This nuance primarily highlights people or organizations in the position of (A), and states that 'even for (A), it will still be (B)'. Unlike the previous nuance, this としても will only be used with nouns."

It will be interpreted as ‘(A) of all people’, or ‘such as (A)’. Often, ともあろう will be followed by the speaker's opinion about how (A) is being ignorant of what is expected of them. This construction is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the adverbial particle も, and the volitional form of the う-Verb ある, あろう ‘to be’. The literal meaning is ‘even a (B) such as (A), (C)’, with (C) being something unexpected or unwanted. ともあろう will be seen after nouns, and may be followed by the conjunction particle が ‘but’, or a combination of the noun もの and が for further emphasis. もの is primarily used for emphasis, and other words such as 方 ‘individual’, or 人 ‘person’ may also be used. Caution Occasionally, this grammar pattern may be used sarcastically towards someone of the same position or lower. The context of the sentence is the only thing  that would clarify whether it is criticism or sarcasm."

In either case, the nouns that are marked with と are usually all performing some mutual action (that mutual action may simply be existing). When と is used as 'with', it means that both/all people or objects are equally involved in the action. However, に highlights that one person is the target (destination) of an action, so will result in something sounding a lot more one sided. Here we can see that both people are talking when と is used. It is a mutual conversation. When に is used, however, the person marked by に is being talked 'to', and is usually not actively participating in the conversation."

(B) is most frequently いけない 'cannot go', which makes ないといけない a double negative phrase, which translates to 'must do (A)', or 'have to do (A)'. いけない may be replaced with だめ, to make the phrase more casual, but ならない is generally not used with ないと . ないといけない is regularly abbreviated to ないと , but has exactly the same meaning in these cases. Caution As と has the 'and' nuance, it gives ないと a level of strength that is not seen in similar phrases like なければいけない , or なくてはいけない . Because of this, ないと is often used to highlight things which absolutely 'must' be done (obeying the law, adhering to customs, using common sense, etc.)."

Quite often, this expression is used to highlight something that the speaker expects should happen, but for some reason does/is not. To use なかなか (or 中々 in its kanji form), なかなか will be put at the beginning of a phrase (or directly before the negative verb), before further describing the situation. Fun Fact As 中々 just means the 'middle' of something, this expression can be thought of as highlighting that something is not in the 'middle' (optimal place to achieve a certain result). Due to this, it often expresses that the speaker wants something to be in that 'optimal position' but feels frustration due to the fact that it isn't."

These meanings are as follows: 同時 の 動 き - Two things that are existing/happening simultaneously. 確定 の 逆説 - Two things that are unexpectedly existing/happening simultaneously. We will focus purely on the 同時 の 動 き meaning in this grammar point. To use ながら , simply add it to the ます stem of verb (A), and then highlight verb (B) as part of the following clause. This may be translated simply as 'while' in English. Grammatically, the (B) action is considered to be the 'important' action, while the (A) action expresses the timeline within which (B) takes place. Caution Due to the (B) action being considered the 'primary' action of something that (A) is related to, (A) and (B) must have the same subject. Fun Fact When used to express 確定 の 逆説 , ながら will be followed by も . ながらも is a separate grammar point that we will learn more about later. In this construction, も is expressing surprise about the fact that (A) and (B) coexist."

However, this is where the similarities end. なくてはならない is an example of a double negative in Japanese, and actually has the meaning '(A) must be done', or 'must do (A)'. While this grammar point is usually translated as 'must do', the literal translation is 'must not, not do (A)'. This double 'not' is where many learners have difficulties. ならない simply means 'cannot become', and comes from the negative form of なる . To use this structure, simply create the negative form of a verb, and then convert ない to なく (the conjunctive form of an い-Adjective ), followed by て . After this, は is added, and then finally ならない . ならない is considered to be the most formal structure out of ならない , いけない , and だめ. It is regularly used in formal writing, or semi-formal/formal speech. いけない (the most common variation) and だめ (the most casual variation) are also acceptable in many situations. Caution The ては in なくては is often shortened to ちゃ, as this is easier to say. なくちゃ may then be followed by ならない . However, due to ならない being quite formal, なくちゃ (a casual structure) will not be used with ならない on a regular basis. It is more common to see なくちゃ paired with いけない , or だめ. These casual structures are very similar to words like 'gotta' in English."

The literal meaning of this structure is close to 'it's not that it isn't (A)', and is a type of double negative. Although preceded mostly by verbs, this structure sometimes appears following nouns. When that is the case, が, は, or sometimes even に may be between なくはない and the noun. Additionally, the は in なくはない is interchangeable with も, with only a slight strengthening of the nuance when も is used. This structure often appears with the potential form of verbs, in order to show that something is not impossible, despite appearances or what one may think."

Like お～になる , なさる has exactly the same meaning as する . なさる can be utilized in any situation where する would be used, as a direct replacement. It is a special-class verb, which means that it has some unique conjugation rules. In its casual form, it will conjugate in exactly the same way as a う-Verb . However, in the polite form, instead of る changing to り (as would be expected of a う-Verb ), it will change to い instead. Caution Although some Japanese speakers will use it, expressions like なさって いらっしゃる are considered double keigo ( なさる is honorific language , and いらっしゃる is also honorific language ), and are technically incorrect. However, なさる may be partnered with ます, which is simply polite speech . Fun Fact なさる is considered a little bit old fashioned in modern Japanese, and お～になる is the preferred form used by most native speakers."

Due to the way that しも alters まだ, a more literal translation of this grammar point can be thought of as 'if it's (A), then of course there's still that, but as for (B)'. Fun Fact しも is a classical particle that is not frequently used in modern times outside of set phrases or expressions like ならまだしも , 今 しも 'right this moment', and だれしも 'absolutely anybody'. In all cases, it merely strengthens the word directly before it."

One of those uses is to convey the meaning of 'as soon as (A), (B)', or 'the moment of (A), (B)'. This structure will follow the dictionary form of verbs and is classified as a conjunction particle . (B) is usually something that is surprising, and brought about by a strong sense of will or emotion. Additionally, なり is almost always used in relation to other people, rather than oneself. Fun Fact Despite appearing to be a conjugation of the う-Verb なる 'to become' at first glance, なり is actually one of the readings of 形 , meaning 'shape', and refers to the overall situation of (A) in a similar way to ところ."

However, depending on the type of word used, conjugation rules will differ slightly. For な-Adjectives , they will always need to be followed by な , when used before a noun. This means that adjective (A) is describing qualities/features of noun (B). Caution Many words can take either な or の when describing a noun. The difference in meaning is usually clear. Let's take a look at both nuances. (A) な (B) means that - (A) is a quality/feature of (B) (A) の (B) means that - (A) is the type/purpose of (B) To avoid making this mistake when using な-Adjectives to describe a noun, it can be helpful to think about whether you are describing a 'quality', or the 'purpose' of something."

Like に 際 して 'on the occasion of (A)', it will often be used in regard to preparation for future events. This structure is a combination of に, and the う-Verb 当 たる 'to hit', or 'to come into contact' in either its formal-conjunctive form or て-form. に 当 たり will appear following verbs in their dictionary form, or nouns. There are two primary nuances that this structure will be used for, so let's look at a few examples of each. The first is when (A) is some sort of special occasion or condition from which (B) will be done. The second is when (A) is some sort of goal or target for which (B) will be the means or measures in response to that goal. Caution Unlike に 際 して , which can be used for either positive or negative situations, に 当 たり will primarily only be used for positive or neutral situations."

As the literal meaning of this structure is 'without being influenced by (A), (B)', or 'without being affected by (A), (B)', the primary nuance is on the fact that (B) is something that exists or will happen without consideration for (A). Due to this, に 関 わらず may also be used to show that 'any type of (A) will result in the same (B)'."

These structures primarily express a lack of power over the ultimate result, or a lack of significant difference between (A) and any other potential choice. Translations include 'even in the case of (A), (B)', or 'even for (A), (B)'. These structures combine either of the case-marking particles と or に with the past tense of する, した, the noun ところ, used for marking the situation, and the case marking particle で. It will directly follow nouns or noun-modified phrases. These patterns can be thought of more simply as a combination of にする 'going with (A)' or とする 'as (A)', and the たところで 'even if (A), not (B)' grammar structure that indicates negative outcomes. In casual situations, たところで will occasionally be replaced with たって."

This structure is a combination of に, and either of the imperative forms of する; せよ, or しろ. せよ tends to be more common in written material, while しろ is more common in speech. Despite the English translations, this particular use of the imperative form of する translates more accurately to 'so it's (A), who cares!', as the speaker is just strongly stating that the actual condition of (A) is unimportant in the overall sentence. When repeated, にせよ～にせよ illustrates that regardless of either '(A) or (B), (C) is still true'. In many cases, (A) and (B) will only be a small sample of possibilities, with the actual meaning being 'in (A), (B), or any similar situation at all, (C) is still true'. にせよ and にしろ may appear following verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns in any of their standard forms. Caution Although not grammatically incorrect, it is quite unnatural to mix the use of にしろ with にせよ . Due to this, when using this pattern, it will be important to repeat the same exact expression. Fun-fact にせよ～にせよ is regularly used with pairs of antonyms. In a broad sense, this just illustrates that 'for the opposites of (A), (B), and everything between, (C)'."

Despite the English translations, this particular use of the imperative form of する translates more accurately to 'so it's (A), who cares!', as the speaker is just strongly stating that the actual condition of (A) is unimportant in relation to what they actually want to say. にせよ and にしろ can appear following verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives or nouns in any of their standard forms. As this structure is fairly direct, in most cases it will be used as a way to emphasize that regardless of what the case is for (A), (B) is still true, or is the more important matter to consider."

Literally, the translation is similar to 'being taken along with (A), (B)', or 'in tow with (A), (B)'. につれて will be used after the plain, non-past form of verbs, or nouns. As 連 れる is a transitive verb, (A) につれて (B) implies that (A) is causing (B) to happen simultaneously.

The literal translation is 'it does not extend to (A)'. This nuance of the phrase will appear after nouns. In this comparative use, the structure may also be translated as 'to be no match for (A)', 'to fall short of (A)', 'to not be on par with (A)'. には 及 ばない will be used most frequently when (A) is something that is being given extremely high praise. As such, set combinations like (A) の 足元 には 及 ばない 'to not even reach the feet of (A)' will often be seen."

The literal translation is ‘pulling back and switching away from (A), (B)’. This ‘switching away from’ portion may be used as a reminder of the large size of the difference that this grammar pattern usually indicates. に 引 き 換 え is a combination of the case-marking particle に, the conjunctive form of the う-Verb 引 く ‘to pull’, 引 き, and the conjunctive form of the る-Verb 換 える ‘to switch between’, or ‘to interchange’, 換 え. に 引 き 換 え may follow almost any type of word, but will require a の to precede it before い-Adjectives or verbs, and なの to precede it before な-Adjectives. (A) and (B) will always be two opposite ends of some kind of spectrum, where one is considered to be good, while the other is regarded as bad based on the subjective opinion of the speaker. Additionally, それにひきかえ may be used to begin sentences where the comparison is being made to a previous statement. Caution Both (A) and (B) will be facts that are plainly observable or measurable. Due to this, に 引 き 換 え will not be used in sentences that make assumptions or guesses."

This structure is most frequently seen connected to verbs, い-Adjectives and nouns in their standard forms. In most cases, this pattern will appear without kanji. Literally, this phrase can be thought of as expressing 'without being affected by (A), (B)', or 'without fixating on (A), (B)'. However, it is almost always used in exactly the same way as のに 'despite'. Caution It is important not to get にも 拘 わらず mixed up with に 関 わらず. The former expresses 'despite', while the latter tends to be used more often for 'no matter if'."

However, it is used in almost exactly the same way as から 見 て 'from the perspective of (A)'. To use にとって, simply attach it to the end of a noun (or noun phrase) that you would like to express a certain viewpoint, judgment, or opinion from. Fun Fact にとって comes from the verb 取 る 'to take'. In this way, it literally means 'to take up (A)', where (A) is the location (standpoint) being highlighted with the case marking particle に. Broadly, にとって has two main uses, these are as follows: の 身 として - From (A)'s standpoint. (When used about people) の 立場 から 見 て - When looking at it from (A). (When used about things)"

Although this feeling of 'opposition' may be negative, in most circumstances, it just means 'toward' in the sense of targeting something. に 対 する will be followed directly by a second noun, while に 対 して creates a pause in the sentence, before (B) will be explained in the second half of that sentence. Fun Fact Compared to に 関 して (another structure used to show how things 'relate' to each other), に 対 して focuses on (A) and (B) equally, explaining how those things interact, compare, or contrast each other. Caution As に 対 して strongly contrasts (A) and (B), this grammar structure will often be used to express differences between two things. This is very similar to 'whereas' in English."

Literally, it means 'there is nothing beyond (A)', or 'nothing surpasses (A)'. This structure will be seen with verbs, adjectives, and nouns in their standard forms. に 越 したことはない sentences generally present something positive, or some ideal outcome that is wished for. Caution - It is also quite common to see に 越 したことはない following words that use ない. In these cases, rather than '(A) would be the best', the meaning simply changes to 'it would be best if not (A)'."

Care will need to be taken with translating these sentences, as they will express that 'there is nothing better than -not- doing (A)'. Fun Fact The literal meaning of 限 る is 境 を 付 ける 'to set a boundary'. This means that に marks the location (or situation), within which the speaker then states as being 'the boundary'. Because of this, 'to be bound to', or 'to be limited to', are also possible translations of に 限 る."

These translations are usually 'in', 'at', 'to', 'for', or 'on'. Let's look at an example of each meaning. While these examples may seem quite confusing at first, it will be easier to think of に as always having one 'basic' meaning. That meaning is to be the 'end-point' of an action. This means that whatever action is being described, can only be considered complete/able to be completed once you're at/while you're at the location/time described in the sentence. Verbs like 住 む (to live/dwell) often confuse learners, as they use に instead of で . This is also due to the fact that 住 む is a verb that can only be 'completed' at the destination. (You can only complete the act of living/dwelling in the place that you live, so to speak)."

Both will appear in their plain form. In this expression, のが is performing the same function as in the regular のは・のが construction. This function is nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun). However, のは cannot be used with this phrase, as が is always required with adjectives.

Common translations include 'I think it's (A), isn't it?', and 'it might be that (A)'. However, being that this is just a combination of の, ではない 'isn't', だろう 'probably', and か, the literal meaning is simply 'is it probably not that it's (A)'. Just like in English, the elongation of the phrase and not saying anything with certainty makes it sound more modest. のではないだろうか may be seen following verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns when preceded with な. Additionally, でしょう may replace だろう. This phrase can also be used when seeking agreement from the listener, or when mildly trying to persuade them that your way of thinking may be correct."

This phrase is made up of the following parts: のは - Used for nominalization (creating a noun phrase). は highlights contrast between two (or more) elements. の 方 - A combination of の, the case marking particle , and 方 , a noun meaning 'side', or 'direction'. だ (or です ) - The auxiliary verb used for 'determining' something. The literal meaning of this grammar point is something similar to 'that which is (A), is on the side of (B)'. By saying that something is on the 'side' of (B), it comes across more gently than expressly stating that it 'is (B)'. To use this construction, attach のは to the end of a phrase, and then follow it with a noun + の 方 だ. Note that のは will become なのは if the final word before のは is a noun. Fun Fact This phrase is often used apologetically, to express that someone feels that they are the individual who is (more) responsible (for causing a certain outcome)."

Like the auxiliary verb そうだ , ようだ may be used in a similar way to な-Adjectives (can be followed by な when acting as an adjective, or に when acting as an adverb). の is required before these constructions when it is describing a noun. Because よう (coming from the kanji 様 ) usually expresses the 'manner' in which something is existing/happening, it is regularly used when the speaker has direct personal experience from which they are drawing a comparison. This means that よう will sound far more confident than みたい , or そう . Fun Fact When ようだ is describing another word (in its ような , or ように form), this is known as 'presenting an example' ( 例示 in Japanese), and means that '(A) is an example of (B)'."

However, this use of 疎 か is not seen much in modern Japanese, and the word will mainly be used in set expressions where it doesn't behave exactly as a な-Adjective usually would. Despite this, the meaning of 'alienation', or 'completely removed from' is kept in はおろか , as it simply means 'completely putting aside (A), (B)'. Common translations include 'let alone (A), (B)', and 'it's needless to say that (A), when (B)'. (B) and (A) will usually be things that fall into the same category, where (B) is considered the far more obvious of the two. Due to this obviousness, (B) will often be immediately followed by the adverbial particle さえ. This shows that (B) is the noteworthy minimum extent. Alternatively, さえ may be exchanged with other adverbial particles that fill a similar purpose such a も, すら, or まで. In most cases, は 疎 か sentences tend to have a fairly negative nuance."

This means that it expresses something that the speaker is 'quite sure is true', but cannot confirm. The most common translations of はず are 'bound to be (A)', and 'should be (A)'. As はず is a noun, it may be used in any place that a noun would usually be used. It will often be followed by だ , or です . Caution Despite はず sometimes being translated as 'should', this is only when you think that something 'should be true', and cannot be used when making suggestions/giving advice. Due to this, 'bound' is the more accurate translation of 筈 , in almost all situations. Fun Fact The だ (or です ) in はずだ may be omitted. This usually makes はず sound a little less certain, like 'bound to be (A)... probably'. In the same way, speakers may sometimes add はず to the end of their sentences in a similar way to 多分 , in order to show that they are not 100% certain about whether what they just said is accurate or not."

This construction is made up of the adverbial particle は, the case marking particle で, and 有名 , a noun that may also be used as an な-Adjective . ～は～で有名 is usually translated as '(A) is famous for (B)', but literally means 'with (B), (A) is famous/renowned'. The structure may be broken down in the following way: (A) は - Presents (A) as the topic. (B) で - With (B), in で's use as 'with'. 有名 だ - Is famous. As can be seen from these examples, こと (or の) may precede で 有名 . This is quite common when an entire phrase is being described as the famous aspect of (A), rather than a single word. Caution If 有名 is being used as a な-Adjective , it will appear before the famous thing/place itself. This form will usually be utilized when the speaker wants to give further detail about exactly what (A) is."

It is frequently used to highlight a hypothetical situation, or a viewpoint/characteristic of another person. When 場合 は is highlighting a viewpoint/characteristic of another person, this is almost always in contrast/comparison to something that is already being discussed. This is an example of the contrastive nuance of the は particle. Caution In relation to a situation, because 場合 means 'to encounter (A)', it has a nuance of randomness. Due to this, 場合 は will not be used to describe events that regularly occur, or events that can be planned/controlled."

                        "content": "When paired with the case marking particle に , ばかり regularly conveys the meaning of 'simply because', or 'just because'. Literally, this expression means that 'even with just (A), (B) is/was able to occur'. This phrase is regularly paired with the past form of verbs, indicating that something that has already taken place, led to some other result. To use ばかりに , simply attach the expression to the end of any word in its attributive form . It should be noted that this particular grammar pattern has a strong tendency to be used with results that are negative. However, this is not a requirement. A high level of eagerness/enthusiasm can also be expressed when paired with grammar points like たい, or ほしい. Fun Fact As we mention in our ばかり grammar point, one of the more common kanji that ばかり stems from is '許', which means to be 'let off' or 'let through'. It implies a minimum amount of something that is then deemed as 'permissible'. This nuance is kept in ばかりに, as the (A) part of the sentence is being highlighted as that minimum extent of something for which the (often surprising) result of (B) is/was possible. Due to this, translations such as 'even with only/just (A), (B)' are quite similar to ばかりに, so long as it is clear that (A) is surprising. Fun Fact The kanji that is used most frequently for ばかり is the same kanji that is used for 許 す 'to forgive'. In this particular use of 許, it still means 'to let off', or 'to let through', as 'to forgive' quite often has the nuance of letting something through/pass/slide."

Literally, it just highlights that 'if it is (A), then the limit of (A) will be controlled only by its extent'. To use ば～ほど, ば will be paired with the hypothetical form of any verb/ い-Adjective (or noun/ な-Adjective with なら on the end), before the same word will be repeated in its attributive form . After this, a (B) part of the sentence will highlight what the expected result of (A) is. As である (the formal version of だ ) may replace な with な-Adjectives (or なら with nouns), sometimes である will be used instead of な/なら, in regard to both nouns and な-Adjectives . Caution When this expression is used with する verbs, the noun that する is linked to in the ば part of the sentence does not need to be repeated in the ほど part. Fun Fact Sometimes, the ば 'hypothetical' part of the sentence will be omitted altogether, leaving ほど to perform a similar function by itself."

This use of ふう appears following verbs, and works in the same way as a な-Adjective. This means that it will be followed by に when being used adverbially to further describe something that is being done 'in the way of (A)'. Also, it is common for ふうに to be used after pre-noun adjectival words such as こんな, そんな, and あんな. This just highlights that something is being done 'like this', 'like that', etc. Fun-fact For ease of remembering, coming from the kanji for 風 'wind', ふう can be thought of as similar to English phrases like 'to have an air of (A)', etc. However, this is just a tool for memorization, as the overlap in meaning is not 100%."

In many cases, the particles に and へ are interchangeable, but there is a slight difference in meaning. へ focuses more on the distance/effort required to get between (A) and (B), while に focuses more on the connection between (A) and (B). へ always comes after the noun signifying the destination. In these examples, while they may seem the same at first glance, へ shows that there is a space between (A) and (B), while に puts the emphasis solely on the destination. This is why common expressions such as 'city/country name へ ようこそ' sound very polite. It is like saying 'Welcome, and we acknowledge your journey/effort to get here'. In the TV-show example, this commonly means 'thank you for your effort to watch this particular show, out of all the ones you could have chosen'."

                        "content": "べくして is a combination of the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb べし, べく, and the conjunctive particle して, which shows a situation from which a logical determination can be made, or will be a natural course of action. べく itself indicates the word that it is attached to as a 'purpose' or 'end goal'. べくして is often translated simply as 'as expected of (A), (B)', or 'as was supposed to (A), (B)'. (A) and (B) will be the same verb repeated. The literal meaning of 'as determined with the purpose of (A)' may also be used if it helps to remember the nuance. This expression is quite formal, so will rarely be heard in daily speech. Fun Fact As mentioned in other grammar patterns that contain variations of べく such as べき and べし, this structure derives from the kanji 可 , which is usually translated as 'permissible' or 'allowed'. All 可 really indicates is a situation that does not currently exist, but it certain to come about as a part of the most logical course of events."

The most accurate translation for the word ほとんど itself is simply 'almost', where the thing that it is describing is always considered to be a full group, rather than a single thing. As with many other adverbs that highlight an 'amount' in Japanese, ほとんど can modify a whole phrase, or can be used before の , to further specify a single noun. In negative sentences, ほとんど translates as 'hardly any'. This is mainly due to the 'full group' that ほとんど is describing being highlighted as almost 'not' existing."

Adding the particle か to this expression simply changes the nuance from 'let's', to 'shall we?', and is more of a direct question than ましょう by itself. Like ましょう , this expression can be added to the ます stem form of any verb. One thing to note with these examples is that they are 'suggestions', not 'invitations'. In Japanese there is a slight difference between the two, in the same way that there is in English. If you want to invite someone to do something, the most natural way would be to use ませんか , a phrase that is similar to ましょうか . The difference here is that 'won't you do (A)?' has a stronger nuance of being a direct invitation, while ましょうか is closer to just 'let's do (A)!'"

In this kind of sentence, it would be far more natural to use a statement like 一番 , 最初 or 一位 if discussing rank. Caution When using まず , it can sound like you are giving someone advice, so be careful to use polite language, or perhaps と 思 う to show that the suggestion is just an opinion."

The reason that Japanese only requires one word for both of these nuances is due to まだ literally meaning 'something is unexpectedly still going'. From these sentences, we can see that まだ may be translated in each case as the following. (Non-past) - Although (A) is expected to not be there/happening, it is. 'Still' in English. (ている) - Although (A) is expected to not still be going, it is. 'Not yet' in English. The negative form of this will be discussed more in まだ～ていません . This is the opposite of もう , which means 'something is unexpectedly finished'. まだ may also be used to ask questions. This is when the speaker thinks that something 'might' be continuing, but wants or needs to confirm. Fun Fact まだ is often used simply as an expression indicating that something is 'lacking', or 'not yet' where it needs to be. In these cases まだ is frequently repeated as まだまだ, for emphasis."

In many cases, this use of ままに indicates that the speaker or doer is letting the action of (A) happen in whatever way is most natural, and is not making any particular effort to control the outcome. Due to this, there are only a limited number of verbs that are commonly used with ままに , and it is best not to attempt to use combinations that you have not come across before. Some standard sequences are 気 の 向 くままに 'in whatever way my attention is inclined', 思 うままに 'in whatever way I think up', 思 いつくままに 'in whatever way I come up with', 足 の 向 くままに 'in whatever direction my feet are pointed', 赴 くままに 'in whatever way it proceeds', 欲 するままに 'in whatever way is desired', and 風 の 吹 くままに 'in whatever way the wind blows'."

One of these ways is through the use of the な-Adjective , みたい . みたい can be used after any word that a な-Adjective would usually follow, to express that something is 'like (A)', or 'similar to (A)'. In the above examples, we can see that みたい should always be followed by だ (or です ) when it is at the end of a statement, however, this is frequently omitted. みたい is also often used to describe another noun, but needs to be followed by な in these cases. In this type of sentence, it is just expressing that something is '(B), but resembles (A)'. みたい is used most often in conversational situations, and is based on direct, reliable information. It is far less formal than its counterpart, ようだ . Caution Despite みたい meaning 'to resemble', and being based on (usually) visual stimulus, it should not be confused with 見 たい 'to want to see'. This is a common mistake that learners make, as みたい itself does not have a kanji form. Fun Fact みたいだ is originally an abbreviation of the more formal phrase を見た ような . As a result of this, we can see that ようだ kept its formal meaning, while みたい became the casual equivalent."

These expressions are a combination of the adverb 若 し, the case marking particle か, and one of several combinations of する (したら, して, or すると). It is often translated as 'perhaps', 'maybe', or 'possibly'. As with many other Japanese adverbs, it will often appear at the beginning of sentences. Due to もしかしたら presenting hypothetical situations, かもしれない will regularly appear in the same sentence (although it is not required). As もしかしたら is a combination of もし 'if', か (presents a question), and したら 'so happens that', the literal translation is close to 'does it so happen that', or 'should it so happen that', with past or present tense being controlled more so by the following statement."

It is a combination of the noun もの 'thing', and the adverbial particle use of か for conveying 'doubt' or 'uncertainty'. Common translations include 'definitely not (A)', 'absolutely not (A)', and 'do you really think that (A)'. Literally, the meaning is quite close to 'as if' in English, as ものか just poses a strong question to which the speaker already completely disagrees with. ものか may appear after any word that could attach to もの, such as a verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns followed by な. Other forms which may be seen are もんか , もんですか , and ものですか , with women being more traditionally likely to use the もんですか and ものですか variants. Additionally, when following the た form of verbs, ものか will imply that the speaker cannot bear for (A) to eventuate, due to evaluating it as something highly negative. Caution There are several other situations in where ものか will be used, but in each of them it may be easiest to think of the primary translation as being 'as if (A)', as it merely implies the speakers shock or disbelief in relation to whatever conditions are presented in the previous statement. These 'conditions' may involve an amount, possibility, or result of (A)."

However, it is primarily used when the speaker is trying to convey their displeasure at the result of (B), due to (A) being something that by all means should have happened. ものを will be translated as 'if only (A)', or '(A), but (B)'. Despite being a construction of もの and the adverbial particle を, ものを is often considered as a standalone conjunction particle . It can be seen following verbs or い-Adjectives in their standard form , or な-Adjectives followed by な. As can be seen in the above examples, ものを is almost always preceded by hypothetical structures such as ば at some point leading up to its use. Caution ものを will often be seen at the end of sentences, with what would have come after it being left unspoken. In these cases, the important information is still there, as the (A) part of the sentence will always highlight what the ideal result was. Because of this, it can be safely assumed that the speaker is just frustrated that (A) didn't happen. Fun Fact The adverbial particle を is often used this way in Japanese, where no specific action is linked to it. In these situations it usually just indicates an ideal or goal to which the method of achieving it (the verb that would usually be attached to を) is omitted. ものを can be thought of as an extension of this in literally meaning 'to that which was (A)', with 'I wish it had happened' being unsaid."

Due to this, it is very similar to other structures like など, and will often translate as '(A) and so on', or '(A) and the like'. やら may appear following verbs in their dictionary form, nouns, い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives. When repeated as (A) やら (B) やら , both (A) and (B) will often be the same type of word, although this is not a limitation when the speaker is expressing various feelings in relation to something. Compared to とか , やら puts more emphasis on the scope of things within the category of (A) and (B), thus making it sound like (A) and (B) are only a small fraction of many different things within a complex pool of various emotions, actions, etc. Caution When appearing as のやら～のやら , this emphasizes that the speaker does not actually know which one out of (A) and (B) is the correct option, and is just presenting both as potential possibilities. Due to this, (A) and (B) will often be antonyms or opposites of some sort in these types of sentences, but not always."

It may also frequently appear in its kanji form, 様 だ. ようだ can be used with any verb, い-Adjective , な-Adjective , or noun. However, it requires な before it when used with な-Adjectives , or の when used with nouns. Although ようだ and そうだ are often used in similar situations, そうだ shows that the speaker has a lot less confidence in their statement than ようだ . Because of this, ようだ is a much better choice when stating things that are obvious/observable by anyone. Caution ようだ is considerably more formal than みたい , and is therefore less common in casual conversation."

This use is known as 推定 (presumption) in Japanese. However, despite being a presumption/assumption, らしい usually sounds relatively confident. らしい is regularly translated as 'it seems like (A)', or 'I heard that (A)'. To use らしい , attach it to end of any (non-polite) verb, adjective, or noun. In these examples, らしい indicates that the speaker has some reason to believe that (A) is true. This could be that they heard, saw, or read something, but are still not 100% sure whether their understanding is correct or not. In this way, it sounds very similar to 'it appears as though (A)' in English. Caution There are 2 main forms of らしい in Japanese. The auxiliary verb usage mentioned above, and the 形容詞 の 一部 (auxiliary adjective), a type of adjective that must be attached to another word for it to have any meaning usage. らしい has the meaning of something that is 'typical of (A)', when used as an auxiliary adjective. This い-Adjective use of らしい will be covered more in our second らしい lesson."

This is regularly translated as 'there is no way that (A)', or 'it is impossible that (A)'. However, as mentioned in other わけ lessons, わけ is used very similarly to 'so' in English, so may also be thought of as 'it is SO not (A)', with 'so' being used for emphasis. In this structure, わけ is combined with the case marking particle が, and the い-Adjective ない. わけがない may be used with verbs, or adjectives in their attributive form . Caution Compared to わけではない, わけがない is much stronger, and emphasizes the 'non-existence' of something. This can be thought of as similar to the difference between 'it is so that it isn't (A)' (for わけではない), and 'it is SO not (A)' (for わけがない ). 'It is so that it isn't (A)' highlights that (A) is a thing that exists, but not in the way of (A). On the other hand, 'it is SO not (A)' highlights that no part of (A) whatsoever can be considered to be correct/accurate."

It may be translated as 'expressly', 'especially', or 'to go out of one's way to (A)'. わざわざ will usually be used at the beginning of sentences, before some statement will be made about an activity that was intentionally done. わざわざ has a tendency to be used positively, although it may be used with negative connotations as well. Fun Fact Although almost never used, 態態 may be seen in this kanji form. 態 is a kanji used to express 'purpose', or 'intent'. Generally, it refers to someone's 'willingness' to do something. As such, わざわざ just expresses that (A) is something that the speaker has as a strong goal. How it will be translated depends more on whether the actual result is positive, negative, or undecided. Positive result - To purposefully do (A), with the result of (A). Negative result - To have every intention of (A), with the actual result of (B). Undecided result - To be intent on (A), with (A) hopefully happening. Caution わざと is a construction that comes from the same kanji as わざわざ. わざと generally only conveys 'on purpose', while わざわざ has many more potential meanings (due to being stronger)."

As this grammar pattern is mainly used to highlight an origin of creation, it will often be seen in sentences that use verbs like 書 く 'to write', できる 'to be able', and 作 る 'to make'.

It is used in a similar way to the case-marking particle で, and will be translated as 'with (A)', 'by (A)', 'via (A)', or 'by means of (A)'. As this structure is preceded by the particle を, it will only be used directly following nouns, or noun phrases. Despite being similar to で in meaning, をもって will generally not be used in regard to simple methods of doing something, such as 'traveling by train'. Due to this, the translation of 'by means of' is the most accurate, as it would only be used in situations where the speaker is trying to emphasize the means, like in English. In addition to this, it is not often used with concrete items, such as a fork or a hammer, but instead will appear alongside abstract concepts, like 'with sincerity', or 'with compassion'. Fun Fact をもってすれば is a commonly occuring pattern, and may be translated as 'going off the assumption that it were with (A)'."

As this structure begins with を, it will need to follow a noun.

It will usually just be translated as 'don't do (A)', or 'you mustn't (A)'. んじゃない is almost always used from a higher position toward someone of a lower status. It may be used when the speaker is angry, but not always. んじゃない is a combination of the case-marking particle の, and the abbreviated form of ではない, じゃない. It will connect to the dictionary form of verbs. Despite being slang, the slightly more formal version んじゃありません can also be seen occasionally. This variation is common when the speaker wants to forbid something, but not sound angry, such as when an adult is talking to a child. The more literal translation of Verb + んじゃない is just 'it's not (verb)'. This sounds a bit strange in English, but might be similar to something like 'you're not (verb)', where a person is directly telling another what they shouldn't do. It is also common to see the abbreviated ている form, てん, before じゃない. Caution When used in the past tense, んじゃなかった indicates that something 'should not have been done', and has a nuance of regret or disappointment that the action occurred. Caution When んじゃない comes at the end of a sentence, it will be important to listen to the intonation, as the statement may actually be a question. In this case, it is an abbreviation of んじゃないか. The difference between these two uses of んじゃない will usually be very clear. A question has a rising intonation, while an order will have a dropping intonation."

The literal meaning of いったい is 'one body', or 'one form'. In this way, when paired with questions, いったい can be thought of meaning 'in a way that can be understood, what is (A)', or 'in a way that makes sense, what is (A)'. Fun Fact Like the 'one body', or 'one form' meaning mentioned above, 一体 is sometimes used to mean 'in general', or 'generally' when seen as 一体 に. However, this use is slowly becoming less common, partly due to how often 一体 is used simply to express surprise or shock."

This grammar point is used in a similar way to its literal meaning, which is 'with the above/previous (A), (B)'. 上 as 'above', and で as 'with', in で's use as a case marking particle . 上 で is a structure that is primarily used in formal settings. Due to this, it will not be used in casual conversations very often. It also strongly hints at (A) being a requirement for (B), or (A) being something that would logically be expected before (B). Caution Due to 上 で being used to show logical progressions from (A) to (B), (A) cannot be a verb that is passive. Passivity in Japanese often implies that someone/thing has a lack of control in relation to the actions that happen to them/it. As a result of this, (A) not being able to be controlled would result in (B) sounding like it could not be planned for. This is different to the way that passivity works in English (simply showing that something received an action upon it)."

However, the literal translation of ‘in line with (A)’ also works just as well in many cases. Caution Although 並 み may occasionally have the meaning of ‘as standard for (A)’ as a suffix, the ‘average’ or ‘ordinary’ meaning is often reserved for when 並 み is used by itself as a noun. In these cases it will usually be written as 並 , and be followed by the case-marking particle の, and then a second noun marking what the average is. Caution 並 み may only be used in sentences where (A) has a standard or norm that is well recognized, or easily identifiable. In cases where the ‘norm’ would change based on an individual’s opinion, rather than what the actual standard is, it will sound unnatural."

Often, this will come across as ‘before even (A)’ in English, and is used to criticize something that is thoughtless or irresponsible. 以前 will appear directly after another nouns, the dictionary form of verbs, い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives. In most cases, 以前 will be followed by either the case-marking particle に or の, depending on whether it is being linked to a subsequent verb or noun. The word 以前 itself is usually reserved for highlighting larger distances in the past than 前 ‘before’ by itself, and can therefore simply be thought of as an emphatic version of 前 . This emphasis is often what gives rise to the tone of criticism. As it is stating that ‘way before (A), (B)’, or ‘long before you even think of (A), (B)’."

Like many uses of 何 , the pronunciation change to 何 is simply for ease of speech. Despite being used mainly in positive situations, 何 といっても may occasionally appear with a negative nuance as well, although this is far less common."

Literally, it is closer to 'completely not (A)', or 'entirely not (A)', coming from the kanji 全 's meaning of 'whole'. Like many other adverbs, まったく may be used at the beginning of a sentence, or directly before the word that it is describing as being 'not at all' (A). It is common to see this expression using both the kanji form, and plain hiragana form of 全 く, so both should be learned early. Caution まったく is very similar to 全然 , another grammar point that is used to highlight the complete lack of something. However, まったく tends to sound a little bit more serious, and is therefore more likely to be used in formal writing/situations. 全然 on the other hand is far more common in casual speech."

Let's have a look at a few examples. This 'especially' nuance of 別 に comes from 'separately' being negated. The literal meaning of 別 に～ない is something like '(A) cannot be separated/differentiated'. This comes across as 'maybe it is a little (A), maybe a lot (A), but in any case, it cannot be said that it IS (A)'. Caution 別 に will quite often be paired with わけではない , as they both express uncertainty. However, it should never be paired with わけがない , as this would be combining a statement that removes certainty, with one that adds certainty."

If a sentence consists of '(A) 却 って , (B)', what it means is 'putting aside (A), (B)'. 却 って is an adverb . 却 って itself translates most closely to 'instead'. However, this is not the 'instead' used for phrases like '(B) was chosen over (A)', but the 'instead' used for phrases like '(A) couldn't be achieved, so (B)'. This shows that (A) is usually the intention or aim of the speaker, but (B) was the result instead. Fun Fact Another reading of the kanji used in 却 って is 却 く, which means 'to retreat'. This further highlights 却 って 's nuance of 'stepping away' from the (A) statement, to show the real result of (B)."

Due to this, it is regularly used to describe ideal situations in which individuals should be doing something together, without thinking about their own personal gain. Caution 合 う may also be used to in regard to sports/contests. In these cases, it may seem like players are not doing the action 'for' each other, but involvement from both sides is required to make the act possible."

                        "content": "In Japanese, there are numerous ways to express an order, command, or instruction. The most direct, abrasive, and therefore least used method is called the imperative form , which happens to be one of the basic conjugations of verbs. Without particles following it, the imperative form is fairly uncommon in daily life, but will often be seen on traffic signs, posters, or banners. In addition, it can be also heard shouted at demonstrations, when cheering at sports events, or in urgent situations, such as an officer yelling at a suspect to stop. Verbs are conjugated into the imperative form in the following way. For う-Verbs, simply replace the last kana of any verb with the equivalent え sound kana from the same row. For る-Verbs, replace る with either ろ or よ. The imperative form may sometimes be softened with the particle よ . This is a pattern which is mostly used by men that are familiar with each other, in order to offer advice or encouragement. Women tend to use the more polite て-form of verbs instead. Any verb except for ある and いる may be conjugated to the imperative form, due to their meanings being based on existence and nothing more. Fun Fact The なさい , polite imperative that comes from なさる is mostly used by teachers and parents talking to their children. It is also often used in instructions on  test papers. When speaking to animals, the polite prefix お plus the ます-stem will also occasionally be used. Fun Fact Originally, よ was used instead of ろ with る-Verbs. Despite this, with time it has been gradually losing popularity, and nowadays it is considered to be a more formal, written variant."

It will be translated as ‘to wind up as (A)’, ‘to end up as (A)’, or ‘to come about that (A)’. This expression will be used primarily after verbs in their dictionary form . Due to 始末 being used to highlight negative outcomes that are the result of going through a specific event, it will often appear in sentences that also include words like とうとう ‘to come to a head’, 挙 げ 句 ‘after a long process’, or 結局 ‘in the end’. It may seem redundant to include these phrases, but as 始末 has the more literal translation of ‘to culminate in’ (including everything from beginning to end), it is more emphatic, rather than redundant."

Let's have a look at a few examples. 後 will be grouped with the case marking particle の before nouns, come directly before numbers, or be used at the beginning of whole phrases. Despite having many different translations, the base meaning of 後 will always just be to identify a sequence of things, and what comes 'after' or 'behind' a specific point in that sequence."

This phrase may be interpreted as 'as one hopes', 'as desired', or 'as one thought'. 思 うように is simply a combination of the う-Verb 思 う and the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb ようだ, ように. Typical sentence structures that use this pattern will start with an (A) phrase highlighting the 'expectation', be followed by 思 うように , then finished with a (B) phrase indicating the outcome. When (B) is a simple noun, 様 な will be used instead. As the (B) part of 思 うように sentences will contain the information about whether the 'expectation' of (A) either was or was not met, this phrase may be used either positively or negatively to show that something did not meet, met, or even exceeded that expectation."

Both the plain hiragana and kanji forms are fairly common. Additionally, の will replace で when ぬき is followed directly by another noun. Occasionally, にして may also replace で, but this is structure is more common when the part (B) section of the sentence includes a ない or できない based statement. These expressions indicate that something 'will not happen without (A)', or 'is not possible without (A)'. However; this is not always the case, as ぬきで or ぬきでは may also appear in negative sentences, with the same meaning."

In most cases, this grammar pattern will appear following words that indicate some kind of negative state or emotion. 極 まる will be used immediately following な-Adjectives, while 極 まりない will come after こと when either a な-Adejctive or い-Adjective precedes it. In the case of な-Adjectives, it is not a requirement that 極まりない be preceded by なこと, and it is actually more common for it to directly follow the な-Adjective without な. Caution 極 まりない is not the negative form of 極 まる , but the noun 極 まり 'the extremity' followed directly by the い-Adjective ない, with が omitted between them. This means that the more literal translation for the difference between the two would be something like the following. 失礼 極 まりない - There is no limit to the rudeness of (A). 失礼 極 まる - The rudeness of (A) goes to the limit. As can be seen, while the meanings are opposite in some sense, the actual nuance of (A) being 'extremely' something remains the same. The actual negative form of 極 まる would be 極 まらない , and would mean that something does 'not go to the limit of (A)'."

This use of 気 is often interpreted as 'to feel like doing (A)' in English. More literally, 気 may be translated as 'mind', as is similar to the way phrases like 'to have half a mind to (A)' in English, indicating that something is either positively or negatively drawing the speaker's attention toward doing (or avoiding) the action of (A). As 気 itself is a noun expressing the 'mind' or 'intention' to do (A), it may be followed by a variety of different verbs indicating an array of slightly unique nuances. Common patterns are 気 がある 'to have the feeling of (A)', 気 がない 'to not have the feeling of (A)', 気 がする 'to feel like (A)', 気 がしない 'to not feel like (A)', 気 が 出 る 'for the feeling of (A) to come about', and 気 が 出 ない 'for the feeling of (A) to not come about'."

In many cases, this grammar point will be seen in hiragana, and will appear as either かい or がい, depending on how it is conjugating with the previous word. Possible translations include things like 'it is worth doing (A)', or '(A) will pay off'. が and the う-Verb ある 'to be' will follow かい. This states that the 'worth of (A) exists'. Occasionally, the が will be omitted. When following verbs, がい will be used after the ます-stem, or かい may be used after any standard form. The primary difference between these conjugation patterns is that there is more focus on the tense of the verb with かい, whereas がい will frequently have the nuance of it 'always being worth (A)'. When pairing with nouns, の will be required before かいがある. Alternatively, かいがない may be used in order to indicate that it is 'not' worth doing something. かいがある is primarily used when the speaker wants to convey that a positive result will come from something that is either difficult or unpleasant."

When using 見 える , (A) will always be followed by が . However, the 'way that something looks' will be marked adverbially. This means that an い-Adjective will be changed to its く form, and な-Adjectives /nouns will be followed by に . This usage of 見 える will be covered more in our focused lesson on this particular grammar structure. Fun Fact The primary difference between 見 える , and 見 られる (the potential form of 見 る), is that 見 える is used to identify things that do not require the active concentration of the spectator to be seen. In other words, seeing it is unavoidable (if looking in its direction of course). However, 見 られる is used when the onlooker, is trying to concentrate on some specific object, and is referring to their 'ability' to see it. Fun Fact 見 える is also sometimes used to describe the 'sense' of sight, and refers to whether anything is visible at all for the speaker."

(A) 込 む - To enter a state of doing (A) that will not be considered complete until 'success'. (A) 込 む - To enter a state of doing (A) that cannot be escaped from.

This form will be attached to the conjunctive form of other verbs. Despite the multiple meanings, 込 む can almost always be thought of as 'jamming (B) into (A)'. This means that whatever the (A) action is, will be something that is not easily entered, but also not easily escaped from."

Caution The kanji 遂 has a meaning similar to 'to get (something) over with'. Due to this, ついに will most often be used to highlight things that have finally happened after a significant period of time, or a long course of events.

In the same way as 'verge' in English, it implies a fairly big or somehow important event, and will not be used with standard occurrences. 際 に will appear after verbs in either their dictionary or past-tense forms, and after nouns. In the case of nouns, it will be preceded by の. While (A) is likely to be a temporary or one-off event, 際 に is not limited to one-off situations. It may also appear with regularly occurring events, but the way of reacting to that event may change depending on some one-off circumstances. Caution Although 際 に and 時 に may overlap in certain situations, 際 に will sound unnatural when the situation involves something that typically does not change, or always happens the same way."

As it is a structure that makes use of the noun ところ 'place' or 'spot', it puts more emphasis on the scene or situation, rather than the action itself. This pattern follows verbs in their ている or ていた forms. Also, rather than appearing with に, へ is sometimes used instead. Depending on the form of the verb, ところに may indicate being 'on the verge of (A)', 'partway through (A)', or having 'just finished (A)'. Compared to other ところ based structures, the addition of に or へ will often precede a (B) statement indicating that 'at the precise moment of (A), (B) happened'. This may either be positive or negative. Caution In many cases, ところに will be used when (A) is either a 'situation' or an 'emotion', and will not often be used in relation to unimportant or trivial actions, unless expressing the 'precise moment' where something unexpected happened during that trivial action. Caution When appearing with nouns, な-Adjectives, or い-Adjectives, ところに , へ, で, and を simply highlight that 'state of (A)'."

In this way, the more literal meaning is 'for (A), (A) is not possible'. It will be important to keep in mind that する does not have a potential form, so できない will be used in the latter half of this expression when paired with する verbs. Additionally, ない may sometimes be replaced with other structures that convey negation, such as ず. Caution Occasionally, the dictionary form of a verb will be replaced with the auxiliary verb う or よう volitional forms, and will then be followed by にも. The potential form of the same verb coming before ない will remain the same. Although the meanings are the same between both of these, the dictionary form tends to highlight psychological circumstances for why one 'cannot (A)', while the volitional form highlights more concrete or physical circumstances."

Only の is considered 'correct Japanese', but ん evolved to make things easier to say. ん is the most common form in spoken Japanese, and the use of の could be considered a bit formal, or 'stiff'.

However, the second common usage of は is to highlight contrast (making a comparison). When は is used after a number/counter, it regularly has this comparison meaning. This can be translated as 'or so', or 'at least'. Before は , the counter is regularly followed by くらい (or ぐらい ). This just softens the statement, and further highlights the 'or so' meaning. Despite being translated as 'at least', the comparative meaning of は itself is what creates the nuance of this grammar structure. The thing before は is being highlighted as an amount, while also implying that there are other amounts. This implication of another amount makes は sound as if it could mean 'as opposed to (B)'. So in essence, this grammar structure sounds like 'As for (A), as opposed to (B)', where (B) is not usually mentioned."

Sometimes these terms are simplified even further to 'other-move' (transitive), and 'self-move' (intransitive). Basically, this is the difference between verbs that require an object marked with を (transitive verbs), and those that only require が , to show that the subject itself is moving (intransitive). In Japanese, there are many transitive/intransitive pairs of verbs, and these will need to be memorized. Fun Fact In Japanese, the two ways in which all verbs can be described are an act/motion  ( 動作 ), and an act/motion upon something ( 作用 ). Fun Fact Although they are not traditionally grouped this way, する and なる may also be thought of as a transitive/intransitive pair. This is due to する always implying that something is being controlled (acted upon), while なる always implies that something happens on its own, or cannot be controlled."

This is similar to the contrastive use of は . In order to identify this nuance of て , we will need to think about whether the things being described are happening one after the other, or are simply describing '(A), and then (B)'. Let's look at some examples. Due to this 'contrast' that is shown with て , sometimes it is translated as 'while (A), also (B)'. The primary difference between this nuance of て , and other 'while' or 'but' grammar points, is that (A) and (B) will always have equal weight/importance in a て sentence. Comparatively, structures like けど , のに , だが and similar points will usually imply that either (A) or (B) is more important in some way."

It presents (A) as 'minimum' or 'light' examples, and therefore implies that anything greater than (A) would be more than can be handled, imagined, etc. In this use, it is often translated as 'just (A)', or 'merely (A)'. だに will appear directly following verbs in their dictionary form . This is a formal structure, and will be seen far more often in literature than it will be spoken. Despite this, it is actually quite common in anime and manga when characters are being dramatic. As (A) presents a 'minimum', it will often be a word which expresses something that depicts the difference between reality and fantasy. For example, if (A) was 想像 するだに 'even in my imagination'. The 'minimum' is the imagination, for which the opposite end of the spectrum would be 'in reality'."

The case marking particle と in this expression highlights a 'result'. However, the addition of structures like the conjunction particles が, or たら , to the past tense of する will indicate that something interrupted (A), and therefore it was unable to be completed. In these cases, the translation becomes 'to have tried to do (A), but (B)', 'was about to (A), but (B), or 'was on the verge of (A), but (B)'. う and よう mark volition (the express intent to do something), while とする adds the nuance that the express intent has been decided, and all that remains is to 'do' the action. Due to this, when something interrupts a ようとする verb, it strongly suggests that (B) is/was highly unanticipated."
